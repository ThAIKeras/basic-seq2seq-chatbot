You're sweet.
What crap?
Thank God!  If I had to hear one more story about your coiffure...
Sometimes I wonder if the guys we're supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with, you know?
Can you at least start wearing a bra?
You did what?
If Kat's not going, you're not going.
You burn, you pine, you perish?
Bianca Stratford.  Sophomore. Don't even think about it
I could start with your haircut, but it doesn't matter.  She's not allowed to date until her older sister does.  And that's an impossibility.
It's a lung cancer issue
Dead at forty-one.
It's off. The whole thing.
And why would I do that?
Enough with the Barbie n' Ken shit. I know.
William would never have gone to a state school.
That's never been proven
I don't really think you warrant that strong an emotion.
And why would I do that?
You -- covered in my vomit.
Who?
I hate him.
Hey man. . .  You don ' t think I can be "cool"?  You don't think I can be "laid back" like everyone else?
You know what they say
Look up, sunshine
It's Scurvy's.  His date got convicted. Where'd you get the dress?
Oh huh
Yeah.  She left with some bikers Big ones.  Full of sperm.
The situation is, my man Cameron here has a major jones for Bianca Stratford.
It says here you exposed yourself to a group of freshmen girls.
With the teeth of your zipper?
But -- who -- what --?
Did He not choose a carpenter's son to reveal Himself to the world?
I don't want you to wait for me.
There'll be a time.
If you won't accept our proposal, we'll simply find someone who will.
Thousands.
Wait!  I've waited seven years already!  How much longer do you want me to wait?
Damn God!
What did they say about Granada before today?
You did not hear me, Don Colon.  Not my horse.
Yes.  It would be a pity, wouldn't it?  Call him back!
My father always degraded me.  Killed my self-esteem.  And my mother was blind.
Yeah, she went blind giving birth to me. She went to fucking black market doctor to induce me.
Yeah, yeah...bad doctor gave her bad drugs which made her go blind.  And my father blamed me for her blindness...
Yeah, he hated me from day when I was born.  Put it out.  Can you put the cigarette out?
So you were never a prostitute?
I'm just trying to find out who you are.
If I tell you, will you arrest me?
Yeah.  He finished awhile ago.
Yeah.
I know.  Relax.  Take it easy.  Don't worry, we'll get those fuckers.
Pretty.
Maybe you don't care about that either.  Prettiest suspect I've had in awhile.
Something back home?
We don't know that yet.  It's much too early.  There's a lot to be done.
There are two bodies found at this point.
You know you can't do that.  C'mon.
We don't know.  When I have more I'll let you know.
Jesus Christ.
Look asshole.  I've been threatened by better than you.
I'll meet you on one condition - I get exclusivity and you surrender to me.
What?  It doesn't work that way.
Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.
Alright, alright - don't hurt me! Please, it's in my book, in my purse!
Don't speak Russian!
Because I don't like your ugly language. I heard enough of it in school!  Now speak Czech or English.  And don't fool around anymore.  You almost got us thrown out!
The video of Milos and Tamina - I told you to erase it.
And the whore's murder?  You didn't erase that either, did you?  Don't lie, I won't be angry.
Put the camera down, Oleg.
Because I am the director.  Don't you realize, if it wasn't for my film, for my talent, my idea to do this - no way would we be sitting here right now.
You want the tape?  There it is!
Evidence.  Of a homicide.
But you knew that, right?
Don't you get it?  He knew he was gonna get caught!  That's why he videotaped Eddie's murder - he thinks he's gonna get off.
Right. Just a sec.
Okay, come on down.
Yes.
The antenna has to be replaced.
It doesn't have to be, Hal. It's more dangerous to be out of touch with Earth. Let me have manual control, please.
I'm fine, Daddy. When are you coming home?
I'm terribly sorry. I was just on my way down to meet you. I saw your ship dock and I knew I had plenty of time, and I was on my way out of the office when, suddenly, the phone rang.
I'm afraid it can and it will be kept under wraps as long as it is deemed to be necessary by the Council. And of course you know that the Council has requested that formal security oaths are to be obtained in writing from every- one who had any knowledge of this event. There must be adequate time for a full study to be made of the situation before any con- sideration can be given to making a public announcement.
Roger.
Vodka.
No, man, I think I'll have a vodka.
Here you go sweetheart, throw it my way.
In the back.  Down the other corridor.
You got a girl... shit... the generosityof women never ceases to amaze me.
Just get in the car and keep your mouth shut.
I thought you said bullshit and experience are all it takes.
Me and my bunch hit a dealer in the middle of a sale. It's the kind of money nobody ever reports stolen. I was sittin' pretty, livin' in the high cotton, then somebody fingered me for another job. ... Some psycho who's out there capping people with some cop's gun.
You catch on real fast...Okay, Jack, let's talk deal. How much of my money you gonna let me keep?
Tryin' to save his girl, man. He's in another world.
I'm tellin' you the man's in love... he wants to be a hero for his girl.
Be polite. Say hello.  This is Candy.
I had it impounded.  Come on, we'll use it for haulin' you back to the slam.
I don't know about you, but I could use a drink... I'll buy you one.  It'll be my good-bye present.
And you're tellin' me you don't want any of this cash?
You are an awesomely weird cop. Sure wish there were more like you runnin' around out here.
Spare met Jack. I'm into legit investments from here on in.
I'm taking my prisoner back to jail.
I'm heading out. How about you?
What's wrong with that?
Bullshit?  I'll tell you about bullshit.  My gun's a real weapon in the hands of a real maniac who knows how to use it.  It isn't my macho bullshit that's killing people, my gun is ...
I didn't get burned, two cops did. Listen, I'll tell you about personnel responsibility.  I like to get the job done right.  And if I don't get my job done right... I'm for shit.
That's right.  I'm not like you. I'm not gonna sit on my ass wondering what's right and what's wrong... There's a psycho out there killing people with my gun and I'm gonna get him.  Because it's my job. And if you don't get that...
Come on, they were a little old for a slumber party.
So what?
Hey, Come on, shrink time's over. They wouldn't go see some old girlfriend.
Shut up.
Not bad, not bad.
You know exactly where they are!
That's me.  But I don't know who she is... where did you find her?
Yes, of course, but... The Stones are shut! They have to be open for it to work.
That's what I'm saying.
Absolutely sure There's the triple suns on her gloves!
I'll help her, I promise, but I think you should tell me where the Stones are!
I... I don't know! We hardly know each other... it takes time!
Listen, the last time I admitted to a woman I loved her ... I never saw her again.
It there's one thing I don't need advice on, it's how to drive.
...And now you're making fun of me? I'm warning you! If you don't take me after all these years of sacrifice, I'll never forgive you!!
Does it get any better or what!
Dear listeners, your favorite DJ is alive and kicking. It's seven o'clock and time for the news. Tune in tomorrow for another adventure.
I suppose that means "Hi" ?
I'm going to see the Diva sing. What's the matter?... Do I look bad?
Good philosophy..see good in bad.. I like..I prepare number one dessert.. special for you and pussy..
And the Stones?  Did you find them in the wreckage?
...What do you mean?
To fame.. salud..
Sure.  I'll call the guy.
I'm not using him again for anything.  He was worthless.  You have bridge here Saturday?
Mixed hard bondage.  Rape films. Sick shit.  Buy five, get one free.
Machine's in?
Put the gun down, take the handcuffs.  Handcuff yourself to the bed.
One million dollars, Dino.  How much did he tell you he had...
Don't think I won't.
Easy enough for you.
That's right, you just stood there and watched, because you "felt like it."  Almost makes you worse.
Look at him.  You think he played it square?  How much did he give you, how much did he keep for himself?
Twenty-five.
I don't know, where are yours?
I'm not mixed up in anything, hayseed.  What are you talking about?
Yeah, I'm a real genius.  What choices have I got?  Fuck, just because I know about stuff like tonight doesn't mean I deal it.  I work a job.  It beats pumping gas, beats making hamburgers.
You can't sit there all day watching the parade of losers that comes into that place without going numb.  So what? Am I gonna go off and be a race car driver?  Go to Harvard?  Run for President?  What about you, pops?
I see a ring on your finger.  You have any kids?
So, you have a wife and kid waiting for you in Pennsylvania... what are you doing mixed up in all this?
It's not my money.  The woman I got it from is never going to give it a second thought.  Let's not make a big deal out of this, okay?  Go be a race car driver.  Go run for President.  Whatever.
I'm afraid I don't...
Hello, Mrs. Mathews, my name's Thomas Jones, I'm a state licensed investigator...
Will you let me look?
You're probably right, and I probably won't find anything. I don't have a right to ask this, and you can kick me out of your house if you want, but this is my profession and there's a part of me that can't let it go.  Police are just as human as you or I.  They could have missed something.  They probably didn't.  Wouldn't you rather know?
None too discreet, is he?
He's an imbecile.  I tried to warn my daughter, but what can you do?
It was bad.
I can't find him.
I gotta get to the library before it closes.  Killer physics test.
Maybe you shouldn't be working here so much.  You don't want to get stuck waiting tables for the rest of your life.
Kristen was the last child left of the people who killed Freddy.  Maybe Freddy can't get to new kids without someone like me.  Someone to bring them to him.
Give her time.  Beauty is skin deep.
Sorry!! Sorry that you and your tennis pals torched this guy who's now after me. In case you haven't been keeping score, it's his fucking banquet, and I'm the LAST COURSE!!
Mother, you've just murdered me.  Take that to your goddamn therapy...
What are you talking about?  My "condition"?...
Come on downstairs.  He won't hurt you. He needs us both.
It's the model you've been saving up for. I wanted you to have it for your trip.
They're waiting for us...but let's keep this dream stuff between you and me.
Yeah...So that's him.  And you're not crazy.
Yeah.  I'm just aces.
Then we'll find another way.
I don't believe this... All that gore you paint in the comics and you're squeamish?
Stick around, please?
I'd sooner swim!
'Us?'
Oh it does???
Wonderful!
I did go.  Just back.  Reef, these are a couple of our passengers - Sir Ian Hunt, and Dr. Clifford Kent.  My exec, Commander Richard Holloway.
Nothing we can do, now.
Thank you.
Sometimes things are simpler than you think. Let me ask you a question.
About Jack? No. Have you checked out the tax bill on your father's farm lately?
Has anybody offered to buy it?
Tell you what. You get me close to a big buck by ten, kid, there's another hundred bucks in it.
Yeah.
You think so.
You take care of your end, kid, I'll take care of mine.
You understand what I'm saying? I want a deer, a dead one, not a cripple or whatthefuck.
And you'll get your extra hundred bucks.
Shit.
No.
No I didn't see anybody I know. No I don't want to go to school here tomorrow. I want to go home.
I don't want to be here. Don't worry, I love you, Daddy, I do. But I want to go home.
I called Mommy.
Yes.
I... because I want to go home. She said she'd come and get me.
See, I knew you'd be mad.
I told her I wanted to come home. Daddy, don't be mad at me.
Got here just in time. Go ahead. Jump in line. Maybe you'll win a prize.
Nothing, Wade, I've been thinking. You don't get enough appreciation around here and it's time we changed things a little.
So?
Wade, that wasn't smart. Going out right after the man's father-in-law shot himself. Let it go. Call it a favor to me.
Mel's doing some business with me. It's nice to do favors for people you do business with. He was in a hurry. No big deal.
What's the difference? Take my truck, take a rest -- stop worrying about Mel Gordon. Have you decided what to do with your old man's place -- he going to stay there?
Don't light that in here. I'm allergic.
Maybe.
Could be.
For a while.
Okay. She's fine.
The truck's here. Looks like they've stayed inside since the snow started.
Jesus Christ. Mr. Gordon, when I come all the way to serve somebody a summons, I don't call ahead for an appointment.
I'm issuing you a ticket. Moving violation.
Yesterday morning, you passed a stopped school bus, which was flashing its lights, then you--
Don't ever put your hands on me, Mr. Gordon.
Don't give me a hard time, Mr. Gordon. I'm just --
Yes. Here's your ticket.
Nothing.
He was scheduled to testify for a committee investigating organized crime in New England and the construction business.
Twombley.
You think Jack shot him?
They were out deer hunting, right? Jack probably heard the gun go off, then came back and found the body.
Wade, are you alright?
Yes dear?
Alice... I...
You read my mind.
He's busy being dead.
Goddamn right I did.  I asked for a tough-as-nails speech and you gave me diplomatic bullshit.  What's the point in having a speech if I have to ad-lib?
Thanks.  Wrote it last night.
About goddamn time.
Air Force One, acknowledged.  tNT. EMERGENCY PARACHUTE LAUNCH RAMP.
Stand by.
Come on, Alice.
Call up Petrov and order Stravanavitch' S release.
They've gotta be joking.
What?
But that's the point, Jim. We're right here.
They're still alive, but the loyalists plan to start killing hostages in forty minutes.
Sir, the Speaker of the House attacked this administration on national television.  You can't afford to leave that hanging.
They better. Fuel's almost gone.
Yes I did...
Yes it did.  Mr. Dunn, can I ask you a personal question?
Um...  Do you people scream right when you... you know.
Ted, please.  You're just making things difficult for yourself.
Ted.  I don't know why you got on this flight.  I don't know what you're trying to prove.
We can't go back.  We had something very special, but it's all over.
Kramer, the WORP control handle just came off in my hand.
I think so.
Systems check positive.  Look, Elaine, I...
Life support check.  Elaine, it's obvious you've been ignoring me.  You're a woman. I can relate to that.
There's nothing wrong with me, Elaine. What about tonight -- just you and me.  We can be alone.  I can get rid of everyone else on the ship -- I've already proven <u>that</u>.
Sixteen 'C', why?
A b...
Look at this wiring.  It's shorting out under high temperatures.
I know you've been subtly spreading the word that I'm having a breakdown.
Oh, yes. Come in, Paul. Rex will be right out.
Well...not for another two hours.
No, I mean we can't <u>land</u> for another two hours. Fog has closed down everything this side of the mountains. We've got to go through to Chicago!
Ted!
I just don't want to go over it any more.
I have been patient and I've tried to help, but you wouldn't even let me do that.
It takes so many things to make love last. Most of all it takes respect. And I can't live with a man I don't respect!
Be patient, Ted. No one expects you to get over this immediately.
Uh-huh.
All right, he's on final now! Put out all runway lights except niner.
Oh, Stewardess. My husband is very sick. Can you do something, please?
Yes, of course. We both had fish. Why?
No. No thank you.
The young woman at the front said you might know where he is.
Here?
A rubber.  A condom.  You know... Coney Island whitefish?  Men, human men, put them on their, uh -- penises -- to protect against having babies.  You need this for anything?
Stay back!  I'm okay.
You are married?
We mate for life.  Divorce... is a strange concept to us.
To the... to the beach?
Where is the drug?  Where have they taken it?
You look very good.
Yeah... I seen him around.  High- roller dude named Strader.  Joshua Strader.  Runs a club on the west side.  Encounters.
That's all I know.  You want anything more, you ask somebody else.
Granger and Pitts have one hell of a caseload... and I would have thought with Jetson here being the first Newcomer plainclothes, and Hubley's body being found over in the Newcomer community...
Position?
Talk to me, Hudson.
I'm afraid so.  The crash did too much damage.  The overload is inevitable, at this point.
Look, I believe you, but there are going to be some heavyweights in there.  You got Feds, you got interstellar commerce commission, you got colonial administration, insurance company guys...
Just tell them what happened.  The important thing is to stay cool and unemotional.
Yeah?  Maybe the organisms like the heat, that's why they built...
She's right.
PDT'S.  Personal-Data Transmitters. Every adult colonist had one surgically implanted.
All right, I guess.  One hell of a hangover.  Look, Ripley... I...
Aye-firmative.
On my way.
All right!  She's alive.  I believe it.  But we gotta get moving!  Now!
Hey...hey!  Look, Crowe and Dietrich aren't dead, man.
I don't know, an acid hole in a duct.  Something under the floors, not on the plans. I don't know!
The 'maze'?  You mean the air ducts?
You're really something, ace.
Look!
Sixty, maybe seventy families.
Is her mother still lying on the floor?
I'm so relieved.
Yes! Back! Back! Listen - don't you know where you are?
We are in the Residence of the Fartsbishop of Salzburg.
Stanzi!
Madame. How can I help you?
What?
Be careful!
Yes. He is a little strange.
Excuse me, Sire, but what do you think these could be? Being a foreigner, I would love to learn.
Did we vote in the end for German or Italian?
Twenty-six.
Your Majesty, Herr Mozart -
He's here.
I want you to come back with me to Salzburg, my son.
Do any pupils come to the house?
Then how does he pay for all this? Does he work at all?
Really? What is it he's writing?
Of course not. You're a good girl. You're very kind to do this. Next time you're sure they'll be out of the house, let me know, will you?
I'd like to try them someday. I'm not sure I'd be much good at it.
Animals?
Is my pupil still anxious to learn the art of music?
Really? Perhaps your dear wife might care to profit from my instruction?
Well. Since it appears nobody is eager to hire my services, could you favour me with a little money instead?
If a man cannot earn, he must borrow.
No doubt, sir. But I am endowed with talent, and you with money. If I offer mine, you should offer yours.
I know; it's outrageous. Still, if the public doesn't like one's work one has to accept the fact gracefully.
Well, I can speak for the Emperor. You made too many demands on the royal ear. The poor man can't concentrate for more than an hour and you gave him four.
I think it's marvelous. Truly.
I think you overestimate our dear Viennese, my friend. Do you know you didn't even give them a good bang at the end of songs so they knew when to clap?
I wouldn't presume. All the same, if it wouldn't be imposing, I would like you to see my new piece. It would be a tremendous honour for me.
Grazie, mio caro, Wolfgang!
Yes. Can I - could I help you, in any way?
My dear friend, it would be my greatest pleasure.
Of course.
Then, let us try together. I'd regard it as such an honour. Tell me, what is this work?
Yes, yes - go on. The Voca Me. Suddenly sotto voce. Write that down: sotto voce, pianissimo. Voca me cum benedictis. Call me among the blessed.
Taking out what you should never have put in.
I regret it is not too familiar.
Incredible.
Show her in. Then go to bed.
Yes, sir.
At my flat. I'm off at midnight and...
Call me Alex.
Shall I be forced to feed you, Mr. Kessler?
Very nice.
The zoo?
Don't you remember?
No.
No.
No.
No, but we're about to.
So they said.
In time I'm sure it will all come back to you.
Listen, at least it's warm in here.
I heard that.
Not far enough. Come on.
You don't have to say anything.
If I was still alive, I probably would.
Thank you.
What about the zoo?
I want you to meet some people.
Roger Mathison, Doctor.
He's on the telephone.
You here again? What do you want?
Where do you think I've been?  I took the baby for a stroll in the park.
Not at all. That's Alexander Hamilton's idea[5] - the finest banking mind this country has ever known. Those are his exact words, gentlemen. Character!  It's the only thing you can bank on, and it's the only thing that will pull this country out of the doldrums.
Oh yes, of course. There was someone with me. A lady.
If you don't mind, Inspector, I'd rather not say - that is, unless it becomes absolutely essential. You see, she's married.
You understand?
I'm sorry, Dude, butI
But after all, you can't take blood from a stone.
Well
Well, aren't you going to invite me?
Now Phyllis, if you don't invite me, I'm coming anyway.
No, they won't. Not when you are there. Oh, please, be a sport. Please ask me.
Don't you know?
I want to be near you!
You've no right to do this to her, Mr. Cluett. Why don't you think it over? It's only gonna get you into a lot of trouble.
No?  Then maybe you'll understand, Mrs. Dickson. Oh, gee, he's crazy about you. Nobody knows it better than you. If he ever finds out, it'll kill him.
Ho, ho, ho, yourself! I wouldn't laugh if I were you. You may not suspect it, but I'm still attractive - to some.
Well . . .
Tomorrow night?
Oh, no! It's not for you. You're only going to get married. Mrs. Dickson and I are going to go on the honeymoon.
And what's more, keep up the good work and who knows - some day you'll be the fellow sitting behind that desk . . .  Not a bad thought, eh?
The clock opposite the vault was stopped by a bullet at 12:09.
If he can do it, yes.
All right. Send down to the vaults and have our reserve cash sent up here right away.
Matt, come here!
Come here, honey!
All right, dear.
It couldn't have been earlier?
Yes, I know. Cause the Dooley sisters weren't in yet.
There you are!
They're starting to come in already. Yeah. Yeah. Well, listen. Don't waste any time. Get all the money you can lay your hands on, and bring it down here right away. Step on it.
The sheriff says it was a gang of drunk Kansas boys.
He's not bad at it.
Not yet. But I'm hoping.
No, really. You're wife said she needed some help, seeing as you were so fat you couldn't find your --
Yeah.
What will be?
Missed you too, cousin.
Shakespeare.  He's European.
You're right, sir.
On account of we're robbing it.
It's a secret.
I'd appreciate that.
I fooled them into thinking I was alone.
I think he's already feeling better.
Maybe, maybe...
Fine. How'd it go out here?
Jim was old enough...
Railroad burned him out too. You couldn't have stopped him.
Yeah.
I'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time.
We know, Ma. Now we got to get you to Doc Mimms.
Me neither.
Laws don't touch men like Thaddeus Rains. Only justice does.
When my name makes them cry in their sleep. When I've brought them to ashes.
Not that day. I am guilty of many things, but that was Mr. Thaddeus Rains and Parker, that day.
I'm the same age you were when you went off to war.
I'm doing you folks a favor --
I look forward to seeing it.
I can't believe this.
Is it a what?
I'm ignoring you.
What do you want, Courtney?
I'm not supposed to.  But I can make an exception.
I think, Evelyn, that we've...lost touch.
I know her. I knew her.
Yes, naturally.
Where are you going?
Patrick?
Impressive. Very nice. Let's see Paul Owen's card.
Just...say...no.
Oh no. I have no plans.
Hmmmm.
Isn't it ridiculous? Coming all the way up here, but you know. They really are the best.
You actually listen to Whitney Houston? You actually have a Whitney Houston CD? More than one?
Well...
0h no. Informal conversations, mostly. What's that, Stoli?
Too true. You know, Bateman-people tend to reveal so much more about themselves when they're in a relaxed setting, don't you think?
Personally I think the guy went a little nutso. Split town for a while. Maybe he did go to London. Sightseeing. Drinking. Whatever. Anyway, I'm pretty sure he'll turn up sooner or later.  I mean, to think that one of his friends killed him, for no reason whatsoever would be too ridiculous. Isn't that right, Patrick?
They're okay. BATEMAN Their early work was a little too New Wave for my taste. But then Sports came out in 1983, I think they really came into their own, commercially and artistically.
Then you've gotta ask him about that.
You're right. It's -- a working relationship. Don't know what I was expecting.
What?
He has thousands of employees, Milo --
Milo --
Milo, you --
Right... What's that mean again?
It's just -- I kind of feel the need to do something with my ability. Create something...
Gimme the coordinates?
Would you like a Coke or something?
You're making me young again.
...My dad was a compulsive gambler. Only he didn't think he was. That applied to guys who didn't have a "system." "Losers," who played games of chance. He could "read" people, so chance had nothing to do with it. No matter how deep a hole he dug himself, he'd give you the whole speech. And you'd better not point out the obvious.  His creditors would catch up to him. Loan sharks or whatever. He'd wake us in the middle of the night. Off we'd go, again.
Nothing does. Still. I want him to like me.
Keep looking.
Any irregularity in the pattern.
No. Please.
There're so many disinformation sites about Gary already. Where he has devil's horns or they crop him in with Saddam Hussein.
Gary.
Hey, we got seed money for the startup! A million-five!
Damn. 'Have to go back over there.  Be so much easier if we could walk in the front door.
That's very clever. Do you know any other poems?
Thank you, that's beautiful. To your health.
Kiss me.
Thank you, Exposition.
Yes?
Yes Basil?
I went to Oxford and excelled in several subjects, but I ended up specializing in foreign languages. I wanted to travel -- see the world. In my last year I was accepted into the M.O.D. in the Cultural Studies sector. I thought I was off on an exciting career, but my job was to read everything printed in every country. It's very boring. My whole day is spent reading wedding announcements in Farsi. If I do well with this case, I finally get promoted to field operative...
I beg your pardon?
Excuse me?
I'm sorry?
Mr. Powers, please. I know that you must be a little confused, but we have a very serious situation at hand. I would appreciate it if you'd concentrate on our mission and give your libido a rest.
A Chigro?
We don't use the term 'Negro' anymore. It's considered offensive.
Let me see.
Look at her hands, baby! Those are carpenter's hands.
We've got a freaked out square and world annihilation is his bag.  You go get help. I'm gonna stay here and keep an eye on the bad Doctor.
Too right, youth. That's why I need you to lead the troops.
Listen, Vanessa, whatever happens, I just want you to know that I feel bad about shagging that Italian girl. I had a sip of sake and all of the sudden, I don't know what happened. The whole time I was shagging her-- I mean really shagging her, I mean it was crazy, I was like a huge mechanical piston, in and out, IN and OUT!--
Anyways, what I'm trying to say is that if you want me to be a one-woman man, well, that's just groovy, because... I love you.
No, no, I want you to have it, even if it's my last piece.
Right. Okay. Moving on.
Hello, Scott. I'm your father, Dr. Evil.  I have a son! I have a son! Everyone, I have a son!  Someday, Scott, this will all be yours.
Right.  Oh, hell, let's just do what we always do. Let's hijack some nuclear weapons and hold the world hostage.  Gentlemen, it's come to my attention that a breakaway Russian Republic called Kreplachistan will be transferring a nuclear warhead to the United Nations in a few days. Here's the plan. We get the warhead, and we hold the world ransom...  ...FOR ONE MILLION DOLLARS!
No, he's really evil.
You don't get rain like you used to in England. A good shower that's the ticket. Stiffens resolve, puckers the spirit, quells the namby-pamby in a man.
This isn't a game.
Rules are made to be broken.
Then who wins?
The Institute ... the funding ...
You're mad.
Ahh. Perfect fit. The luxury of a hand-made shoe. As unique as a face or a fingerprint. Or should I say DNA?
Why should they think that?
Frankly that's how I remember it.
Perhaps your memory plays tricks, Mrs. Peel.
Did he say who?
Oh, well ...  Just my type, Mrs. Peel.
Keeping a stiff upper lip?
It's called Black Leather.
Must be. Trubshaw's busy. I'll send Mother ...
Well, I can't possibly go like this.
Perhaps I'd better start calling you doctor again, Mrs. Peel --
I feel sure of it.
She was ...
Ugh ...
Rick's got an important announcement to make.
When do the girls get to the party?
So does Debbie.
What? I'm sorry, sir, I can't hear you.
Good...
Now, I want you to lie down and drift off to slumberland.
Yes...
Let's get naked.
My pleasure, Al... Always happy to help out in a pinch...  Excuse me. I better call my service... tell them where I am.
Gary, you're quite an animal.
Just in love with everybody. It's really a beautiful planet. I love you, Rick. I love you guys. I love everybody.
It's really not all your fault. I was talking to Mike earlier and he had a lot of problems. Personal things, you know. Made some bad investments. At least now he's peaceful...
Of course, sir. That explains it. Leather is a very good source of vitamin E.
Olivier's in that, right?
Very.
Right. Give me the will to live. Let me go first.
No.  I need a drink.
That was an accident! Jesus Christ, why did you have to go in there so fucking early? Why didn't you listen to me!
I wanted to know why you messed with my station assignment. I mean, is this really gonna have to one of those big brother -- little brother "you broke my GI Joe and I'm still pissed" games?
Hey! You don't know me --
So that's it? Big bad brother's gonna ride my ass till I cough blood?
C'mon, let's crawl home.
-- I tried, y'know? Helen's right. I don't have all the answers, but goddamn it, I've got some.  Look, you're gonna do what you have to, and maybe I shouldn't have gotten in the way. I'm your brother, not your father. Go on. You gotta go somewhere? Go...
When I was twenty.
Got anything to drink in there?
Who's doing this?
Then who --
I don't have a story.
-- Another backdraft.
And Cosgrove. Coppers figured he laundered money for the mob before getting into real estate. They weren't very high on Seagrave, either.
Who all ended up wearing candles for faces...  Swayzak's up to his ass in this somehow. Guy can barely hold a drink in his hand, he's so scared.
Stephen's not staying here now, Brian. He moved out last April.
"Probationary Fireman Brian McCaffrey, on his very first fire, showed the kind of bravery and courage of a veteran firefighter when he risked life and limb to double-check a burning floor alone, emerging victoriously with Anna Rodriguez, a seamstress for the North Shore Clothing Company... McCaffrey first gained prominence as the subject of a 1972 Pulitzer Prize winning photograph taken at the scene of his father's death..."
I'll be there.
I'll be there, goddamn it!
McCaffrey, hold this for us.
Investigator Rimgale.
Yeah? At least she's alive! I see people get killed every day! Worse yet, tortured first and then killed! The nuns got off easy. Jeez. Cigarette burns. Everyone's all upset about fucking cigarette burns. I'll show you cigarette burns!
I'm a Catholic.
I forgive you.
Good. I'll give him an extra 10 grand for his trouble. I hate that motherfucking house and --
I've been dodging bullets since I was fourteen. No one can kill me. I'm fucking blessed. I'm fucking Catholic.
...that simpleton is holding back the race.  They got rid of us and keep those two buffoons, Mantan and Sleep 'N Eat, y'knowwhatI'msayin'?
Hook you up?  The Mau-Mau's?  You must be smoking.  Why in the world would I want to hook up a bunch of red, black and green flag-waving pseudo revolutionairies?
Who are you revolting against?
Please.
Delacroix.
What makes you think he would write a show about the Mau-Mau's.
You ain't happy about the green light?
And this is Manray.
Trust me.  Of course I still have to pitch it to my boss, but we'll have an answer one way or the other.
That's right.  Money turns the wheel.
I would prefer you not use that word in my presence.
What are there character traits?
Exactly!
And Sleep 'n Eat is his comical sidekick?
This could be bigger than "Amos and Andy."
Calm down, please.
The same old, same old.  Trying to get my stuff through.
It hit me like a ton of bricks.
The idea was out there in the universe.  Now what?
I'm gonna slit my wrists.  Cut my throat.  For the love of Joseph.
I don't want to hear it.
You're the one that put us together. We're friends.
He's just playing big brother.
Please don't go there.
I can't lie to him.  If he asks me something, I tell him what I think.
Now I'm privileged?!  Why?  Because I didn't grow up on food stamps and welfare?  Because I didn't call home a cardboard box?  No, I never ever went to bed hungry and I'm proud of it, too.  Whoever told you that living in poverty earns you somekind of badge of honor flat out lied to you.
If at first it's not what you want, just work that much harder, Peerless.
Son, Peerless is your name.  Now you might be one of these Hollywood types, change your name and all that but Peerless Dothan is on your birth certificate.
I guess he's still on the road. What kind of show is this?  Are they some Negroes in it without being buffoons?
Peerless, I didn't raise a buffoon. We have enough of those on television already.
I will.  And good luck with your show.  I hope it's a huge success. You've worked very hard.  You deserve it.
First, I would like to say I love the show.  It's very courageous. My parents marched in Selma, Alabama with Dr. King.
...the big apple, New York, New York.
Our Alabamy Home.  Now we're getting countrified.  We is Bama's.
Tell 'em what you mean Mistuh Mantan.
Give or cousins some of dem educated feets.
Well, homeboy, looks like he's at a funeral.
Good morning.
That is none of your business.
Not at all, sir.  I have a pair of good pistols that have already done execution, and are ready to do it again.
How do you do, sir?
It was with this sword that my late father, Harry James, God rest his soul, met Sir Huddelstone Fuddelstone, the Hampshire baronet, and was fatally run through the neck.  He was quite in the wrong, having insulted Lady Fuddelstone, when in liquor, at the Brentford Assembly.  But, like a gentleman, he scorned to apologize.
I am Harry James' son, and will act as becomes my name and quality.
The gentleman has nothing contraband.
Have you had one?
But, for a time... a passing fancy?
How can I believe that there is not a man who has inspired desires in you?
Have you not a man whom you value?
What!  You have not met a man worthy of your attention?
Then you have never loved?  Your heart is empty.
It is nonetheless a misfortune, and you will know it when you love.
That is true, but it seems to me impossible that you should be unhappy in love.
I agree; but God put us on earth to take that risk.
I believe you, and I see I must hasten to leave, for otherwise I shall become the unhappiest of men.
By loving you, with no hope of possessing you.
Then you must get it.
In so far as I can tell these things -- no.  I believe the Chevalier won the money fairly.
Now, just have a little patience, my boy.  Your birthday isn't until next week.
Well, we'll just have to wait and see, won't we?
You know that was like a quadruple negative?
Maybe he's dead too. Maybe you killed them both, Mueller --
We found him like this...
This is one of those interrogation tricks, isn't it? You don't give me a cigarette till I tell you more.
Jesus!
Mueller was alone in the cabin?
Why?
You hated West more than any of us.
You're the only one missing a grenade.
Coast Guard, special detective detail. We feel this incident may have put the beaches of Florida at risk.
How many murders did you cover up? One? Five? Maybe an even ten.
I didn't --
He can wait. Kendall's out of surgery.
Don't be. I'm not cut out to deal with the West's of the world.
I thought you said that wasn't a compliment.
Good cop/bad cop?
Being back here. Gives me the willies.
You did more than try. You cracked Dunbar in less than three minutes, as an investigator you're phenomenal --
Yeah.
Seven guys. What was it you said? You were "just starting to believe I wasn't the guy people said".
Mueller. He's as bad as West and we both know it. Now I can't do it, cause I'm tied up, but we get the others to go along --
Someone else can do the deed, it doesn't have to be you. Maybe Nunez too, he's got a tendency to follow Mueller, but the rest of us can come out ahead -- the guys who took out their Sergeant's killers! We'll move the bodies out to the creek and say we came over the hill right as they fragged West, all we gotta do is tell the story right.
Because he'd shot Mueller.
Like I said, I was in the kitchen. When I came out, Mueller and Pike were dead, Nunez and Childs were hit and Dunbar was gone.
Childs.
The fuck are you talking about --
Bullshit --
Shut up!
We know.
Sorry, kid. I don't do charity.
I don't expect to.
It's not a woman, it's a fish. No one ever catches her.
I can get it. I can just...
Well, we were all set to, but there was a complication.
I am a footnote in that story. I am the context for your great adventure. Which never happened! Incidentally! You were selling novelty products in Wichita the day I was born.
Friend of yours? Did you help him out of a bind?
No Dad, they don't. I do not like the story. Not anymore, not after a thousand times. I know all the punchlines, Dad. I can tell them as well as you can.  For one night, one night in your entire life, the universe does not revolve around Edward Bloom. It revolves around me and my wife. How can you not understand that?
Oh, so you know.
Somehow, you're better. Different. You're getting ready to go. And I say...
There is no softer ground than town.
Wow. Wow, you just said it. I was expecting to dance around this for another half hour.
It's more than they thought. They're going to stop chemo.
Probably tonight.
He's up with your father.
He just fell asleep. Josephine's with him.
What do you mean?
Do you want to stop?
We'll stop then.
Hang on hang on, sorry, but like, who are you?
What are you doing here?
Uh. Do you like England?
He says you are very sad ridiculous man. I don't agree of course. And that you must pay someone to have sex like a prostitute. Nadia is a prostitute. I'm sorry.
He wants money.
Sorry?
Have you got your passport?
Shut up. Have you got your passport?
So what did you want? I think we understand each other, no?
You don't understand you either.
What was her name?
Right.
You didn't have to do this.
Well that's good. I'm happy to hear it.
Hey.
No, ma'am.
Can I put it in your mouth?
Now wait...
I know about how she was like. But we was different. I's the only person she talked to about it. How she's abused. Terrible things, Gill, just terrible...
It gets worse there. Leavin' me to my own mind. That's just not good.
BOY! YOU KEEP THAT GUN POINTED AT ME!  You need to kill a man, all you gotta have is a good reason.  You know she been here with me, don't cha? Been all over town, givin' up that switch you thought was your own.
Put all your love and dreams into one woman... she turn around and give it all to another man. That's a good reason to paint the wall with me, kid. She'd fear ya then. Cuz there won't be no more question in her mind. She with a real man now. A real KILLER!
Well I'm woke now... you can take this off.
Uh-uh.
Anything.
Don't think that'd be wise.
I know you didn't. But you a grown girl. You can handle it. I got to.
Nuh-uh.
THIS IS HOW YOU HANDLING IT? THIS IS HOW YOU HANDLING IT?
Get me ten bags of mulch.
You feelin' sick?
Yeah, I know.
All my life I been puttin' out your fires, with you givin' out your snatch to every waggin' dick in this town. And you gonna lay the blame at my feet? Well, I ain't gonna take that.
Only thing I'm sorry for is listenin' to my parents and having you instead of doin' what I should'a done.
Charlie...
No.
I don't think he'd feel it.
Where would you look for the mafia?
I stole them.
Ichiro --
Smells like Bayonne at low tide.
Big enough.
It's a new deal.  ... coming with me tomorrow?
Luck.
Sure, but then I just pull out the photos.
No one's keeping him here.
Why would you care?
Why?
What?
Twenty-four hours, detective.
We were worried to death.  It's awfully kind of you.
Come here.
Like what?
Okay, but don't kill him.  Save a little for everybody.  A masterpiece.
Yeah.  I got it.
Prosit.
Sorry.
I'm doing okay.
Yeah.  But that's what I wanted to talk to you about.
No.  I got a problem.
I think I'm starting to empathize with these Nexus-sixes.
Do you recognize any of them?
And who do I go to about you?
Sounds like I'm an ass-hole either way, but the answer is still no.
I work alone.
If they are smart, they take naps.
Because it's not.
Andies only simulate suffering -- if they're programmed for it.
No, I don't.
Memory implant.  She was programmed. But I think she has transcended her conditioning.  I think she was beginning to suspect.
I mean you're not helping! Why is that, Leon?
What's your problem?
How do you do?
Fallout shelter. There's a difference.
Are you French?
Well, your business must not be sports memorabilia, because this one Mantle card right here--  --is worth six thousand dollars all by its little self.
So what?!  I've got two of him!  And this many DiMaggios and Robinsons. I was holding these out, too.
Please don't follow me.  Don't do it!
Hey, you know. I was thinking...
He's a former boyfriend. We lived together for about six months.  And yes, I'll admit it.  I've still kind of got a thing for him.  That's what you wanted to know, isn't it?
What?!
Okay!
Maybe. But that's how it works.
Is that what you call it?
Sing it to me.
Yes!  Yes!  Oh, Lord!  Yes, oh, yes! But  where is the one who came last night -- all in yellow?!
Ooooohhhh!!  Of course! The father! Forgive me!!  Can you forgive me for my wasted life?!  Everything has been so awful!!
Yes.
Of course you do.  I'll stay here and pray.
No. I don't need money anymore -- I see that now.
The front door is open.  Will you be back?
Merci!
Why not just go to... Nome for supplies and a wife?  Isn't that closer?
No!  There's an Adult Bookstore back there!  I'll be right back!
Oh, my holy stars! A Negro!
How do you do, ma'am.
Good!
I'll be all right.
He'll catch him.  Hi. This is Nina Aron.  I've got a run away and I'm going to need police assistance.
I have to. If a complaint is made and the person resists obser--
Calm down, please. This man needs help and you need protection from him. That's obvious.
And now you must let me be the judge of that!
Let's all remain calm. That's the key thing.
I don't know. For this thing to blow over, it could take days.
Rather safe than sorry. That's my motto!
I've read up on it. I'll deliver the baby myself if I have to.
Yes, dear!
And I was wondering...if...if I could have a...
If I...you know...
Calvin Webber! What a thing to say!
Yes, dear, I know.
I knew you'd like him.
He's from Alaska.
You're goddamn right I am!
Where?!
No, I'm just going to walk around the neighborhood. Don't worry.
Yes.
Sure I do. I understand he's in the hospital. How is he?
You did? A human ear?
Yep, that's right. Let's take a look at it.
I have no hard proof of any of this. Her address is also on the photos. I think these people are involved with drugs, and murder. I think Frank is killing drug dealers and...  ...and somehow Frank is getting all their drugs. I had to tell you I got slightly more involved in this than you wanted me to, but it's over now for sure. I had to tell you about these things in case it could help.
I can't tell you the whole story. I. I took it upon myself. I can't say more.
No, not at all.
Only you and the photo lab.
Yes sir. I sure am.
No.
Yeah, hurry up though.
Sure I do.
Okay. Soon? Do you think I'm too fat?
I'm getting a little bit fat. I hate that.
Hey Tits, I'm taking your neighbor to the country. Maybe something for you too.
You want to see him too, right?
Then, shut up!
Nothing.
Is something wrong? What's happened to your face?
You can't just stay out half the night and carry on, Jeffrey. There's got to be some order, Jeffrey. I thought it would have been nice to call your father when you got home but now it is much too late.
Later Mike. I gotta take care of someone who's hurt here, in case you haven't noticed.
Thanks for the tour. It was nice talking to you.
I don't want you to get involved, really, I mean, I do, but if something went wrong I mean, like you said, they may be involved in murder.
OK. It's a strange world, Sandy. This is what I have found out. What I think I have found out. Dorothy Vallens is married to a man named Don. They have a son. I think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named Frank who has now cut off both of Don's ears. I think he is holding them to make her do things for him. I think she wants to die. The ears were for her a warning to stay alive. There is another man involved. I call him the "yellow man". You saw his back the other day in the hall at her door. I don't know what he does but I think he's on drugs supplied by Frank. Frank is a very dangerous man.
I don't see how I can, and I can't prove any of this. I got all this information illegally. Also it could get you in trouble.
Actually. I've been in twice.
Yes.
Yeah. I mean a little, you know.
That doesn't bother you, does it?
That's what I thought.
Why are there people like Frank. Why is there so much trouble in this world?
Yeah I guess so.  You're a neat girl.
I guess so. You want to help me watch Frank? I'm going to stake out Frank's place tomorrow with a camera.
What is it?
No Jeffrey!!
Yeah. I was only twelve or thirteen when you guys used to talk about him, like he was a ghost or something.
Where's your gun?
This is a six-shooter.
Fuck, man! I may as well have posted flyers. Right out in public, man.
This guy is very sharp. If he hasn't figured us out yet, he will.
What... the dirty bitch! I hope ya trounced her a good one!
Fuck!
Ass!
"I'm afraid we can't let that one go, Ivan."
Asshole!? I'm not the rope-totin' Charlie Bronson wanna-be that's getting' us lost!
And he is one smart man.
Can she I.D. them?
Of course they were. How many?
They shot him at a downward angle.  They put him on his knees.
Shit! Shit!
We promise.
You sure you killed them?
You'll make it outta here. You can't ever stop, not ever.
What do you want me to say?
How long since your last confession, my son?
Kind of. Except we've already got the keys.
Would they do that?
Hang on a second.
We got it. We got it.
I know. But once you get inside you're home free.
It's not a plan. It's just --
Yeah, but you wouldn't have the truck if you blew it up.
Don't worry about it, Bob.
Can you hand me those french fries.
That's Applejack. You want to meet him?
Easy, Dignan. It's OK.
Take your second position.
Applejack's stuck in the elevator?
We're not sure yet. It's going to need some repairs.
Technique. That's right. Seventy- five percent of your job is crowd control. Seventy-five percent. Do you believe that?
That sounds like Dignan.
Let them fight.
And if Future Man doesn't get let out of jail in 48 hours, then we go back. All right?
Hopscotch. The code name is hopscotch.
Cuba.
That's your friend Anthony?
What's he doing here?
What are you talking about, Bob?
I'm paying attention. I just want to look at it for a minute.
I just want to see how much bullets it takes.
That's true. That would give me nightmares.
I don't know.
We'll have to see when we get back.
I never agreed to that.
Bullshit.
I think so.
John, I'm twenty-six years old I didn't run away from home.
I'd appreciate it if you didn't go around telling people lies about me.
He's damn good.
She is a good looking woman.
Bourne comes here? Why?
Don't know.
I'm sorry, Ward.
Yes...
Then what?
Conklin.
The Telegraph office.
We pushed it. We got lazy.
Jason. You know exactly what to do. That is your mission now.
Bourne?
And the Germans can't match it?
-- no! -- not me! -- no other people! --
It's got caffeine in it. That's all I know.
It was in Latin, sir.
Homage is nothing. It is the crown that matters!
That is another matter. There is a price to all this, required both by Longshanks and our nobles. Pay it, and you will be our king. And we will have peace.
...His majesty was quite keen that you should understand --
Mornay has come. So will the Bruce.
I could crush you like a roach.
This is what happens when you must send a woman. And a fool.
My greatness is better demonstrated with this.
A magistrate wished to capture him, and found he had a secret lover, so he cut the girl's throat to tempt Wallace to fight -- and fight he did.
I cannot love you for the sake of revenge.
Aye. But it won't let me dream.
When did you ever care about getting to school on time?
I can't help it. I'm just so proud of you. You've got the highest grades in all of your classes.
Please. He got straight A's without ever touching a book. That was the one area where his memory never failed him.
Don't worry. I'm gonna get you out of here.
I can't... the car vanishes and all of a sudden I'm on the ground in the woods.
It's coming... argh! I can't!
What?
He must be. They're letting him go, right?
So it didn't feel... weird?
Nice to see you, too. Can I come in?
Sure, Evan, why not? You were the first person I really ever cared about.
That's why when I was little I never went to live with my mother.
When my folks split, they gave me and Tommy a choice who we wanted to live with. I couldn't stand my dad, but I knew if I moved to my mom's I'd never see you again.
It's crossed my mind from time to time.
Well a lot of things cross my mind. I've always been a fast thinker, Ev. I can play out the movie of our entire lives in under a second. Boom -- we fall in love -- get married -- two kids, your keen analytical insight matched to my generous nature -- kids grow old as do we, relatively stable relationships, matching burial plots, the whole bit. It took a lot longer to spit out than to imagine.
Why not? But that's not how things wound up. I'm with Lenny, Lenny's your friend. And there it ends.
Look, Jason, I need some fast answers if I'm ever gonna fix what I've done.
Thumper had a busy afternoon.
My mom packed for me. I think she sent everything I ever owned. So we'll see.
Sorry, Mrs. T. He's been out of sorts lately.
Yeah, you do that, Lenny.
What is your name?
Yes, sir.
It's certainly not good enough. But since I'm in a hurry, it'll have to do.
You needn't be concerned about me.
I know very little about you, just the fact that you had your teeth straightened.
The stairs from the street.
-- Last night we said a great many things. You said I was to do the thinking for both of us. Well, I've done a lot of it since then and it all adds up to one thing. You're getting on that plane with Victor where you belong.
-- You've got to listen to me. Do you have any idea what you'd have to look forward to if you stayed here? Nine chances out of ten we'd both wind up in a concentration camp. Isn't that true, Louis?
Be careful.
Apparently he has the letters.
But no intention of selling them. One would think if sentiment wouldn't persuade him, money would.
I wasn't sure you were the same. Let's see, the last time we met --
I appreciate it, but I don't accept it.
My friend, you could make it a million francs, or three, my answer would still be the same.
There is. I suggest that you ask your wife.
I said, ask your wife.
No. Please, Monsieur, it is a little game we play. They put it on the bill, I tear the bill up. It is very convenient.
Are you quite finished with us?
I have already heard about this cafe, and also about Mr. Rick himself.
Mademoiselle.
When it comes to women, you're a true democrat.
And got well paid for it on both occasions.
Maybe. Well, it seems you are determined to keep Laszlo here.
Oh, I see. Gestapo spank.
Yeah? Why?
Put it down as a gesture to love.
I do. We've got plenty of time to discuss that later.
Just the same, you call the airport and let me hear you tell them. And remember, this gun's pointed right at your heart.
What is your nationality?
No.
If I gave you any thought, I probably would.
For a price, Ugarte, for a price.
I don't mind a parasite. I object to a cut-rate one.
Who did you bribe for your visa? Renault or yourself?
No, Mr. Richard. I can't find her.
You don't know where you are.  You missed the shipping lanes.
They're on autopilot.
Damn it!  Don't be so negative!
Possible.  So you did those wings?
They're harder to do than they look.
Well, I do a little drawing --
Let's take a look.
You can't go now.
You want to.
You have any children?
I don't know.  I really don't know.
Well, when that IV runs out, you're through with us.  Just the dentist tomorrow.
It's nothing you did, Mom, believe me.
Can you find her?
Right.  Get me everything on Indonesia, New Guinea, all the way to Australia.
To Wilson.
Try to think of nothing, Dorothy.
Wilbur, he picked them for us himself...
Good night, Daddy.
When I'm not thinking about Wally. I'm not good at being alone.  Oh, goodness. You meant... yes, I'm fine. I...  ...I don't suppose you've seen a lobster yet.
Yes... and no. When you come here, you don't really care about the movie.
So we should "wait and see." For how long?
Fine. That's all there is to it then.
Okay, okay--I know you do, too.
She knows how to take care of herself.
I don't want you to walk--I want to carry you. Should I put the top up? It might get cold.
You *bet* it's a heavy sedation! The fetus is unexpelled, her uterus is punctured, she has acute peritonitis, and there's a foreign object. I think it's a crochet hook.
Is that soon?
*And* over the Himalayas. That's called flying over the hump.
I guess so...
One cervical stabilizer, two sets of dilators--Douglas points. One medium- sized curette, one small; one medium speculum, one large; two vulsellum forceps.
I haven't read that.
But isn't Fuzzy just... well, underdeveloped?
It's your heart--you ought to take it with you.
It's just my heart.
That's it.
They told Muddy his feet was too flat!
*You* taught her, I suppose...
The good news, Jack, is you're half- undressed for *swimmin'*...
You're welcome. I was just going to ask you if you'd like to join us.
Gordo plays the inside. You're the Shill.
What are you talking about? You should get a fucking Academy Award for the Shill work you do.  We got it down cold, Al. You don't want to jinx it by changing something up, do you?
Cue the fucking violins. Come on... It's getting cold.
Let's see... Let's suppose he gets to Customs and he gets caught. We get our money back, but then we have to deal with a criminal investigation. I don't much like that idea. Then again, let's suppose he actually gets through Customs. Now, that'll be something. We recover the money in cash and let the insurance cover the corporate fraud. We double our money.
I think so. The airport's going to be crawling with police. Traffic will be a nightmare. Go down to the bar. If they pull it off, great. Have someone deal with Ashby.
And how much did you say you wanted for this... What did you call it? A finder's fee?
So far, masters of our own demise. What bank are you with?
Tonight. Just me.
And all you need to do for your ten percent is put some paperwork through and push a button tomorrow.
You ask a lot of questions. Come on.  Let me see 'em.
Tip was fine, Jake. We were a little more curious about the Fed.
Y-y-you fucking shot him! That's what happened!
Here's my deal -- Don't waste my time. What do you want me for anyway? You don't even know me.
Off the record, I'm this close to cutting someone in on the action if it'd help.
You know why I told you that, Jake?  Because I trust you too.
You sure we're clear?
What?
Good point.
Jake? Customs?
Maybe he's got it right. Maybe we're all just looking for a safe place to shit.
I can handle it.
It's not history.
I want to get out from under all this for good. And I want to fuck them all doing it.
Look Special Agent Moonan... We don't know what you're talking about.
To who?
You think this is a good idea? We never did this kinda shit before.
I despise the job.
I want a job, Giles.
I was thinking perhaps I could be a reader. You employ readers, don't you?
You want me drunk?
It's only hair. I haven't changed.
You were talking in your sleep.
You know where I'm from?
It can only work with amateurs, A pro would have spotted it.
Then you're not a pro.
What for?
Have I?
And what do you do, Lucy?
Are you going to put a spell on me?
That bitch? No.
Has he?
No.
I said good call.
A pleasure. Pity about Bella.
Oh, God...
Boiler, we're alive. My heart.
Can you beat that? I always knew Talby was weird.
I am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes thirty seconds. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
I read you, Lieutenant Doolittle, but I am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
What?
Who cares. Don't bother me.
I like it up here.
I don't like to go below since Commander Powell died. I feel enclosed down there. If it were big enough, I'd sleep up here...
...You see, I can watch things up here, Doolittle. I love to watch things, just stare at the planets and meteors and asteroids, gas clusters...
You know, Doollttle, if we're going into the Veil Nebula, we may actually find a strange and beautiful thing: the Phoenix Asteroids. They should be passing through there about now...
They are a body of asteroids that make a complete circuit of the universe once every 12.3 trillion years. The Phoenix Asteroids... From what I've heard, Doolittle, they glow... glow with all the colors of the rainbow. Nobody knows why. They just glow as they drift around the universe. Imagine all the sights they've seen in the time they've been travelling -- the birth and death of stars, things we'll never see. The universe is alive, Doolittle. I thought it was all empty, but it isn't. In between the stars, it's seething with light and gasses and dust. There are little pebbles drifting around, planets no one on Earth has ever seen... No one but the Phoenix Asteroids...
I'm glad you've come to talk with me, Doolittle. It's been so long since anyone has come to talk with me.
Doolittle, you must tell me one thing.
Tell me, Doolittle, how are the Dodgers doing?
Ah... pity, pity...
Ah, so many malfunctions... why don't you have anything nice to tell me when you activate me? Oh, well, did you try the azimuth clutch?
What was that, Doolittle?
It didn't work?
Sorry, Doolittle. I've forgotten so much since I've been in here. So much.
Well, what you might try is --
Yeah?
Leave.  Now.
No.
No time.
I got overhead...
I don't want to move away.
But why can't we stay here?
Are we in some kind of trouble?
Then how come last night I heard you talking to Logan and you were crying?
Wasn't that hard.
Now you know who I am, where I live.  I figured I better find out who I'm dealing with in case you were looking to hurt me.
Too early to tell.
Lauren's not my wife.
One of my sources.  Her husband was murdered by Edgar Sonrisa.
Fortunately, my needs are met in that department.
Look around at all this...  Built by people who got up every morning and worked hard trying to make a better life.  Then the bomb happened and everyone got scared.  They blinked and before they knew it they'd given away the store to a bunch of thugs who were happy to take it off their hands.  Overnight the government, the police, everything intended to protect the people had been turned against them.
People had a choice, even if they took it for granted.  And now they don't.
Something.
You accept the way things are, you're an active participant in making it worse.
Yeah...
How well do you remember the lab?
How much do you know?
The technical term for you is "chimera"...
A girl.
Hardly...
Ladies would be elsewhere.
He got the car in a trade for his old pick-up and some food...no bill of sale or nothing.  It was right after the pulse so all the DMV records were wiped.  So we don't get anything on the seller.  Except I actually managed to find this guy, six hours on the phone... Say thank you.
He says he got it from a woman.  Doesn't remember her name but she fits the description you gave like a glove.
Got a pencil?
One-seven-four-nine-five Natoma.
What, you gonna put me on your Christmas card list?
We gotta talk.
Theo's dead.
Amanda Finch. Her ex is one of the wealthiest businessmen in Detroit. Play your cards right and you could hit paydirt. She like 'em young.  And since you look a little new at this, let me give you three words of advice. Hard to get. Think it, act it, know it, be it. Nothing a woman loves more than when you beat her at her own head games.
My dad's company is relocating him. We're moving. That's why I was acting so freaky in school today. I thought it was the last time I'd ever see you. Anyway, open the box. I would have given it to you this morning, except... like I said, I was freaking out.
Our band "Mystery" is a quartet and we can't go on the road without our drummer. Jam's mom said something about sending him to St. Bernard's, right? We gotta bust him out before we go anywhere.
Stellas. I hate stellas almost as much as I hate dogs.
Wait a minute. We ditching the rest of school?
Nah. Couldn't be.
It's my Bullworker.
What's gone?
Gone!? Why would I have the KISS tick...?
Christine stole it! Asleep, my ass! The stella booted with your mom's wheels.
If I'm anything like you, I'll deserve him.
I said, I'm sorry!
You're one to talk, Lex. Your mom's a fuckin' dyke.
Simple-icity is more like it. And you guys thought Jam was in trouble before. Wait till Mrs. Bruce finds out he went to that concert with us.
Don't try to run, maggot. Chongo's an all-state track star in every event.
A tag on your toe. Nobody threatens me and lives.
It's not nearly enough, punk.
Donnie. Donnie Darko.
Donnie! Give it back!
Hey...
No. I just wake up and I look around, try to figure out where I am... how I got there.
Maybe she's asleep.
Why? Is this about the book?
Who's Frank?
Do you get to meet Ed?
How does it feel to have a wacko for a son?
Donnie... it's Friday. Shouldn't you be off with your friends, scaring old people?
I don't know. That's a good question... but suffice to say that I am no longer your English teacher. They fired me.
Thank you, Donnie. And you're a good student. Lazy... but a good student. Unlike most of the others, you question Mom and Dad's rules.
Tell them that everything is going to be just fine.  It is up to the children to save themselves these days. Because the parents... they don't have a clue.
No. That makes you keep searching.
Thank you.
Goodbye, Dr. Thurman.
I would like to put him through more hypnotherapy... and increase his medication.
What else?
Let's go to Donnie's house. His parents are both at work.
Really, Loretta?
My mom wanted me to have this?
Loretta, never have kids.
Your parents'd kill you.
Lis, I want to, I really do, but... Oh, I can't.
Yah?
I ain't lettin' go ktil you tell me what's up. I'm reaching' a point where I'd kill someone for the nicotine on their fingernails.
What?!
You heard me. Where is it?
I know.
They told me to practice.
Oh, all right  How soon they forget where all this comes from.
I said I'd move if a cripple came. Let's just run in the store and pick out some outfits.
English! English, you stupid little retard! We America now, Tina!
Tina! Tina!! TINA!!!
Take a letter...
What do I get?
I don't want to buy ammunition -- we no gotta war.
Sure, that's easy.  You gotta insult somebody.
Well, we gotta one hundred thousand men.
That's all right.  We let you have twenty-five thousand men -- and we both start even.
No. Seventy-five -- seventy-five.
We gotta two battalions and one Frenchman.
I've gotta five thousand men but no horses.
That's all right -- our men can ride your horses.
Oh, sure.  We have horse maneuvers every morning.
Tired!  I'd like to stretch this into a week -
You can keep it -- I've got a whole pack...  Now what were you saying?
WHAT  ?
I thought everything was working out fine.
Maybe you can still win the old dame over -- why not try to --
I don't know. I can't explain it. If this is an intelligent man, trapped in the body of a monster, then I'm under a moral obligation to help free that mind, free that spirit as best I can, to help him live as full and content a life as possible. But! If he's an imbecile, who's body I can't treat and who's mind I can't touch, well, then my obligation is discharged. They can put him where they will; he won't be bothered, I won't be bothered, and everyone's conscience can remain free and untroubled. And that is my dilemma... what is in his mind?
I'll show you! I'll show you!
Indeed!
Not me, sir. Mr. Merrick. He succeeded in spite of my shortsightedness.
I am very pleased to meet you.
Oh no, Mr. Merrick. I just work there.
You've never been?
Well you must go. It is one of the most beautiful places on earth. Of course, I'm rather partial.
It's very difficult to put into a nutshell, but I should say the theater is the shrine of the imagination, where one may suspend disbelief and travel anywhere in the world, to any time you desire. You may look over the shoulders of kings, unobserved, battle with ruthless tyrants, and marry the beautiful princess, all in the space of a few hours. Onstage you may be whoever you wish to be, do anything you please, and always, always live happily ever after. The theatre is all the brightest and best things of the world, Mr. Merrick. It is lights and music, gaiety and joy. It's... well, it's romance.
That's one thing the theatre has in great store. which reminds me. I have something else for you...
Good morning.
Oh yes! It is much better than what I am used to.
Your mother?
Oh, Mr. Treves. Mr. Treves.
Mr. Treves. Thank you my... friends.
Perhaps you've got the time for that, Mr. Treves, I certainly don't. I've got an entire hospital to look after, and you have your real patients. Don't waste your time with him sir, it's like talking to a wall. I don't mean to be harsh, but truthfully what can you do for him? I'll be back later for his bath. And Mr. Carr Gomm would like to see you when you have a moment. Good day sir.
Bytes. Mr. Bytes. He'll be there.
Well, EVERYONE is friends here on Hy- Brasil.
I'll bring it back.
No. It's YOU who doesn't understand, Aud. Halfdan has come to kill and destroy. We brought him here. We must stop him.
Goodbye, Aud...
It was my master Keitel's idea.
That's very kind of you, but we're in rather a hurry... We're...
They'll be more than "hurt" if Halfdan the Black lands! Ow!
What a stupid idea.
What's the point of being dead in the land of the living?
Very deep... usually...
Row! Row! Row!
Look out!
To the oars!
But...
It doesn't matter WHERE you sit!
Well, what difference does it make where you're SITTING?
The Dragon...
Mum! Dad!
Well... I... I thought...
I know, Dad.
You went berserk...
So did your father...
But it's a responsibility...
I must only let the red rage...
I KNOW! I'VE HEARD IT ALL 1 THOUSAND TIMES!
Neither am I.
Just a little overworked, maybe.
I can't. I want to, but I have to study.
I really want to, but tonight's important. Test tomorrow.
Why?
Why are you sorry? I just said hi.
I like to read.
Yeah? I can't remember that album very well. I remember liking it. But --
Sort of, um...
What?
Yeah?
I don't know.
Yeah, I don't know. It's hard to know.
Yeah, I guess.
It's helpful to think there's some order to things. You're kind of closed mouthed, aren't you?
Oh.  Does that make you sad? Or anxious? I'm always anxious thinking I'm not living my life to the fullest, y'know? Taking advantage of every possibility? Just making sure that I'm not wasting one second of the little time I have.
No, see, Clem, I assume you fucked someone tonight. Isn't that how you get people to like you?
No. Thanks.
This kid, Joe Early, is going to beat the shit out of me.
I remember that speech really well.
You had the whole human race pegged.
I still thought you were going to save me. Even after that.
It would be different, if we could just give it another go around.
Um, no.
I don't know.
Hey, lover. Whatcha doing?
God, I can't believe I ever hated you.
Guess what I'm wearing.
Your dried cum.
That's your look for me.
Next thing I remember we were walking down near the surf.
In a minute.
Hi.
Well, what should we do?
Sor-ry  We have to do something. He can't wake up half done.
Thanks, Mary. You can bring her in.
I don't know what I'm supposed say, Mary. I want to do the right thing here.
I have a family, Mary.
It was a mutual decision.
I didn't make you. You thought it best.  But, look, I take full responsibility.
Hi, I was in the neighborhood and thought I'd see --
Would you just try him? You never know. As long as I'm here. You never know.
Thanks, Stan. I owe you.
Easy come, easy go.
Really? The Chink, huh? I've gathered that you sometimes speak with him. What else have you learned from the Chink?
Getting dressed. I've got to go.
I have to go, Julian.
My thumbs hurt. I've made a mistake. I've been negligent. I haven't exercised. I have to hitchhike a little bit every day, no matter what. It's like a musician practicing his scales. When I don't practice, my timing gets off, my thumbs get stiff and sore.
Why, yes, technically. Jack Kerouac and I came awfully close, but he was afraid of me, I think...
What makes you think this watercolorist and I would develop a romantic relationship?
Well, okay. I'll try it. I don't see the point in it, but I'll try it. Just for you. It's kind of silly, actually, me going out with an artist in New York City. However...
EVERYBODY SHUT UP! Let the man speak.
Smith, clear that airlock, man, I'm coming in.
Run!
It's not a distress call. It's a warning.
I wouldn't bring you here on a hoax. Houston confirms the telemetry and I.D. codes.
We still have pressure. The radiation count's steady at 7 millirads an hour.
Just loading the last of the CO2 scrubbers.  Good for four months.
No, no, its alright. I talked to my ex, he'll keep Denny over Christmas and I'll get him this summer.  Goddam it, Skipper... I haven't seen him in two months.
...how's the client?
Smith, use the arm and lock us onto that antennae cluster.
"Insane?" The finest astronauts fought to be posted to this ship. It would take the Lewis and Clark a thousand years to reach our closest star. The Event Horizon could be there in a day...
If it worked, yes.
You can't, your orders are specific...
You're insane. You've lost your mind.
Don't... don't do this...
Locked and cocked.
Starck, give me a read.
No, no, we just got her back together...
How much oh-two do we have?
Carbon dioxide?
We can take the filters from the Clark...
What about the life readings you picked up?
What's causing the readings?
So where is the rest of the crew? We've been over every inch of this ship and all we've found is blood. Dr. Weir? Any suggestions?
He's awake, he's in the airlock, he's not wearing a suit.
He's been past Mars?
Wasn't that ship destroyed?
Come on, Baby-bear, open this door...
Thank you for that scientific analysis, Mister Smith.
I don't think this is a good idea, we don't even know what happened on that ship...
It wants me. I have to go.
"Sensual blind chick seeks three- ton, rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship."
Victor must've taken him.
Deb, it's me. It's still me.
He's made a few changes.
Victor's better at these things.
If we're going to identify the source of the mutation, we need to isolate your recombinant DNA so we can activate positional genomes.
Back on Earth. Victor's medical facility... We're in quarantine.
They're fine. Everybody else... is fine.
So are you!
I've never felt better in my life. When do you get off work?
Meet me at 4:01, top of the run. That'll give you a minute to freshen up.
This place is deluxe. You got cable?
Johnny.
Look around, sis! She's not here. So you can stop talking to me like I'm your little boy --
That's why. Because I could have any other woman... You know, when they asked Caesar "why England," he said, "because it's not mine."
You are such a dork, Reed... You never got it and never will unless it's explained to you in quantum physics.
Are you kidding?
You were?
Hilarious.
I think you both know my Director of Genetic Research, Susan Storm.
Then why is Reed dragging his feet? Maybe he likes having his prize specimen under glass...  It's ironic, isn't it? You're finally the perfect woman for him... because you're his science project.
Come on, Spicoli. Why don't you just put your shirts back on? See the sign?
U.S. History. Mr. Hand.
No.
O-kay, you guys can come swimming. But you have to leave as soon as my Mom gets home. Okay?
You first.
All right. All right. I just cleaned B-8. Give me a break.
Damone. It's Mark.
It's happening right now. I'm here at the Atlantis. Everything's fine except... I left my wallet at home.
No. It's too late. The food is coming and everything. Damone, I've got to ask you this favor, and I'll never ask you for anything again in this lifetime or any other. Will you please borrow your mom's car, go by my house, get my wallet, and meet me back here?
Yes.
Naw. Any good?
All right.
Really?
He was hot, wasn't he?
Stacy. What does it matter? He's a stereo salesman. You want to marry him? You want to have kids with him? You want this guy to come home, fifty years old, and he's still got that little Pacific Stereo badge on? Come on.
I don't know, I'm just so depressed. Everything is just so... depressing.
Yes.
Aloha, Spicoli.
We keep them.
We keep them, in case the people come back.
Two more Cokes.
Hi, Stacy. How are you?
Look. That telegram was all scrambled. It was actually from Thompson, not to him. Western Union must have gotten the names reversed. I have to get going. I have to get out to the track.
Not for me.
Naked.
Wait a minute! Come back and have a beer!
You scurvy shyster bastard! Watch your language! You're talking to a Doctor of Journalism!
Pay no attention to this swine. He can't handle the medicine. 
I think he's lying to us. I could see it in his eyes.
You drive! I think there's something wrong with me.
Are you ready?
That's good. You can't be subtle in this town.
Maybe we should take it easy tonight.
It's gone too far.
Two glasses of ice water with ice.
You're damn right. But the first time you say anything about this, to anybody -- you'll go straight to prison for the rest of your life. What's your name?
One phone call every day. Just tell us what you've seen. Don't worry if it doesn't add up, that's our problem.
They'll be back.
Gonna stay for a couple?
Well, your last words can be "I told you so."
In the corner, behind the curtain.
You weren't helpin'.
Uh, uh, I think if we can get everyone into it... we can get out of here.
Sure.
How much I got, what?
Get outta here.
Clear!
MOVE YOUR ASS!
Everyone take a role. Let's prepare the guns, ammo and whatever else we can scare up. We also need to help the hurt so we can move them on our ultimate exit outta here.  So, who's going into the basement with me?
So we've got guns, kitchen knives, pipes, fire and sticks.
All right.
I'm sure it wasn't me, it wasn't me...
I don't know who she fucked to get where she is, but I don't think it was me.
Yup. Claire... please, please tell Mr. Bebe that if he worried half as much about his scripts as he does about my private life, we'd make a lot better movies.
I know.  'This is a factory and we each have our jobs. The writer writes, the director directs, and the actress...'
What?! Good Lord no, it's just... It's money. We needed backing and... well, we found it.
An actress.
Yes. That's the deal. She plays Lorna.
I know, but --
Right now we have to be practical.
He knows, Frances.
Listen to yourself, Frances. The resistance, the anger in your voice.
Be patient, that's all. Take an interest in your treatment and don't dwell on your resentments. You'll be yourself again, I assure you.
We'll talk more about this. I'll see you later.
You really want to go?
And you think it's worth all this?
...Then go.
I have a right to talk to her. She's my daughter, and she's beginning to understand why I've sacrificed so much in order to achieve...
They need help, Lil. They pay me back in other ways.
No, Lil. It's just you can't understand their brand of patriotism.
You're wasting your time, lady. Nothing's off the record with me.
Me? Look at you! What're you doing in Hollywood?
Jesus, Frances, how'd you find me?
Calm down, Frances.
Couple hours from Idaho. We'll cut across to Montana. I've got friends there with a ranch.
What?
That's right.
I love you too, Frances.
Wherever they're going, I'm going.
Well, I was picking fruit with some migrant workers until...
Your big speech?
I already have.
Why are these all opened?
Then why did you bring them?
You kill me, Mama.
Go on...
I told him to come up! I told him you wanted to show them all that there's nothing wrong with you any more, that you're completely cured!
You... you selfish, selfish child. At least talk to him, hear what he has to say.
You want to throw it all away, is that it? You had everything, little sister. Beauty... a brilliant career... a wonderful husband. You were a movie star!
And now you're throwing everything away? You're gonna be a nobody! Nobody! You know what that's like?!
Among persons such as yourself, creative people under great stress, erratic behavior is not at all uncommon and certainly nothing to be ashamed of. It's just that the neuroses which fuel your talent can also generate certain character disabilities which... 
Yeah?
You're kidding.
What?
There was something at work in my soul which I do not understand.
Materials. Nothing more.
Quite right!
Nothing can. Not ever.
Not as weak as I.
It wouldn't dare.
Can you think of a better reason?
Do me a favor then...  ...keep them to yourself.
A... week?
Is that your diagnosis?
You've been going round-the-clock?
Everything in moderation, Clerval.
Despite the lack of challenge.
Madness?
Give them a little while longer. It's still early, anyway.
I'm not sure I'll last all week.  I'll tell Steve.
Slipped in. Probably liked the scent of your perfume.
Wet. I don't know.
Come on, Claudette. A man's not made of stone.
I need you so much, Claudette.
Where's Ned?
Coach, athletic director somewhere.
Just a little. Wait a minute, woman.
They'll be okay if they know enough to stay in outta the rain.
One night on the town.
...I know what you mean. Two and a quarter. Plus fifteen percent tip to make up for me spending the night alone.
You can't, but fifteen percent instead of thirty for my stay at El Ray is a good start.
Jesus Christ, Carlos, my brother's dead and he's not coming back, and it's all your fault. Twenty.
To keep the daylight out! This is where they sleep! Get to the door!
Fair enough. You break your word, I'll kill all of you.  Kate, honey!
Forever together.
That's very nice of Ted, but I'll call him tomorrow and tell him not to bother waiting.
Not enough to be a pastor. Look, I know this is hard on you kids. After Jenny's death, this is probably the last thing you need. But I can't do it any longer. My congregation needs spiritual leadership. Well, they can't get that from me anymore. My faith is gone. To answer your question, yes, I do believe in Jesus. But do I love them? No. After Jenny died, I just thought, what's the point?
I didn't say fuck him. I'm just not connected anymore.
Kate, give your old man a little credit. Every person who chooses the service of God as their life's work has something in common. I don't care if you're a preacher, a priest, a nun, a rabbi or a Buddhist monk. Many, many times during your life you'll look at your reflection in the mirror and ask yourself, am I a fool? We've all done it. I'm not going through a lapse. What I've experienced is closer to awakening. I'm not trying to shake your faith. I've just decided not to devote my life to God anymore.
Mom's got nothing to say, she's dead.
Where are you taking us?
What's in Mexico?
Not many.
Letting him use your toilet? No store does that.
I want that son-of-a-bitch out outta here, in his car, and down the road or you can change the name of this place to "Benny's World of Blood."
When I count three, shoot out the bottles behind him!
One... Two... Three.
She's in the other room.
They broke when you fell.
Don't worry about it, we'll get you some glasses.
When we get to El Ray, I'll take care of it.
It's not a big deal, unless you make it a big deal. Now, I'm real happy, Richie, stop bringing me down with bullshit.
That's what I hear.
Who's "we"?
If you were like everyone else, lieutenant, I suspect we wouldn't be making statements about not making statements, would we?  Take your leave.
I find this as distasteful as you, lieutenant.  But if it's on my desk, it's on my shoulders.  There's going to be an inquiry -- it will not be quick and it will definitely not be pretty.  You should prepare yourself.
I don't see how, O'Neil.  Dismissed.
I'll act surprised.
Lieutenant Thomas Wickwire.
Fuck.  Basher-Basher, this is Ground Crew Six requesting emergency extraction. Stand by for a PRC fix...
Not doin' them very fine, O'Neil.
You'll try what we tell you to try, O'Neil.  Go regulation.
Royce.  We're the same age, we started the same time -- and now you're sitting in the upperdecks while I'm still down in the bullpen. What does that tell you about the Navy?
You need operational duty to really advance... you need combat training to go operational... yet combat training is off-limits to people with tits.  I'm topped out at Intel. Forget the glass ceiling -- I'm beating my head on a big brass ceiling.
This has nothing to do with you.
Get your dick back here.  It has everything to do with you.
Sorry.  But after our days...  So if I try this thing... if I ship out to Coronado... what happens here?
Wai', wait.  What happens if it works?  Four months of training, three years of operational duty. What then?
Which is guy-speak for...
You know, right up until you said that -- I thought I did know.
You don't crap out of Spec-Recon and get another shot without dispensation from someone up in flag country.  He's got a Sea Daddy somewhere.
Yeah.  Me too.
This is insane.  You've got no proof.
It also seems like a problem with the men's attitude, sir.  So maybe you should be sniffing around their shower room instead.
Shut up, sir.  I'm concentrating.
Somebody throw a tent over this circus.
You know how I spent last weekend? Walking his damned dog.
Lucy'd kill me if she knew.
What?
I know a way. I know how you can get a message out of here.
Nick Tatopoulos.
Ah, Elsie Chapman, paleontologist.
Christ. How many tunnels lead off the island?
Have them sealed off.
Fill them with cement, brick them up, put land mines in them, bombs, I don't know, just make sure that goddamned thing doesn't leave the island!
It happened so fast no one knew what hit them 'til is was over.
Thanks.
Good idea.
Quellek. What are you doing in there?
Come with me. I'll explain on the way.
Like throwing gasoline on a fire...
I was staying in character.  "Egomaniacal sonofabitch?"
I had the shot...
Shut up.
You think you could do better "Laredo?"
FRONT ARMOR IS GONE! JUST SLOW IT DOWN A LITTLE!
Excuse me guys.
Lt. Madison, GO.
GO Commander.
All systems are working, Commander.
I don't like this... I don't like this at all...
Let's get out of here before one of those things kills guy.
Hey. Thanks for one nice intro... uh.
One minute   I'm -  Hey, I'm dressing.'
Computer, can it be repaired?
Turn on the translation circuit.
Almost as much as he loves himself.
Better than my Lieutenant.  He failed to activate ship's neutron armor as quickly as I'd hoped on our last encounter.
Mind If we skip that?  I have to get back pretty quick for this thing in Van Nuys.
You what?.. What are you talking about?
Just GO! GO! DAMMIT PUNCH GO!
Jason? What about me? What do I do?
Hmmm... she's beneath me, I'm afraid.
Don't do anything rash, please, Benedict.
Cut those men down.  Congress is pushing ahead with your court-martial.  Benedict, trust me to handle this.
More than that, sir... my orders from Congress.
It's a wonder they find the British cause worth dying for.
To hell with Arnold...
Is this a coup?  Alexander, are you trying to tell me that I might be assassinated if I don't agree?
Lafayette is a child!
We already have black soldiers in our army...
What's the difference?
Well, I shall deny him to you!  He is evil on earth!
General Lee, sir!
Virginia is outraged with your order allowing Negroes to fight in the army.  There's a deep feeling of hurt and betrayal.  They wanted you commander because they expected you would look out for our interests.
Oh, indeed?  You know very well people are frightened of arming the Negroes!  They beg you to consider the future.  What good is a revolution if it overturns those things we cherish!?
Some things must never change.
Don't condescend to me!  We have both of us prospered from the arrangements of our kind...
You have a free tongue, Captain Hamilton.
I remember a pair of young philosophers once, who laughed at the world.
Really?  Which precious homily was it?
It's the freest land on earth.
Well, we must be who we must be...
Though, sometimes we get frost and that can cut the season.
I can't. I got to take Farrah to Satan's place down in Costa Mesa.
Her mother. Not that it matters because I don't work for you no more. I quit. I just wanted to come by, tell you to your face so there's no misunderstanding.
Into air bags. There's no cushion under what you're doing. I'm out of it, Cat. I'm done.
That's your problem. You shouldn't've smoked the guy.
So you didn't have the key with you.
You spotted them, huh?
You can talk to me.
Tell you what...
You must be makin' some big deals, doin' lunch in a place like this?
Yeah, I hear you bagged Martin Weir for Mr. Lovejoy.
I'm already in town, but it don't matter. We got dick in the bank. We dumped it all in Harry's movie.
Ray Barboni. From Miami.
You look okay to me, Harry. Come over here and sit down. Tell me what you been up to.
Well, since Leo's name was on the passenger list...
Martin Weir. He played the mob guy that turned snitch in "The Cyclone".
No, his best part was the cripple gay guy that climbed Mt. Whitney.
Get the fuck outta my chair.
'E.g.' means 'for example', Ray. I think what you wanna say is 'i.e.'
Ask your man here.
It's not that simple. You have to be careful. There's another guy that comes along, a hard-on you owe some money to. A mob guy. Wants to take you out anyway, on account of a past situation.
You see a black leather jacket, fingertip length, like the one Pacino wore in Serpico? You don't, you owe me three seventy-nine.
I just caught the end.
How 'bout Get Shorty? Except that isn't a movie. That's real life.
That's a different story. I'm still working on that one, you know, getting the visual fabric just right.  Although I've added to it.
Guy's got a fucking pink toilet, for Christ's sake.
Don't say a fuckin' word.
You seem to feel fine about it.
Murray's dead.
'We?'
North Island, I wish to declare myself salvor-in-posession under section four two charlie of the International Maritime Convention.
A passenger liner. Over.
Sixty pounds.
That's what it says.
Maybe you shoulda thought a that before you scuttled our boat.
Supposing one of those cables breaks under tow.
So we kill him?
Are you kidding me? Jealous? Epps? Gimme a break.
What, you think there's something funny about it?
And what do you propose? That we knock this guy off?
How do you mean?
I guess the best strategy's just to tell them the truth.
What do you propose?
There's a charming thought.
Maybe six feet. Lanky. I didn't get a good look. He was far away. But I saw him. I saw him as sure as you're standing there.
Yeah. Thanks.
Yup.
Collision? With what?
But where's the damage?
If it was a ship she hit.
Epps, over.
Of course they did.
What do you say, Dodge?
So we cut her loose and wait it out. A little weather couldn't be anything she hasn't seen before.
Moving to Sweden.
We heard you scream. Any idea what you might've seen?
Whyn't you mind your own business, chief.
Nothing.
I uh... I feel that I need to uh -- there's something I feel I have to say... I uh, I've never said this to anyone before -- believe me, I've stayed in horrible relationships for years just so I wouldn't have to do this, but I uh...
It's just that I feel like it's maybe not a good idea for us to keep going out.
What? I'm just kidding around with the customers... It's my shtick!
But I feel weird... it's so sleazy.
Jesus...
Hi.
Yeah, well... hi...
Unless they're in your Summer school class!
Uh oh... don't turn around...
Forget it...
God, it's so totally pathetic.
What a little hosebag.
I can't believe it!
Gross!
Ew, it's like some gross rat...
JOSH!
Where did you get that?
Where?
No way... when?
You cunt!
I can't, it's Seymour's birthday...  Shit! What time is it?  I have to go to the store! I was going to make him a cake...
Yeah, I guess... call me...
That's all you're bringing?
What time?
Make sure you're here by noon - we have tons of stuff to do... Oh yeah! I have to show you something else!
Shhh!
Oh yeah, like he even noticed.
You're late, asshole.
Did you bring that tape?
So you really liked it? Yeah, there's some really rare performances. You liked that Memphis Minnie, huh?
The Skip James record? Yeah, that's a masterpiece. There are no other records like that! I actually have the original 78 of it in my collection. It's one of maybe five known copies.
Do you want to see it? I can run upstairs and get it...
Watch my stuff.
Shh!
What?... Oh that... I borrowed that from work about fifteen years ago... I guess it's mine now.
Yeah, right, I'm a klansman - thanks a lot!... Do you know the Cook's Chicken franchise?
Yeah, well "Cook's" is just a made up name. When they originally opened back in 1922 they were named "The Coon Chicken Inn" -- that's an early painting of their first logo.
YAAA!
That's great! "Half-empty" - that's what I like about you, Seymour, you're a natural pessimist!
What are you talking about? You're disappointed every minute of your life.
At least you're not like every other stupid guy in the world - all they care about are guitars and sports... they're all such fags!
How come in all that time I was trying to get you a date, you never asked me out?
Yeah, but still... it's kind of insulting for a girl to be ignored like that.
I dunno... I always feel like everybody secretly hates me. I'm just paranoid I guess. I mean, you like me don't you? We're good friends, right?
...Maybe I should just move in here with you... I could do all the cooking and dust your record collection and stuff until I get a job.
Oh yeah... and Dana...  You were a lot more fun before you met Dana. You've been acting way too normal lately... you're a bitter, twisted, fucked-up guy, Seymour, that's why I like you.
I wish I could see him.
-you do not call me a liar- you know nothing of their health- consider yourself fortunate I persuaded so many to stay- consider yourself fortunate I have decided to stay-
How could it be? I hate Africa.
-not a time for modesty, Bob-
I am desperate to see Africa- but I hate the leaving.
Well, he put me in a spot, didn't he? But that's all right- after all, I'm responsible for everything that happens here. And it certainly won't do much for morale if a man-eater's on the prowl.
-far end of camp- man wandering alone at night. Hawthorne's examining the body now.  There's even less of him than of Singh.
You just got hit.  The getting up is up to you- but they're only lions-  -and I'm going after them crack of dawn... 
This is more difficult-
Once... 
You know, you are really doing very good work here.  I think soon you may be ready to assist me in some of the more important restorations.
Okay, whatever you think -- but not Venkman.
Do you ever see him?
How is he these days?
Does he ever mention me?
Okay, let's take a look.
Really?  And how would we handle the sleeping arrangements?
How about you on the sofa and me in bed with the baby.
Thank you.  Poor baby.  I think I should put him down now.
A little to the left.  Right there!  That's where it stopped.
Ghostbusters.
Too bad for the Moldavians.
Sorry, your Honor, but when somebody sets me up like that I can't resist.
I thought you were like the fifth Ghostbuster.
A hundred and five years?  He really hung on, didn't he.
His nickname is "The Hammer."
I'd put my money on that Vigo character.
Okay, let's heat 'em up!
You just picked up three penalty points on your driver's license.
The whole city's together on this one.  We took a vote.  Everybody's down on you, you know.
Huh?  What?
What?  Yeah.
No, I'm fine.  I just got light-headed for a second there.  Let's go.
And decent.
Do you think I have it, Dr. Venkman?
It's in the stars.
You heard it?
Most people can't hear me with the whole orchestra playing.  You're good.
I know.  You're quite a celebrity these days.  Are you here because you have info ... about my case?
The "stiff?"  He happens to be one of the finest musicians in the world and a wonderful man.
Yeah, it's some kind of mallow-type substance - that's for sure.
I wonder if there might not be a very large cup of hot chocolate somewhere in the area.
Has this ever happened before?
Did you ever report it to anyone?
Yes, sir.  Don't worry.  We handle this kind of thing all the time.
Yes.  I don't like this.
Two wavy lines?
Yeah, I can smell it.
Or even a race memory, stored in the collective unconscious.  And I wouldn't rule out clairvoyance or telepathic contact either.
Peter, at 1:40 this afternoon at the main branch of the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue, ten people witnessed a free-roaming, vaporous, full-torso apparition.  It blew books from shelves at twenty feet away.  Scared the socks off some poor librarian.
No, this one's for real, Peter.  Spengler went down there and took some PKE readings. Right off the top of the scale.  Buried the needle.  We're close this time. I can feel it.
This might do ... I don't know ... it just seems kind of "pricey" for a fixer-upper, don't you think?  We're trying to keep our costs down.  You know how it is when you're starting a new company.
It's not good, Pete.
LATER, MAN!!
I want every single thing that belonged to my father out of this house!  If it's worth something then sell it!
You would have had a full scale revolt on your hands.
Cooperate and they will be returned to your estate.  I could have executed you.
I'm certain father will be in better humors by then.  Now, honor us with your presence at dinner.  I'll join you as soon as I see my father's physician.
This is Cos, this precocious young man.  A scribe for the Daily Action.  I've invited him to write a small piece about you...
The moment you returned from the battle your options were clear.  If you are a friend to neither side, legate, you must be an enemy to both.  We needed to know what you believed.
Do you remember your Epictetus, that little homily we recited when we were children?  The one that was supposed to remind us we were Romans?
What the hell do you think it was about?  There's nothing an unproved heir to the throne likes less than glaring competence in others.
Well, we can try...
I can see that...
If you win, you know, you have to stay.  It's the losers who get to go home.  Besides, I'm not so sure it is over.  Centurions report enemy scouts probing our lines.
Chain him.
So I pretend I'm dead.  You get gold, what do I get?
As, what, 'The Galloping Gladiator?!'
Spend my days beheading country bumpkins?  I don't know, Proximo, who has better wine than you? Besides, I'm beginning to think of the Colosseum as my home.
Pressures on, eh Proximo?  There's got to be a load of money in this. Why else would you toss a red hot commodity like me out the window?
No.
If it's all right with you, I'm not hungry.
Of course there is. Look -- The Veranda Room -- right there.
Oh my God --
Because it isn't true.
What?
No.
Maybe we are and maybe we aren't.
What?
Oh -- no sir.
Will you bring it in to me?
All right. Put it in the room where we were.
Is what a girl?
Oh -- no. I'm just sort of disturbed about things.
That's right.
Yes.
I'm very neurotic.
Where is it?
What?
I haven't. No.
Well -- I don't. I mean I could. Or we could just talk.
You? Oh no. No. I'll get it.
Now?
Well -- I don't know.
Why don't I get it? Well -- I will then.  If you'll excuse me.
No. Think of another topic. Tell me what you did today.
Yes I do.
Don't talk about Elaine?
Why not?
Benjamin -- I thought I made myself perfectly clear about this.
But I am. I'm extremely upset about it, Benjamin.
Yes, but I'm afraid --
No -- actually I'm just looking for a friend.
I'm not with your party -- I'm sorry.
Oh, Ben -- this is so -- exciting --
Swell. I appreciate it.
Standing guard over the old castle, are you?
Mrs. Robinson?
It's Benjamin.
Benjamin Braddock.
Can you look through the glass.
Oh yes -- that's right -- look! I win, don't I -- 
You can't.
What about the money?
How?
You might find a bullet through that head...
Looking for my room -- one sixty- six.
For tonight. 
Yes -- oh!
And Baron, thanks so much for everything.
Oh -- 
Oh -- Doctor -- you are a Doctor -- I am --
No -- not at all.
All right then.
Insolent -- Berlin manners.
Your chauffeur's been waiting, Baron.
For me? -- Oh, please, something sweet and cold.
Oh, don't go.
Oh, can anyone engage you for the evening?
Oh, there must be one in Paris... They have everything in Paris.
Perhaps. 
I had to arrange about the trip.
You think so?
Oh -- now let's talk like adults. You want to tell us now a along story of what your factory can do. We know all that you could tell us and if you tell the truth it wouldn't sound so good. When you first approached us...
I've admitted that at one time we had reason for desiring ther merger -- What reason have we now? The Preysing Company has fallon upon evil days, very evil days.
Send it away -- I shan't need it.
I wish to be alone.
I don't know you.
Terrible. After this, no more ballets for me. Jazz --  Just jazz.
When she gets her paint on and hears the music -- she'll be all right. I know these people.
You work for me, huh? Then I just may flush you down the toilet. Drive me to the Durando.
Oh, well, you know. I just clip a buck here and a buck there. Not enough to notice.
A person that don't look out for himself is too dumb to look out for anybody else. He's a liability, right, Bobo?
Or else he's working an angle. If he doesn't steal a little, he's steeling big.
You know, I like that suit, Bobo. I don't know what there is about it, but it somehow makes you look taller.
Well, you can tell them I said they're right.  I better get going. Roy'll wonder where I am.
I will. So long, Bobo.
So here we are!
What? He's going to be all right!
Well, make it stop!
You know who I work for.
So I heard.
Just myself.
Just a little accident. I went by your place, picked up your mall. Just bills, I'll take care of them.
Whatever you say. The manager says your boss called.  Really pulled the wool over everybody's eyes, huh?
Stop kidding me! Four years in a town like Los Ang-gleez, and a peanut selling job is the best you can do? You expect me to believe that?
And that dump you live in! Those clown pictures on the walls!
We won't hit the track. The beach. Couple a nice restaurants.
Don't be sorry. You're not taking it.
What?
Taking you for granite?
We'll rent a car.
Separate bathrooms, darling. I will not lay out all my cosmetics for you to knock over.
You don't mind, really, do you, Roy? It's been such a wonderful evening, I guess I just wore myself out.
Yes?
Thank you.
That don't match either of the victim's.
Toni Blake from Langley P.D.
You sure?
Nothing's missing?
My office?
I was trying to get away from someone.
I came to see you.
Can I come in?
Then you come out here.
Well, I'm not going until I talk to you.
What?
You're right.  It does sound strange.
He gave me a fuckin' A?  Wow.
Shit, Beth, why do we have to be the ones to organnize this friggin' fair? It's only Halloween.
Okay ... But just for tonight.
What makes you think he'll come here again?
Jamie?  But I thought she was --
It's a rune ... Thorn.
You should know that it's not wise to play Halloween pranks on me.
This is madness, Wynn.
It was you.
Why did you take Jamie?
Jamie's baby ...
Samhain.
Home.  Jesus.  I'm like this.  Home!
You know what gets me?
How all the magazines show tits today.
Used to be against the law, didn't it?
Must have changed that law.
You know me, boy.
I'd rather go to Viet Nam.
What you say is, "Pass the fucking catsup."
Mhravitch.
When I grow up, I'm going to go to Mhravitch.
Sir?
I wanted to go out for football, but Mom was afraid I'd get hurt.
Dr. Woodly says he's seen hundreds of children permanently injured by football.  He says that when there's a war, everybody goes but football players.
They're not engaged.
Oh no, no, no, no, no.  It can't be. How embarrassing.
No, no, no, no, no.
Go ahead.  No, no, no, no.
What's this?
You'd better get Dr. Woodly.
Turn around?
You feel I've done a dreadful thing--leaving him?
Ah!  The lady is armed.
Whoever has the gun, you see, gets to tell everybody else exactly what to do.  It's the American way.
Then you'd better fix your bayonet, because there aren't any bullets in the gun.
We'll miss you so.
Oh, oh, oh--I thought it was your apartment.  You seemed at home here.
I was going to ask.
Would you say that again?
I've never heard of it.
Are you've seen it work cures?
Comical?
Jesus.
No, no--shit no.  Excuse me, Penelope.
For saying "shit." Or is that okay now?
My mother-in-law.  Fire engines, pulmotors, doctors, cops, coroners--
Well--I walked up to the front door. I was still alive.  Big surprise. I rang the doorbell, and old Mrs. Wheeler answered.  She had her Goddamn knitting.  I said, "Guess who?" She conked right out.
Yeah--cripes.  I never did get any sense out of Alice.  She found me holding up the old lady, dead as a mackerel.  It was a bitch.  You know--maybe Mrs. Wheeler was going to die then and there anyway, even if I'd been the paper boy.  Maybe not.  I dunno, boy.  That's civilian life for you.  Who knows what kills anybody?
I don't want to live any more.
I'll kill myself.
Shivers and sweats and groans.  His teeth chatter.  What'll we do?
He can hardly talk.
Something happens to my confidence.
When Harold is definitely out of the picture, Penelope, when I don't have to worry about doing him wrong or you wrong or Paul wrong.  I'm going to ask you to be my wife.
That's when I'll get my confidence back.
If you'll pardon the expression, that's when you'll see the fur and feathers fly.  Good night.
Would you like to say something about killing, Colonel?
It's really that bad?
What a beautiful demonstration this is of the utter necessity of rites of passage.
Well, I want to...
I tried to get more, but this is the limit. The De Vries line has the same area.
Something like that. How much do you make?
Three hundred?
I'll give you $700 a week, cash, if you help me find this girl.
Half now, half later.
Okay. My client pays for it anyway.
Tonight. When you get out, we'll go.  Why didn't you tell the other detective?
Fuck.
No, please go on.
Tod gave me the slip. I have to find him again. Where does he live?
Where is he?
Get out. Get out of here, Goddammit.
Yeah. She's quite upset. I'm going to fly out today. They want me to bring some pictures.
I want to know where my daughter is. Her name is Kristen, or Joanne. She's with you.
My secretary said you wanted to discuss a business proposition.
Film making can be pretty expensive...
My name ain't Niki. It's Pattica, like in Attica.
Who's that?
Well, he can just fuck himself.
Yes. Those little pieces of paper with your picture on it?
Oh, I don't have one.
I don't have one. I don't believe in them.
About forty-five minutes, wouldn't you say, Harold? We were hoping to start sooner but, you see, it's rather hard to find a truck.
I just don't think we have one, unless it's in the glove compartment. Could you look, Harold?
No, no. I just took it.
Yes. You see I have to plant my tree.
Well, it's not really mine. I dug it up in front of the courthouse. We're transplanting it. Letting it breathe, you know. But, of course, we would like to get it into soil, as soon as possible.
All right, then, and we'll be off.  Nice chatting with you.
What?... Oh yes... Shovel... Create ... Verily these issues lie in the lap of the gods... Iliad... Just sit down for a minute.
Maude???!
Because they are all the same.
My umbrella?  Oh, that's just a relic. I found it when I was packing to come to America. It used to be my defense on picket lines and rallies and political meetings - being dragged off by police or attacked by thugs of the opposition.  A long time ago.
Oh, Big Issues. Liberty. Rights. Justice. Kings died and kingdoms fell. I don't regret the kingdoms - what sense in borders and nations and patriotism - but I do miss the kings. When I was a little girl I was taken to the palace in Vienna, to a garden party. I can still see the sunshine, the parasols, and the flashing uniforms of the young officers. I thought then I would marry a soldier.  Later, Frederick would chide me about it.  He was so serious. A doctor at the University. And in the government.
Yes, so do I. But I think he is a little... old-fashioned. Like a puff, Harold?
It's all right.  It's organic.
Vice? Virtue? It's best not to be too moral. You cheat yourself out of too much life. Aim above morality. As Confucius says, "Don't simply be good. Make good things happen."
Well --  - they say he was very wise, so I'm sure he must have.
Me!  When I look around me I know I know nothing. I remember though, once long ago in Persia, we met a wise man in the bazaar. He was a professional and used to sell his wisdom to anyone willing to pay. His specialty for tourists was a maxim engraved on the head of a pin. "The wisest," he said, "the truest, the most instructive words for all men at all times." Frederick bought one for me and back at the hotel I peered through a magnifying glass to read the words - "And this too shall pass away."  Well, the wise man was right - if you remember that, you can't help but live life fully.
What was that?
How ingenious! Tell me about them.
Of course.
Traitor! Benedict Arnold! Remember Nathan Hale, right, sir?
You've never cried before. I never thought you would. I thought, despite anything, you could always be happy.
At a funeral.
I don't care what people say.
Does that worry you?
Why?
Ah, yes.
I'm sure. But what else do you do with your time? Do you go to school?
What about the draft?
Oh. Well, how do you spend your day?
Yes. What kind of things do you do?
Oh, sure. A variety of weapons.
Oh sure.
Yes.
Eh?
Well, I don't...
Harold, I think you're getting carried away here.
Souvenirs?
Harold!
No more delays, Kirsty. No more teasing. Time to play.
I'm a girl who keeps her promises.
The Boxes. In the House. I told you.
The boxes! I TOLD you.
Yeah. The things you were talking about.
You were ALL human!
Nothing psychic about it. You're easy.
See? I don't like that --
No. It's not.
Oh, as opposed to -- ?
Hold on -- hold on -- I thought we checked this place. Fakes, and reproductions.
I can live with that.
Oh-n-no -- I --
"Need" is a good, solid word.
Start in, you got nachos coming.
I've changed my mind. I'll come to Moscow. If you -- are still going --
-- Late. Five minutes late.
-- Section fifty-one. Step back.
Two steps back, please.
Julia's my second wife.
Damn right. Now are we going to move the bed or not?
You can keep them.
Don't mourn him. He was dead long before we laid a finger on him.
Ssh!
I don't.
I said no.
The best part of ten years.
It looks like a bomb's dropped.
O.K.
What?
Not much.
Maybe I will.
No Dad.
YOU'D like my room.
Sure.
I thought we'd lost you.
Just go. PLEASE. I'll be O.K. I'm going to go see Dad. He'll look after me --
Will you GO, damn you?
Rob.  Top five musical crimes perpetrated by Stevie Wonder in the '80's and '90's.  Subquestion -- is it in fact unfair to criticize a formerly great artist for his latter- day sins?  "Is it better to burn out than to fade away?"
We didn't even really have it.  I happen to know for a fact that the only Stevie Wonder single we have is "Don't Drive Drunk." I was just goofing on the straight, and it never cost you a penny.
Oh, so what's the point then?
"Our customers?" You think that Mr. L.L. Bean out there is going to be a regular?
No, but would you think, from that one sentence.  That I was going to see it?
Just listen to me.  If I said to you --
Would you... would you get the impression that I wanted to see it?
Laura.  Her dad died.
I have a television.
Did you know that after that song was recorded, Jan himself crashed his --
Hey Rob.
Fuck!  I knew it!  You're going through one of those what-does-it- all-mean things.
There's been a rash of them, recently. I find it a little unnerving.  In fact Marco called a few months back, and he wanted to see me, and rehash the past as they say, and I wasn't really up for it.  Do all men go through this?
Liz, hold on a second --  What?
Hello, Rob.  Remember me?  I'm Ray. Ian.
Well, I liked you.  You were a deejay, and I thought you were hot, and I didn't have a boyfriend, and I wanted one.
Yeah, sure.  More so then than I am now.  That's life though, isn't it?
Okay, okay, we have a nine percent chance of getting back together. Does that clarify the situation?
I'm too tired for this now.  I know I'm asking a lot, but will you take off for a while so I can get my stuff packed up?  I need to be able to think while I do it and I can't think while you're here.
Fine.  One.
Nevermind.
Just ask it!
Is what better?  Better than what?
Jesus Christ, Rob.  Is that really what's bothering you?
You really think it would make a difference either way?
Well the answer is that I don't know either.  We haven't done it yet.
I haven't felt like it.
No.  I was living with you, remember? We've slept together but we haven't made love.  Not yet.  But I'll tell you one thing.  The sleeping together is better.
Will you please just go?
You make me laugh much more than Ray does, if that's what you're getting at.  But I already knew you could make me laugh.  It's everything else I don't know about.
Mmm hmm.
Oh ho, so very infrequently.
Thank you.  I appreciate it.  I can't reciprocate.
I didn't mess things up because I was scared.  I slept with Ray because I was sick of you.  And I needed something to snap me out of it.
I don't want to go back.
C'mon.
Okay.
I'm going to talk to you about whether you want to get married or not.  To me.
I mean it.
Oh, well thanks a fucking bunch.
Not in love, exactly, but...
Would you marry me if I was?
Right.  Okay, then.  Shall we go?
I don't know.
Are you persuadable?
Fair enough.
I'm just sick of thinking about it all the time.
This stuff.  Love and marriage.  I want to think about something else.
Shut up.  I'm only trying to explain.
I dunno.  Didn't think about it, really.  It was the asking that was the important thing.
Everything go alright?
That way.  You?
And so it is.  I'll talk to you later.
Right.
Naw.  Those are for us.
Go to hell.
Yes.
You needn't worry Miss Cartwright. I've been at this a very long time.
Not your concern.
That bothers you?
He's dead.  Whatever I may or may not feel means exceedingly little to him now.
You?
Have you gone to the police?
Why not?  I'm sure they'd love to hear your story.
You are being foolish.
Go home.
There's a catch.  You're supposed to wear 19th century clothing.
Come here, Brenna.
Now there's a new topic.
I've seen nobleman swords that weren't as well preserved.  It's just a hunk of peasant iron.  Why would he be carrying it around in an alley?
You are the same?
Yes.  Always.
It is less.
I don't know why.
Muy Bien!
Do what you must.
Not likely.
Thanks.
What are you doing here?
My quarry grows clever with age.  And the others, incompetent.
What are you getting at?
Why don't you fellows get your own news?
It doesn't have to rhyme!
Wait a minute, Bruce. Have you got that money?
On second thought, would you let me have it? I'll get the tickets.
Believe me, Bruce, I know what I'm doing. He'd get you in a crap game --
I know a lot of men who didn't do anything till they met Walter Burns. Please, dear.
I'll be careful, darling. You be, please.
Oh -- mother -- she -- I don't know where she went.
No, I was going to give it to her -- but she left hurriedly.
Oh, yes. Here it is.
I don't think she'll need you very much -- I aim to do most of the protecting myself.
Why shouldn't I make Hildy my beneficiary? I've got nobody else to leave it to.
Well, you'll take care of her. After all, if that doctor's right, I'm going to live for a long time yet. Look, Bruce, this is a debt of honor. I was a very bad husband: Hildy could have got a lot of alimony if she'd wanted to, but she wouldn't take any. She had it coming to her, but she was too independent.
Figure it this way: I ought to be good for twenty-five years. By that time, you'll probably have made enough so that the money won't mean anything. But suppose you haven't made good -- don't you think Hildy's entitled to a quiet old age without any worries?
And remember this, Bruce! I love her, too.
And the beauty of it is she'll never have to know 'till I've passed on. Maybe she'll think kindly of me --- after I'm gone.
No, Bruce, you didn't come between us. It was all over for her before you came on the scene. For me -- it'll never be over.
Suppose she is -- I have feelings, too! Do you know where I've been for the last couple of hours? Locked up in a police station and she didn't move to do anything about it.
And now I don't know where my mother is. She may be lost.
She's -- well, she's very motherly. That's about the best description I know.
No, you don't!
All I know is that instead of two weeks in Atlantic City with my bridegroom, I spent two weeks in a coal mine with John Kruptzky -- age sixty-three -- getting food and air out of a tube! You don't deny that. Do you?
Well, suppose we did? That isn't what I got married for. What's the good of -- Look, Walter, I came up here to tell you that you'll have to stop phoning me a dozen times a day -- sending twenty telegrams -- all the rest of it, because I'm --
What?!!
Walter, you're wonderful in a loathesome sort of way. Now, would you mind keeping quiet long enough for me to tell you what I came up here for?
I have a lunch date. I just want --
No, I can't.
Don't tell me what to do! We're divorced -- I'm a free woman. You're not my husband and you're not my boss! And what's more, you're not going to be my boss.
Just what I said. That's what I --
That's the first time you've been right today. That's what I --
You bet I've got a better offer.
I know, Walter, but I --
You wouldn't have taken me if I hadn't been doll-faced!
Listen, Walter --
Well, the paper'll have to learn to do without me. And so will you. It just didn't work out, Walter.
I wasn't satisfied! I suppose I proposed to you!
You -- you --
His wife had twins and he went out to celebrate and got as drunk as a lord. They can't even find him.  I tell you, drink is the ruin of this nation.
So -- Sweeney gets twins -- and Earl Williams gets hanged tomorrow.
You can't take that desk out. It's crawling with cops outside.
Hildy, you think I could? After this story?  Here! You're just nervous.
Who says so? I'm going to the morgue -- to look --
Thanks.
Yeah. Only -- only I'm not leaving, Walter.
No, he won't. I wired him that I wasn't coming.
On the nine o'clock train. That's the one he took, isn't it?
It's awfully clear now. Bruce needs a wife who can give him a home -- and affection -- and peace. I couldn't do that for him, Walter. I'm what you made me -- a cheap reporter who'd give up her soul for a story!... Is that job still open?
Thanks, Walter, but it's no good. We tried it.
A fine honeymoon, with a murderer right in the boudoir! And that other honeymoon in a coal mine!
Well, maybe I'd like to know just once!
Niagara Falls! Walter, you don't mean that?
Walter!
What would you do if it was a daughter?
What's the matter with my brains?
Well, I'd like to be lady-like and think it over.
Take that mush out of your mouth!
Hildy -- I can't. I'm busy -- I -- Let me up, Hildy. Earl Williams has escaped --
Good. Now I want to ask you fellows a couple of questions. Did Earl Williams know what he was doing when he fired that gun?
Aw, why don't you let her alone? She's ill!
I tell you, it's a screwy set-up. We better hold onto 'em both.
Little rum in yours, too?
What do I know about Williams?
No, I couldn't do that.
How would you like to have a job for three hundred and fifty dollars a month. That's almost a hundred dollars a week!
So do you what, you hoodoo!  And now, Mr. Pinkus, if you'll come with us, we'll take you over to the Warden's office and deliver this reprieve.
All right, Judge.
I thought so, too.
Mother!
Sure you could, Earl -- but you wouldn't want to do that, would you? You wouldn't want to kill anybody.
Quiet, Mollie!
The what?
You mean here in the city?
Yeah, hold the line. Hey, this looks good. An old lady just called the detective bureau and claims Williams is hiding in her cellar. Well - we've looked every other place. Want to go out on it?
Put your hand on mine, get the knack of it.
Looking for shrapnel.
Not now. They wouldn't believe me.
The sodding water table.
Thanks. I hope you can come for the launching.
I will if you will!
That's it.
I wasn't too old when I started the course. I was too old when it finished.
A clerk. I'm doing a typing course. I'll be typing for England.
Out.
No, I won't.
Wasn't it lovely?
We did the decent thing.
We can't change what's past. Not even the war can do that.
Well! I'm not talking about Mac. He hasn't toughed me for ages. And not often ever. My life started when Mac went on nights.
Go tell him to get your Grandpa.
OK.
Nice.
Shit, I don't remember exactly. I took over for my Pa just after the Duke nabbed the Oscar.
Yeah, my Pa wasn't right in the head after that.
Hell, boy there some other Duke you know about?  A great American.
I figured that much. Why the fuck you asking so many jackass questions for?
I don't drive cross country.
I don't.
Y'all find us country people real funny like don't ya... well, God damn pack up the mule and sling me some grits, I'ze a gotta get me some schooling.
Well fuck me Side Sally, who want to read about all that horse shit anyway.
Fuck. I think we blew a tire.
Turn that fucking radio off!
Where ya headed?
Quiet.
That's nice.
Hey, listen to this... I think this is related to our Dr. Satan.
Yeah, in this book there's a chapter called Self Made Freaks about how people would mutilate themselves in order to work in a freak show. It mostly talks about tattooed people and wild men of Borneo and shit like that, but there is one mention of a single case where a woman was suspected of having her arms removed on purpose to become an arm-less wonder.
It says, "records show that Ellie Thompson was born in 1914 of normal physical stature and lived a life of normal bearings, until such time that she was placed in the care of the Willows State Mental Facility."
Now she was put in the nuthouse in 1930 at the age of 16.
Blah, blah, blah... it doesn't say, but she was released sometime in 1937, only to reappear as Ellie Bogdan, the arm-less wonder. Says she, "criss-crossed the United States constantly in carnivals and freak shows until her death in 1946."
These dates perfectly correspond with the time frame of our beloved Dr. Satan working at the looney bin. I'll bet he amputated her arms.
I don't know, I just thought it was interesting.
I don't...  ...I just thought it was weird.
Sleeping.
No please, let me sit this one out.
I resign.
Christ, I hope this isn't more crappy folk art. It's so quaint... it's so primal... it's so crap.
Aw, shit...  I gotta pee anyway.
What? I didn't hear anything.
Well, I thought I'd maybe take in a hoedown.
I don't doubt that.
Huh?
Oh, don't blow everything out of proportion.
This can't be real, this can't be real, this can't be real.
Who's your Daddy!
Shit... fuck procedure.
Call the chief... We found 'em.
Son, your mother and I are doing a production of The Gin Game at the local community theater. We forgot to take off our make-up.
Merci. I... Do you... would you like to go get a cup of coffee, perhaps?
Now I am truly embarrassed. Forgive me. I should not have asked such a stupid question. I know you are a very important man and...
I am a foolish little thing. I am pink in my face, no? It is only that I have been so lonely lately and... I am ashamed. I'll see you tomorrow, okay? Unless... Am I fired now?
I don't know, Nathan. What are you supposed to do?
Funny. I thought that's exactly what you did. You just don't have the courage to admit it to yourself.
God, you're beautiful.
No. You look so beautiful.
I'm... I'm going to leave Lila. I can't stop thinking about you.
No!
That goddamn Neanderthal? I'm the one who gave him the idea for the combination bug spray-sun screen! Did you know that?!
Of course not, that Swedish thief! He's a thief of hearts!  I love you, Gabrielle.
Just give me some time to let Lila down easily. She's a really nice girl and I don't want to hurt her more than is necessary.
Very well.
Nathan told my brother.
Yeah, although I'm not going to turn him in. I like hearing the dirt.
I'm sorry that I became so upset.
It's only that I really enjoy your company and...
Yes, and...
Yes.  Please don't talk with food in your mouth, Lila. Please. You're so pretty and it only mars your... I'm sorry. I'm being critical.
If it's a person, why should we go see it? It's not like it's nature or anything. It's just a person.  Sometimes people who live in the woods don't want to be seen. They live in the woods because they're anti-social, Lila. We have to respect that.
Please, Nathan. I really need this. You've been working late a lot.
Should I come with?
Ummm. It's good.
And because you did so well, we have a little surprise for you.
Even better.
Yes?
Packard. Sarah Packard.
No, I'm fine.
I've never been to Louisville.
It's what Eddie wants. He, uh, told me to give you some money.
The name's Gordon. Bert Gordon.
Miss Packard. How do you do?
It's all right. She had a little too much to drink, that's all. Forget it.  Go upstairs and sleep it off.
And just how do you figure that, Bert? What do you figure I owe you?
In Louisville it was seventy-five per cent.
What if I don't pay ya, Bert?
Yeah, like a church. Church of the Good Hustler.
I'll be alive when I get out, Charlie.
Oh, don't play it small, Charlie. It don't look good on you.
So am I... Sit down.  Would you get us a couple of drinks?
I don't play pool, Mr. Felson. I play billiards. My house, my game. You don't have to play if you don't want to.
Let's cut out the small stuff, huh? Hundred dollar freeze-out. Ten games, ten bucks a game, winner take all. And then we'll see who quits.
Call it.
How come you didn't catch your bus?
Then why go to the bus station?
Around.
Cramped.  You always drink like this, so early in the morning?
No, not always.
Take your choice. I've got enough so we won't have to go out of the house till Tuesday.
When you've got money, you'll pay.
The bills are right here. You didn't say what you wanted.
Eggs. How do you like them?
You wanna drink?
What's it so hot in here for?
He went off someplace.
Why?
Preacher! Go on down and get me some bourbon. J. T. S. Brown. No ice, no glass.
It comes back.  Flashes.  My name.
We don't know that --
Virginia...?
It's that time of year again. We should get a pretty good show out here.
Because the sky is so clear out here.
What, Jim, what?
Yes, Mr. Gardner.
But it's not, Jimmy.
Let's go look at the sand pit behind your house.
They didn't find any signs of life on the Viking missions.
Why, yes.
All right.  I'll be right back.
He's a good man.
I wanted a career. Didn't you ever want to be part of something special?
I could have evacuated the cities hours ago.  You know, when I flew in the Gulf War everything is simple. We knew what we had to do. It's not simple anymore, Connie. A lot of people died today. How many didn't have to?
Remember I told you that the signal hidden within our satellite signal is slowly recycling down to extinction.
That signal. It's a countdown.
Think. It's like in chess. First you strategically position your pieces. Then, when the timing's right. You strike.
Because last time I saw him I punched him in the face.
He wasn't the President then.
I can't shake her free.
We're down to approximately fifteen percent, Sir.  If you calculate the time it takes them to destroy a city and move on, we're looking at world wide destruction of every major city within the next thirty six hours.
This is crazy. We're loosing our first strike capabilities!
You know how I like to make a big entrance.
Don't get premature on me, Jimmy. We don't light up 'til the Fat Lady sings.
Just what the hell do you think you're doing?
The other bombers might have more luck. We shouldn't just give up...
Papers, sir. Got it here.
The search for the Cup of Christ is the search for the divine in all of us.
It's... a leap of faith. Oh, God.
Don't take that tone with me, my good man. Now buttle off and tell Baron Brunwald that Lord Clarence MacDonald and his lovely assistant are here to view the tapestries.
Dear me, the man is dense. This is a castle, isn't it? There are tapestries?
How dare he?!
We're through!
Look at the artistry of these carvings and the scrollwork.
How do you know?
Don't call me that, please.
I came to get you! What do you think?
My lucky charm.
Try and burn through the ropes.
I don't know. The first available flight out of Germany.
I know, Dad!
It happens to me all the time.
What did you find, Dad?
Compensation for my brother-in-law's car. Indy, your father and Brody --
They have them. In the belly of that steel beast.
This is a different situation, Dr. Jones. These people are like children. We have to lead them slowly into the twentieth century.
You should have been there...
Maybe... but how do you explain The Thuggee shrine I saw right below the palace?
A bonus, Dr. Jones. That is poison. You just drank the rest of it.
Yeah, that's what happened...
You are in no position to give orders, Dr. Jones.
Who cares? Where's that diamond!
Holy cow -- India? How do you know we're in --
It's pulling me deeper!
It's curling around me! Damn it, stop talking and do something!
What does the writing say?
That's Shiva? What's he giving the Priest?
You mean magical like the rock that was stolen from that village?
I'm a scientist. I like doing research on certain "nocturnal activities" --
Willie, open the door! GET US OUT OF HERE!
You've got to go to sleep now.
I don't blame you... this hasn't been what you'd call a fun vacation...
They don't cry about you. They cry about the elephants leaving.
They got no food to feed them. So they taking the elephants away to sell them.
Yes?
Loading a gun.
Kill myself.
Yep.
Used to be, things were bad. No job...no money...no girl. Now I got all that and I'm crazy too.
Hear voices don't I.
Then I'm crazy.
Outrun them.
I'd be helpless and useless. They don't have the PEM. Without that...there's no chance.
They're busy covering their asses. They're not the type of people we need."
I am. You are.
You're the one talking to a little guy in your head.  ...We'll have to do it on our own.
You gotta help.
We're a team...My...talent. Your... mobility.
Think of the scientific data we'll gain. Come on, lets get out of here.
You do. To get out of here. You're gonna be me.
You can't go home. When UST finds we're gone, they'll come after you and put us away.
Well, if not to kill, then to bother and annoy.
What? What do you mean?
Where are you staying?
Not blue enough.
Are you serious?
I don't know!
I can't keep up.
You have to! Quickly!
Not sure at all.
Just say the words. Just like I told you.
...Shit! It's just money.
Thing is...I think I'm in love with her.
Face it, we're the men for the job. Besides, if someone is really chasing you, the best way to avoid them is to keep moving ...and FIND THE GODDAMN PEM.
I insist.
I'll prove it. We'll repeat their procedures...put a man in our POD, bring it down, and then...inject him.
We met on the beach.
What?
Oh yeah, thanks...
Just give me the keys.
Blake?
Yes?
It's not apparent.
Disinterest?
I am sort of scattered.
You are.
Oh sure.
Lots of my clients are rich guys... They like danger..like playing with drugs and things...running around, acting mysterious.
He's a client of mine! What's the matter. You can't suspect Dieter. He's a famous photographer. He makes millions.
It was my choice.
Doesn't matter. I'm on your side.
Now what?
Why are you on to him?
Why'd you invite me here?
What about the others.
What does he know?
You better take a good look! Because I'm getting two things: pissed off and curious! Now, any of these guys been offered jobs in corporate security after they retire? Either one of those guys have ex-agent pals already in those jobs? Like, for instance, their ex-supervisor, who's already at Brown & Williamson as we fucking speak?
Excuse me, Lowell. Sharon's on line 3.
It's not a rumor. It's a sale.  If Tisch can unload CBS for $81 a share to Westinghouse and then is suddenly threatened with a multibillion-dollar lawsuit from Brown & Williamson, that could screw up the sale, could it not?
What caliber is your gun?
Yes, sir. What caliber is your gun?
I'm told unusual promises were made to Wigand.
And, I'm told there are questions as to our "star witness'" veracity.
Our standards have to be higher than anyone else's, because we are the standard... for everyone else...
Try the car.
Hello? Yeah...
Alright.
I'll call you then.
What do you mean?
Oh, torture? Great ratings.
No, I usually sit around in my hotel room, dressed like this at 5:30 in the morning, sleepy look on my face.
Black, black...
They're afraid of you, aren't they?
Marcuse. Yeah. He was my mentor. He had a major influence on the New Left in the late '60s... and on me, personally.
My father? What the hell's that got to do with my father?
You charge by the hour?
Well, my father left us when I was five-years old. He was not the most ingenious man I ever knew... Let's get back to Brown & Williamson. If you decide to go on "60 Minutes," I got to know everything about why you got fired.
They're gonna dig up stuff from your past, they're gonna throw it at you. I got to know what they're gonna throw. You understand?
I'm not pushing you around!  I'm asking you questions.
...to a network, probably, we're all commodities.  To me? You are not a commodity. What you are is important.
Run that Sandefur piece on "nicotine's not addictive." Run that on-camera. Then cut right to Wigand with "I believe they perjured..." Then go wide to the CEOs all taking the oath. Back on Jeff and play the pause after the word "felt" on the B-side...
I'm on a leave of absence. Forced vacation.
Yeah. Yeah, I will.
Then hold it off the air until you got that. But I want to go to New York. And I want to go on the record. Right now!
Possibly, yes. That is one of the possible consequences of your testifying here today. That's right...
You did good, Massey!
And -- there's no talking her out of it. Believe me, I've tried.
She said "penetrate." Heh heh heh.
What part?
Why not? I'm going to have her for a lifetime.
We rest, Your Honor.
So, that's good, right?
I think Ming is older than Tong.  What is this?
I know you do.
Howard is a beautiful person.
Miles. Miles. Miles.
It was his idea. It was a gesture of love and trust. Be happy for me, Miles.
Have you tried the duck?
Don't go. Stay with me for a while.
Hello Marylin.
I bet.
Now. But first, he worked for you.
Wait just a second there. You sent him here. You unearthed this pestilence.
Sometimes I forget.
We do have a man for you.
I want to be exposed.
Oh, just a routine mammogram. She said to say hello. She's going to Positano with your brother's family.
No. Not exactly. It didn't exactly cool. Marylin is a knock-out. And very sexy -- but -- there's a lot of it out there.
You know what I mean when I say "it."
Seems like there's more of it than ever before --
I don't know. I can assume...
I'm not sure.
Video.
Miles.
The plastic surgeon! I read about you in LA Style.
Well, not just divorce. She used to say "I want to be divorced from some big dumb rich guy..." And I guess her dream is coming true.  I'm happy for you Patty
Yeah.
He's no good, Ellie, and you know it. You married him only because I told you not to.
She hasn't had a thing yesterdayor today.
Yessir. She refuses them all.
It's not quite that simple.  I've dealt with prisoners in my time, but this one
But it's King Westley on the phone.
There's another wire from Peter, sir. They're in Glen Falls, Michigan.
Yeah?
Maybe they doand maybe they don't.
What are you talking about?
Will you please tell me what you're raving about!
You must have me confused with
Oh, this?I like privacy when I retire. I'm very delicate in that respect. Prying eyes annoy me.  Behold the walls of Jericho![4] Maybe not as thick as the ones that Joshua blew down with his trumpet, but a lot safer. You see, I have no trumpet.  Now just to show you my heart's in the right place, I'll give you my best pair of pajamas.
I know a couple of truck drivers I'd like to have you meet sometime.  Come on, sit down.
Egg. One eggdoughnutsblack coffee. That's your ration till lunch. Any complaints?
I'd have gotten you some cream but it meant buying a whole pint.
What makes you so disgustingly cheerful this morning?
I thought maybeuh"believe you me" told you a couple of snappy stories.
Just shows you how wrong a guy can be. Doughnut?
No. No. It's too good a story.
Yeah?
Um. You're doing all right.
One consolation; you can never be lonesome.
Santa Claus?
Oh. Is that how you met him?
Say, where did you learn to dunk, in finishing school?
Of course you shouldn't. You don't know how to do it. Dunking's an art. Don't let it soak so long. A dip and plop, into your mouth. If you let it soak so long, it'll get soft and fall off. It's all a matter of timing. I ought to write a book about it.
Just goes to show you. Twenty millions and you don't know how to dunk.
We're not going to sleep out here, are we?
Needn't rub it in.  What're you eating?
Raw?
No!!  It's a wonder you couldn't get me something I can eat.
I hate the horrid stuff.
Darling!
Come here, you little fool!
Oh, thank you. Thank you very much.  Here.
When does the bus leave?
Thank you.
What time is it?
Don't "Joe" me.
You mean about the Andrews' kid?
Who?
Orange, New Jersey.
Yeah. Just babies.
Oh, gee, Misteryou wouldn'tyou ain't thinkin' about
SuresureI'll keep my trap shut. you can depend on me, Mister.
No.
You can't ever say crime don't pay in Louisiana, Jim - only not as good as it used to.  Good chowder, ain't it?
Oh, I first heard these street cats jiving about him back in '56, '57 when I lived down in the Quarter.
Swishes.  They swish, y'know.  Young fags, you know.  They'd come into my bureau needing help, no bread, and I'd say, hey man, I ain't Rockefeller, who gonna back you up?  These cornmuffins go to the phone and dial...
Maybe I have a little more respect for this country's institutions than you do, Susie.  You tell me how the hell you can keep a conspiracy going between the Mob, the CIA, FBI, and Army Intelligence and who knows what else, when you know you can't even keep a secret in this room between 12 people!  We got leaks everywhere! We're going to trial here!  What the hell do we really got?  Oswald, Ruby, Banister, Ferrie are dead.  Shaw - maybe he's an agent, I don't know, but as a covert operator in my book he's wide open for blackmail 'cause of his homosexuality.
Twenty dollars each time.  Hell, it's no secret.  That's what I'm here for.
Let's start making some assumptions about the man.  Why would he leave a path as big as Lee Harvey Oswald's? This is not a thin trail, gentlemen, it is a very wide one.  Who found the evidence?  Who set him up?  Lou, Bill, Susie, I want you to go back and check all the sightings of Oswald in Dallas, New Orleans and Mexico in the summer and fall of '63 - see if it's the same guy.
I don't see any violence, Jim.  Heart attack, maybe an aneurysm.  Looks like natural causes.
How could I?  Dave, as you know, President Kennedy was assassinated on Friday.  A man named Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested as a suspect and then was murdered yesterday by a man named Jack Ruby.  We've heard reports that Oswald spent the summer in New Orleans and we've been advised you knew Oswald pretty well.
But you are aware, he served in your Civil Air Patrol unit when he was a teenager.
I'm sure you've seen this.  Perhaps you knew this man under another name?
Well that must've been mistaken information we got.  Thanks for straightening it out for us.  There is one other matter that's come up, Dave.  We were told you took a trip to Texas shortly after the assassination of Friday.
What was so appealing about Houston?
Dave, may I ask why the urge to go ice skating in Texas happened to strike you during one of the most violent thunderstorms in recent memory?
I see.  And where did you drive?
Why Galveston?
And then Sunday?
Did you bag any geese on this trip?
But the boys told us they didn't get any.
Your young friends also told us you had no weapons in the car.  Dave, isn't it a bit difficult to hunt for geese without a shotgun?
I see.  Dave thank you for your time.  I'm sorry it has to end inconveniently for you, but I'm going to have you detained for further questioning by the FBI.
Dave, I find your story simply not believable.
But you were a qualified pathologist. Was this Army general a qualified pathologist?
But you took his orders.  He was directing the autopsy.
There were admirals.
Negative on his tax records. Classified.  First time I know a D.A. can't get a tax record.  I put together a list of all the CIA files on Oswald that were part of the Warren Report and asked for them.  There are about 1200 documents...  Oswald in the USSR, in Mexico City, Oswald and the U2, a CIA 201 personnel file, a memo from the Director on Oswald, travel and activities - can't get one of them.  All classified as secret on the grounds of national security.  It's real strange.
No, I don't think I am, Susie.  Anyone else?
Yes, it was about 11 in the morning. I was driving west on Elm Street toward the Triple Underpass, in a rented car - a blue Valiant.  I'll never forget that day.
Tough day.
Liz, I'm really sorry.  The meeting went much longer than expected.
I don't know what to say except I'm sorry.  I just don't have rabbits on my mind.
I don't know what to tell them.  How 'bout the truth - I'm doing my job to make sure they can grow up in a country where justice won't be an arcane, vanished idea they read about in history books, like the dinosaurs or the lost continent of Atlantis.
It's going to get worse, honey.
Call me Willie.  I ain't got nuthin' but time, Mr. Garrison.  Minutes, hours, days, years of'em.  Time just stands still here like a snake sunnin' itself in the road...
Upstairs.  In 1963 that was the Office of Naval Intelligence - And just by coincidence, Banister, before he was FBI, was ONI.  What do they say?
I'd say the opposite - hypertension.
Russell, honestly you sound like one of those kooky critics spreading paranoia like prairie fire.  I just can't believe the Chief Justice of the United States would put his name on something that wasn't true.
More than ten years.
Never touched me.
You just need some sleep, Lou.  It won't look so bad when...
If you must know, virtually nothing.
Less than you would guess.  Most days two to three assistant D.A.'s. A handful of police investigators.
That's it.
Oh, that's not a problem.
Course you didn't.
The usual things. I'm a flight attendant with Cabo Air.
I'm tellin' you, I don't know nothin' about that fuckin' shit.
In cash.
I think maybe I have more options than I thought.
Are you?
What I meant was have a lawyer do the negotiating for you.
Well, if the A.T.F. guy is the one who wants you, that'll only interest him up to a point.
How'd you find that out?
He called you?
What?... What'd you do?
I go back to work tomorrow.
They seem to like the idea.
Yea, but I'm going to dress it up. Put the money in a shopping bag and hand it to someone I meet here.
He always just picked it up at my place. But with A.T.F. involved, I want to stage it. You know, make it look more intriguing, like we know what the fuck we're doin'. Then it's up to Ray Nicolet, the A.T.F. guy to follow the shopping bag.
Right around here, in the food court.
Do you think they bought it?
You know, a good cop won't let you know he knows you're fulla shit.
They've confiscated all his other stuff. But this one's sorta left over. The registration's in the glove box, the keys were under the seat... What's a matter, haven't you ever borrowed someone's car?
Yeah?
You two meet?
You talk to him?
His full name is Louis Gara. He just got out from serving four years in Susanville.
Bank robbery? Do you know what he does for Ordell?
We've been following Mr. Gara, and he's definitely working for Ordell.
Great...  ...Wanda!
Got some o.j.?
The cops didn't try and strangle my ass.
Well, I ain't playin with you. I'm gonna unload both these motherfuckers, you don't do what I tell you. Understand what I'm saying?
I said, you understand what I'm saying
Go sit over in that chair.
They already know it's you.
Look, the only way I can get permission to fly is if I agree to help them. Which is what I have to appear to be doing. So I give them something they already know. You.
I told them you got a half a million dollars in Mexico, and you want me to bring it here.
We're partners, Baby, sorta. I ain't gonna screw you. You haven't told me where I put it for you.
Yeah.
I was pretty much the same height now as I was then.
Noooo, I was a surfer girl. Besides, I was only fourteen. I couldn't go to discos.
The beach. Or get high, drop acid at a friend's place. I was a K.L.O.S. girl. I hated disco.
All right already.
What's your cost?
Are you serious?
That's not what I meant when I asked did you trust her.
If she's got it, why didn't she take it all?
Maybe the Feds got it.
That's why I never checked it. The bag felt right.
I don't know. Either she has it or the Feds.
Fella named Beaumont. They have him up at county. It started out drunk driving, but they wrote it up "possession of a concealed weapon." Dumb monkey-ass had a pistol on him.
They ran his name and got a hit. He's been in before.
I think falling in live with movie stars is something that happens to a man as he gets older.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
No.
Yes.
Where do you want to go?
Home?  This is your home. You're dead.
What are you then?
Then what are you doing here?
What isn't happening?
There is no out of here. You've been killed. Don't you remember?
Oh God!
Stop!!!!
What do you want from me?
Nobody's been talking to nobody. You don't have a case, you hear me? It's pure and simple. Now leave me alone. Okay?
An explosion, just like Paul's.
The postal service. I'm a mailman.
It's good to see you.
I don't want to know.
Guilty thoughts. See what happens when you cheat on me, even in your mind?
Go to sleep.
I thought you said it was a nightmare?
No. Have you seen my glasses?
I don't know.
Jezzie, I can't see.
What does that have to do with anything? Does it explain the barricaded subway stations? Does it explain those Godforsaken creatures?
They're like demons, Jez.
Those guys tried to kill me tonight. They were aiming right at me.
They weren't human!
Lie down!
Sam, Tony, come in here.
It might be for me.
Hello ... No. He's not here. I haven't seen him all night ... I don't know when ... What? Tell him what?  Vietnam? ... What experiments?
With wings.  You transport me, you know that? You carry me away.
Like it was yesterday.
I no from around here.
Call my chiropractor.
Louis Schwartz. Nostrand Avenue.
You come home with me.
Are you kidding? We've put up more of her cousins. You wouldn't believe how they breed down there.
Alright, asshole.
We don't have a choice!
Somebody's gonna have to go back to the engine room.
I think I broke my arm.
Er, guys. Where's the Hockey Player?
Use the thrusters and you'll be fine. We'll huddle together out there.
You just keep an eye out.
Fuckin A...
No you don't!
Were you close to your father?
I know you.
I'm thinking Rizzo was right.
Maybe we should go with them. Like you said, your Space Lab connections can deal with this thing. At least we'll be safe.
Shut up, Thorgan!
Keep your shirt on! I'm working on it. You won't believe what we found.  Adrienne! Stoney!
Later.
Kay-em 14.
Cybernetics science droid, fluent in over six...
I'm afraid I cannot assist.
Who are you apologizing to?
He wants to kill you...and me...and everyone on this ship.
Nanotechnology.
We've had Nano-Tech for the last 30 years.
You're crazy!
My boat's neat, dad!
Don't tell me my business!  Quarter-mile, that way. Full throttle.
Have to pump her steady, s'all.
Older, sillier.
No. Home here.
Matt Hooper, the specialist they send down from the Oceanographic Institute.
What d'ya mean?
They must've hit something.
I can't stand here doing nothing!
I agree. If she's going to advertise, I wouldn't recommend out-of-town papers. Amity people could take care of this.
You're leaving?
Is that a boat?
Like those Cousteau specials on television? I think it's for the kids, but I love them.
I saw a show with sea otters, and a big turtle... Mikey loved it. Made me promise to get him one. Will you live on the boat?
Martin hates boats. Hates the water. On the ferry to the mainland, he sits in the car the whole way over. He's got this childhood thing, there's a clinical word for it.
Hell, in the old days we went out with good charts, good sounding lead, and a damn good compass. Nowadays, these kids are afraid to go out without depth finders, radar, radio, electric toothbrush, every stupid thing...
Ever see one like this?
Let's just cut him open and see what's inside...
I did the prep questions for this lab last night. You can copy my answers if you need to.
Um, hi?
Yeah, I did ask her if she wanted to go. A bunch of us from the team are going to Benihana, then the prom, then Vijay's parents' cabin.
I just see a lot of teenage mothers come through here. It's obviously a poisonous environment for a baby to be raised in.
Listen, Bren-duhhh, I think you're the one overstepping boundaries. You're acting like you're the one who has to go through this and get huge and push a baby out of your vag for someone else. Besides, who cares if he's married? I can have friends who are married.
You don't know anything about me!
Well, I just have the baby and give it to you, right?
I mostly work from home. I'm a composer.
No, more commercial stuff.
Commercials.
Have you seen those ads for Titanium Power men's deodorant?
I wrote that.
They'd say you came a long way out here not knowing if anyone would be home.
Why? What the big deal?
I'll handle this. I'm really good at diffusing mom-type rage.
Isn't that great? I got it when I was in Japan with my band. She reminds me of you.
Vanessa, right?
This is the baby. Your baby.
I'm not crying. I'm allergic to fine home furnishings. See you later.
Yeah, well, there's this couple who've been trying to have a baby for five years.
Jesus, I didn't say it was.
There's a guy in here who's giving away a piano. Free for the hauling! We should put it in Bleeker's yard.
No, I heard you. I just can't give the baby to people who describe themselves as "wholesome." I'm looking for something a little edgier.
I was thinking a graphic designer, mid-thirties, and his cool Asian wife who dresses awesome and plays bass. But I'm trying to not be too particular.
Yeesh, they sound like a cult. Besides, they're greedy bitches. They already have three kids!
God, Spermy. Must you always feed?
Juno just wanted a closer look at Kimber here.
Me neither. How 'bout you Carrie?
Early Grayce if this ain't your lucky day.
Do what?
You think Early's bad to me, don't you?
They ain't dangerous Adele. They're writers.
Early! Stop!!
How much do I owe you?
Forget about it, doesn't matter.
Thanks. What are you doing?
Bitch, bitch, bitch!
I heard that.
Why, what did he do?
...Brian hurt his foot.
Wasn't my fault...
Was up bitch?
What for? That guys a dick.
You think he's got any herb?
You think?
He lives on 76th?
Den less go Joe.
I know what you mean.
She hangs out at Nasa. She promotes for them.
How are you gonna fuck two virgins in a day? That shits gotta be against the law.
Bet.
You are?
Come on bitch. Throw your fists up.
Yes.
Yeah.
You want to fuck me. But you can't fuck me.
Because, you know why. You know.
Because I'm a virgin and I don't want no baby.
Why is that?
I wouldn't believe it?
But, I don't know. I'm just scared that things would change. Between us.
Oh it's OK. That's life. Maybe tomorrow I'll win lotto. Who knows? You don't. No one does.
Hell yeah, they don't know.
Whah you say? Dissdee?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Nothing. We just wanted to come by and see what you were up to.
Nah.
Chess tournaments can be boring sometimes.  People have a lot of free time.  They like to gossip.
Maybe you should.
What?
Check with the State.  If he's never killed outside of Washington the F.B.I. wouldn't have it.  Nolan?
Did anyone stand out?
Did anyone look suspicious?  Think!
What was suspicious about him?
You're not going to tell me that.
I'm beginning to think it doesn't mean anything.  Remember eventually revenge- -
Oh, I put a few games on for your daughter.  I hope you don't mind.
Fuck off!
My cheering section.
There's only two hardware stores on the whole Island.  We'll check that out. What about the blood?
Meaning?
What does that mean?
That's alright.  We'll take it from here.
Wait a minute.  There's an apartment in that area called the Castle Arms.
Just thought you might want to talk.
Whatever's on your mind.
Getting too hot in here for you?
How the hell can I relax after seeing what I just saw.
How could you?  Unless you were there.
What do you want on it?
Would you settle for pepperoni?
Why not?
Maybe you're afraid of what it says.
<u>What</u>?
We're not married <u>yet</u>.
All directions are the same here.
Two or three days! While Lyssa is in their hands?
But there is another entrance to this place.
There is no other way. You asked me why the Beast had come this time.
He has come for Lyssa.
Like you, she has extraordinary powers. He would make her his Queen.
No. She must agree of her own free will.
You are young. You don't understand the attraction of great power, and you forget the pain of long waiting.
Yes.
I found the body of the Seer in the stream.
I doubt it. The water is only an inch deep.
A forest near the Valley of Needles.
Perhaps he expected to eat it.
Why do they burn the villages? There's nothing to gain.
I intend to keep you alive, your majesty. So you can abdicate your throne and become my Warlord.
I ...  ... am Titch.
Oh, my poor stomach.
These walls do not lie! He will betray you.
Then he will die!
Such a vision will be opposed. Who seeks it?
With an old voice?
Yes. You have left your place in the Needle. It is the time, then.
I will seek the Fortress for you.
It's a hundred leagues from here.
Then the other Lyssa will share your fate. She will grow old in the Fortress as you have grown old here.
Pay attention to women, Leon.  They are dangerous, you know?
Listen, think about what you want to do, but don't worry, your money is there and it's safer than in a bank... Banks are robbed every five minutes!
OK.
...This is what I don't like, you see: you don't refrain me, but at the same time I can't get out!
There are better things.  You see the importance of the "moment".  Ten minutes early or late, he'd have seen death. He'd have suffered it.  This way, he already departed. Without knowing.
...Later.
I prefer waiting for a while...  I feel it would go the wrong way.
Not at all, Mathilda! I tell you because it's true! You'll buy the globe you told me about and you will choose, OK? We'll go where you want! I swear, you'll see, Mathilda!!
Giancarlo... Rinaldi.
Why am I such an authority?
I received my B.S. from the University of Pennsylvania, my P.H.D. from Bryn Mawr College.  I worked three years at the Boston University School of Medicine, during which time I had articles printed in the "Journal of Educational Psychology", "American Journal of Psychology", "Psychology Review" and "Science"... So I think it's safe to say my opinion is valid.
I won't let you die.
Pardon?
Routine, I assure you.  I just wanted to gage my health.  Am I healthy?
I'm going to ask you a question that may sound peculiar.
Yes.
What do you want from me?  Would I swim across an ocean for you?... Would I walk across the United States for you?  Yes... Yes I would.  You know that.
It'll make it.
I'm not proving to her.  I'm showing her.  And I know I don't have to.  I want to.  I've realized, love is about giving. I'm alive, I can still give to her. I want to give her everything I can.
You tell stories?
You're amazing.
They called her 'Lizy' in the book...  Sorry I was late.  My jeep died on the way over from the paper.
Pulitzer, here I come.
She knew you loved her.
I do.
Don't do this.
You should.  Children are a blessing from God.  I have four.
Hello.
Working? What do you mean, working? I'm walking.
I don't care about that. There's time left. You can have more money. You can drink all you want. You can talk or listen. Just stay, that's all I want.
Of course. Wow... you look extremely beautiful.
Don't know. My watch went the way of the car.
Why don't you go in and sit down. I have some gifts for you.
Well, then... I hope we don't run into any tonight.
I expect some kind of loyalty here. Just because I fuck for money doesn't give you cause to start picking up women and leaving me looking silly.
Last spring I happened to walk past a house that I had once patronized. There was a cool breeze blowing off the ocean and through the window I could see a bare leg. The girl must have been taking a break between customers. It was a strange moment for me because it reminded me of my mother and despite the fact that I was late for something already I just stayed there, loving the atmosphere of it and my memory and... the reason I'm telling you this epilogue is that I felt that I'd come full circle.
Fifth and Mayflower. You know it?
Alone. Alone. I'm here alone.
Right here at the hotel. Why?
A date. What, are you a hooker?  What do you mean a date?  I've got a wife back home. I just came over to talk for a few minutes.
It's me, Yuri.
He's the top defense attorney in the state. Of course he's an ass.
He's an ass that's gonna try.
That's not what's important.
Not that I saw. But like I said, I went straight upstairs to take a shower.
I saw Brooke standing over his body, drenched in his blood.
No, she'd stashed it by then.
That's touching, Elle, but we need an alibi.
But you agreed last night. In the office? When we were discussing my "career"?
I don't know.
No. Sometimes I say "Okay" instead of "Fine".
What's the point?  Look at me.
I know. He has it sent out.
You're kidding!
Thank you. I love you, too.
The professors? Yeah, they tend to do that. Socratic method.
No, she can't move for an hour.
Gay men know designers. Straight men don't.
I don't know! I don't know anything any more!  I just need to be by myself.
And engraved... Gives it that extra little something, doesn't it?  See you tomorrow!
No.
I gave her my word, Warner.
Where's the Rock?
Then we smash 'em?
We're both of us damned, my beauty.
I didn't know... I --
I said, I mean no harm... I thought this as empty tomb.
Oh, no, never... nothing like that... never crossed my mind.
Well, er... no.  I mean, you don't look like dragons I've heard of.
Cathay?
East of Mercia?
You don't ravage the countryside, devouring maidens and burning the crops?
Then you'll understand my quest.  An ogre named Blackheart has killed the last stag unicorn and stolen his horn.  The world outside is cursed, plunged into eternal winter.  Unless I return the alicorn, the earth will be frozen forever.
It's terrible.
I need your help.  In order to fight Blackheart, I must wear the armor of Achilles.  I --
Oh no... Don't you understand?
What does she want from me?
You do the praying.  I've work ahead.
What's left of me... How do I recognize the armor of Achilles?
Whatever for?
Aye.  Said to follow it to the edge of night.  But is this the right bird?
Birds speak to me all the time. What did it say?
Sounds like the bird we want.  All right lads, follow yon raven!
Something the matter?
Stay on your guard, Jack.  The bug is enchanted surely.
On the morrow I'll be awake enough to see if dreams come true.
Did you bring me here to sup?
What weapon?
Plan on carrying some away in a kettle?
I'll try.
You'll do it because I am you liege and I command you to do it!
What's the matter?
I'll go search for it.
I'm not its master.
Your command is my wish, Princess Lili.
I was bewitched... it's better this way...
The moon herself would hide behind a cloud rather than dare comparison with you...
The sight of you makes flowers seem like dross.  All the heavenly angels must envy your grace.
Aye.  And it is the trouble befallen us that brings me here.  I entreat you to tell me the cause of our surrounding sorrow, most lovely of the lovely.
A unicorn's been slain.  The last stallion in all the country.
And as barren of love as stone.
Be fair, Oona.
Bah!  You faeries have the morals of ferrets.
I'm sending you back to Hell!
He was there and then he wasn't!
Mom said I should.
I would have anyway.
I'd be more comfortable if you hadn't slept with Josh.  And George would be more comfortable if he weren't dying.
I want you to try something with me, okay?
No thanks.
What?
George just never really...aimed that high.  Even with not hitting a rabbit.  I knew you were doing that, by the way. That's why I stopped doing it with you. You were no fun.  It was always like you were frightened.  Quiet and boring.
What are you on?
how much weight have you lost?
How's your wife?
She's out with a friend.
She didn't really say.
I know what the deal is.  Josh is a pimp. I'm not stupid.
No.
I'll apologize for everything but today...Today I give a shit.
The gloves on the table are for you.
Sit down for a second.
I'm telling you now.
I'd be in Tahoe having fun if you had given up.
Getting high, I guess.
I haven't used anything for two days. I'm trying.
Don't be.  And hide whatever that new drug is you have.  I like it.
Here.
I know there's an explanation.
He doesn't answer.
He's not spending the entire summer with another kid in Tahoe.  If he leaves, I will follow him up there and I will drag him home by his nose ring.  He can hate me.  You can hate me.  He can try to kill me while I sleep.  You can call the police.  You can call your husband or your attorney, but Sam is spending the summer with me.  He's my son.  He's sixteen.  That's it.
You're not well.
How much time do they get to spend with their dad?
I'm an idiot to have you up there.
His father is a man.
I know.
Hey.
It's not ours.  It's George's.
Not all day.  I'll be home after lunch.
Hell with him. It ain't that.
That's alright, boss. Takes a lot more than a colorful brochure to hurt my feelings.
Over forty years now. Me and Ray Gibson out there.
Claude. Here's to your new job down at the bank. I always knew you'd make something of yourself.
Good old Monroe.
Don't Uncle Claude me. You get a load of those crackers? Couldn't be a mouthful of teeth among the bunch of 'em. Why you want to pick a fight with people like that for?
What'd you say?
Life?! What's life mean? There's no way I can do life. I got a job starts Monday morning!
Gimme that. That doesn't concern you.
Say what?
The hell you talking about? What train?
I'm not gonna let it go. The man needs to explain himself. Makin' promises.
You haven't driven in 40 years, you ain't even got a license. Man's taking his life in his hands, putting you behind the wheel! Where you taking him?
Shh! Is that so hard to believe?
You don't want to hear it, you don't want to hear it. There's no shame in that.
Never thought I'd hear Ray Gibson say that. Hell with you then. You'd only slow me down anyway.
You killed Santa Claus?
That's right. We don't need no fences, we have the gun line. It runs from shack to shack clear around the yard. You are now inside the gun line...
What happened to 'em after that, Willie?
Don't argue with me. You need it more than I do. I know how a little money can help in a place like this.
Excuse me, sheriff. As we explained to your associate here, there's been a mistake. We didn't kill anybody. Now, as for the bootlegging, we happen to work for a very important man in New York.
Satchmo.
That's Natchez-under-the-Hill.
Green's the only color that matters under the hill. They got gambling, girls. You oughta check it out.
Let her go.
All right. Let me out.
You mother...
Try four and a half. At first I totally didn't like him.
We can see what's going on anywhere on Earth. Look.
I can't screw.  I can't screw.
I think we have to work on narrowing down our list of suspects. Now I'm going to go check in with some of my contacts uptown.
Oh, and don't forget, you're shoving a pineapple up Hitler's ass at four o'clock.
How bad?
That's a pretty brassiere.
Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
You got it.
By she, do you mean he?
Little nervous. Wanna puke.
Dude, it's us. Let us in.
School?
What's that pleasant smell coming from, your skin?
Next time. Tonight, I want to share the most beautiful thing I could possibly imagine.
A black guy?
Anything to eat?
Just the face.
Well... you can't have them all.
No, Holly -- wait! He's running. Tell them the rest!
Holly. Holly! Please... The other Sandman. Remember the one who came after --
You know.
All right.
Where? Sanctuary? Can you take me there?
All right. But why? I didn't kill the Runner.
That's nothing... there's a Sandman behind us, too and there'll be more soon. Take me to them.
Then -- why don't you leave me -- go to them -- explain
Sooner or later, we'll have to try something.
It could be...
I don't know.
No.
I have always been here...
Gracious... no.
I promise. We'll go on as soon as it's light.
Texaco... What's wrong with that?
You gotta be kiddin'... This is the boulevard... You can't hear yourself think.
I forgot. Anyway, I hate the idea of acting paranoid.
Yeah.
Are you positive he knows?
So what do we do?
We should stop seeing each other.
We gotta get the stuff and get out of here.
I gotta headache... What's goin' on?
Yeah? what did they want?
But I don't remember anything. What did you tell 'em?
Warden, it's not him. It was not Fred Madison in that cell.
I don't know. The guards say they've never seen him before.
He's in the infirmary, being examined.
He... He can't talk. it appears as if he can't talk, anyway.
I've got men searching the building and the grounds now.
No... I don't. Why?
Let's have a look at the hallway outside the bedroom.
I like to laugh, Fred.
Wake me up when you get home.
Thanks, guys.
How could I miss it? The TV won't quit with that stuff.
Andy's from Utah. He says there you have a choice... You can die by hanging or by firing squad.
Okay.
I don't know.
What night?
I don't remember... What happened that night?
Whatiya mean?
Oh, read it!
This is the only thing I was able to save when those heathens surrounded me.
You see, from this vertebrae I shall be able to reconstruct the entire skeleton.
It was the vertebrae of a Megatherium - found in Asia.
Sir Henry Derwent was knighted, and he never got beyond the mesozoic era.
I just feel as though I'm being made ready for the executioner.
Horns? What kind of horns?
Please! Please! Do not wait for me! I eat so very little.
Look, Bob!
They were.
Centuries.
Of course we have no money as you know it. We do not buy or sell or seek personal fortunes because, well, because there is no uncertain future here for which to accumulate it.
The High Lama! Who in blazes is he?!
Hey!
Right, Bob.
It's not knowing that's so awful, Bob. Not knowing where you're going, or why, or what's waiting when you get there.
Porters?
Why - I'm sorry - but I
I don't believe it! I don't believe a word of it!
In for what?
You mean to tell me you're not going to do anything until we land?
Why, you - you Look here - he may dash us to pieces!
Oh, you're going to make life very simple.
English!
It's not even a fucking door.
Yes, sir.
Don't worry about it.  It's been a long night.  Speaking of which-- you owe me a cup of coffee, remember?
We wear black.
It's an Edna named after Zed's ex wife.  All you do is at the target. The scope matches the image with the image on your retina. The barrel will find the target on its own.
We're rising.
Well, if the bugs have hatched, and they're not here... then where are they?
You know, there's something we never really thought of...
It would've had to have been recently-- within a few weeks.
How could it not?
Come on now.  People are smart.
Tell us the truth.  You don't just find these things, at least not in this neighborhood.
Fine.  Good.
I got a planet check on that bug.  It's from way the hell out in the third belt. it's organic, formed in the same blast that made our solar system.
Forget that guy --
Who wanted her little girl back?
She died?
She's still alive?
We know each other?
This is the official composite of the three precogs?
Show me just Agatha's data stream.
Lamar, I'm sorry.  I don't know what --
I just wanted to congratulate you. You did it.  You've created a world without murder.  So what if you had to kill someone to do it.
Send a DCPD blue & white out there, set up a perimeter and tell 'em we're en route.  What's our confirmed time?
Sure, Chief.  I think I'll grab one for myself while I'm at it...
Why don't you cut the cute act, Danny, and tell me exactly what it is you're looking for?
There hasn't been a murder in six years.  There's nothing wrong with the system.  It's perfect.
There's no way of knowing for sure. She could've forgotten whatever it is you're looking for...
That's great.
I put him in a barrel and sunk him in the bay.
I'm... not... a... killer.
He's dead, Lara.
Nothing.  I didn't kill him.
Lara, I don't know why this is happening.  I just know they're setting me up.  I can't trust anybody.  I don't know who to talk to or where to go...  Lara?  Are you there?
I'll be right there.
I don't understand --
People have gotten the message.  Gum?
I don't know, why?
They could have been put away. Anderton could have found them.
I was a Treasury Agent for eight years.  Why?
I forgot my glasses.
What does he want with a precog?
But there's still the other two.
What happened? I thought we were playing Truth or Dare.
Will you paint the damn thing. Why do you gotta be such a baby.
Don't get my hopes up. If I quit, what then? I can't go through this again.
Nah, man. He's just making contact. That's our man. The Welsh guy.
Ruiz don't like using names on cell phones. He refers to him as the Red Dragon.
To be honest, man, I don't know shit either. All I know is it ain't drugs and it ain't now.
How 'bout this. If you're in, he's in.
You're ready to move up. Christ, the way you busted up the place, you're doing worse already. May as well get paid instead of punished.
Do me a favor. Think about it. Is that too much too ask?
Tom, the Welsh dude --
Ricky's taken care of.
Yeah, he's getting there on his own.
We'll kill Fairfax this year.
Fuck him.
What are we delivering?
Who is this fucking Ruiz?
Some Mexican? How much could he weigh? A buck fifty, tops? I'd kick his fucking ass.
Why do you always get stuck taking care of the kid.
It's not even yours.
Maybe we should call for a cab.
Like I said, I don't know.
You would think.
C'mon, man...
Hey, Jimmy, where they taking us?
Fuck...
Yeah, uh, what's the movie?
Ugh...
Yeah, sure. How much are they?
The videos.
I don't fuck with those crazy, off- the-boat fuckin Irish. You heard of the Westies?.
Jimmy? Ruiz. Pick up Maxie's guineas at LUNA and bring them to Spa.  Jimmy's bringing the car around. Me and Ho rode sleds. We'll meet you at Spa in the VIP room.
Go ahead. Open the fuckin things. You should each find fifteen hundred --
Four mimosas.  You'll love them. So here's the plan. I didn't say shit to Maxie, cause the man has acute angina, and I don't want to get him all worked up.
Bet you like that shit.
When they want your ass, won't nothing keep you out.
Heard where?
I'm working on it.
That's what it is. Walk on out.
Now.
Let it burn. Maybe you'll hear me then.
The first men on earth were black. They ruled and there was not one white face anywhere. But they teach us that we lived in caves and swung from trees. Black men were never like that.
"I'm telling you God's words, not to hustle."
If you want to tell me.
Just hold me.
Hush your mouth.
You're with me even when you're away.
Don't answer the phone. It's all right. It's all right. Nothing is gonna happen to anybody.
At the Hilton. The girls asleep?
I don't think that's such a good idea.
But we do know that the people of that region of Asia Minor, from the Tigris-Euphrates valley to the Mediterranean, are dark-skinned people. I've studied drawings and photographs and seen newsreels. I have never seen a native of that area who was not black.
I'm not saying anything, preacher. I'm proving to you that God is black.
If she got eyes, she do.
500.
Brother Malcolm, I want you to meet Brother Earl. He just joined the Nation.
Well, bitch you move too slow.
Tell him about Baldy.
Brothers of Brother Johnson.
So you are going to talk me to death.
Then I hope the one who gets me has got lots of kids. What do you want?
My deal is with Rosanna. I knew you guys were up to something. Are you two fucking?
Liar. Just tell me who the bank card belongs to. Name and address.
I'm not... easy.
How do I contact you? We still don't have the ATM info.
[Yeah, I've got to get used to the routes. I -- It won't happen again.]
[So am I, Sister.]
[Not for a long time, sister.]
[Romans, chapter 12, verse 21.]
[I want you.]
[Your brother wants to talk to you.]
Nine millimeter. A Sig Sauer 226.
You're crazy. People would hire a has-been, Ray? A drunk?
And what if, just say, there was a kidnap attempt?
I know it's old fashioned, but it's reliable. Like us.
It wasn't a school like yours and there was no Sister Anna.
Being unhappy is a state of mind. I never thought about it.
Yes.
It's not too bad. Will it take a long time before it's better? Our big swim meet is in three weeks. Interschools. I was going to swim in the one hundred meter freestyle.
I know you're not.
Never.
Stay here. If you do something stupid, we won't get her back.
When?
Do you have any family, Mr. Creasy?
[It's a moral issue. On one hand you're cleaning up the bad guys, but in another way we are feeding the problem that produces bad guys.]
She's all right, Andy. It's just that I get one Saturday night off every three weeks, and I was expecting something better, that's all.
You told me that she was a little tall, but that she wasn't bad looking at all.
All right, I'm having a fair time. It's just that I get one Saturday night off in three weeks, and I wanted to wind up with something tonight.
Oh, I couldn't eat nothing. My mother just stuffed me right up to the jaws.
It's her baby too, you know.
Well, it ain't your baby.
You told me.
What happen?
Benjamin Franklin High School.
No, thank you. I don't think I should stay very long.
It's a very sad business, I tell you. A woman, fifty-six years old, all her life, she had her own home. Now she's just an old lady, sleeping on her daughter-in-law's couch. It's a curse to be a mother, I tell you. Your children grow up and then what is left for you to do? What is a mother's life but her children? It is a very cruel thing when your son has no place for you in his home.
Hobby! What can she do? She cooks and she cleans. You gotta have a house to clean. You gotta have children to cook for. These are the terrible years for a woman, the terrible years.
Boy, that Mickey Spillane, he sure can write.
Marty, Thomas and Virginia are here. They had another fight with your Aunt Catherine. So they ask me, would it be all right if Catherine come to live with us. So I said, all right with me, but we have to ask you. Marty, she's a lonely old lady. Nobody wants her. Everybody's throwing her outta their house...
You gotta good heart.
Sure.
Hey, Louise, I want you to meet Marty Pilletti. Marty, that's Louise Kelly, inna back seat there.
Oh, Marty, thanks a lot. That really takes a load offa my mind.
Sure, sure.
I don't care about the intention. I just know your Cross Action is a plus on our side. I've seen it come through four times.
How you, Radar?
There's only one way.
You make a mean martini, kid.
The spot we picked to spend the winter. Maybe we ought to look a little harder.
You met him. Walt Waldowski, the Dental Officer.
All three of us played for our schools. And there are at least four other guys...
Plus running the opium concession for the whole Eighth Army.
Shut up or I'll tear you apart.
I though you said we didn't have a drop.
An eternal damnation.
Your high school friend who went around saying 'Me lay, you lay?' to all the young females in the community. As I remember, you said it was quite a successful approach.
I don't get it.
What do we do?
Be kind of rough on him if there's no blood. Why don't we close up and sit on him a couple of days?
I think we could still have a chance.
No, let's stick to that strategy till we see whether you boys can do two things. The first is get that halfback out of the game. He had one year with the Rams before the Army got him, but he didn't play too often because he's one of those hot dogs.
You think he won't.
I'm fond of Painless, and I'd feel terrible if anything happened to him...
I'd be crazy to think my virtue, such as it is, was more important than his life...
I have but well, you know, I've been mainly an anesthetist a long time now and... well, I'd like you guys to take a look at him.
Well, one of the girls got careless and two days ago she gave birth to an eight-pound American-Japanese male.
Every time we feed him, it either comes right back up or he coughs and turns blue and has a hell of a time.
Big day. Two jaws to rebuild.
That's all the commitment you're offering me?  Or do you have some more extravagant gesture of cooperation?
I don't know. I must have lost my punch. I didn't think the son-of-a- bitch would get up.
They can't do that to me!
But it's ten-thirty at night. We can't get military personnel out for a civilian. A foreign civilian.
Can't. I'm feeling too good.
With all of it?
Oh, crabby guy, huh?
Well, a tall handsome Ubangi, I suppose.
No, no, nothat's your seat.
Father's . . . I never knew he had a diary.
You bet I will, Ma.
Holy smokes! Wasting my time listening to this mad woman.
I got it all ready. Here.
You shouldn't have gotten out of bed, Miss.
No.
I ain't seen him for a week.
He's watching the other door.
Both of 'em?
I don't know how you're gonna stand it around here till after Christmas.
It must be some kind of a gag.
A gag. A gag!
John Doe Club?
Shut up! If you weren't drunk I'd
No.
Yeah. Me and a friend of mine. He's outside.
Uh-huh.
Hello, Roper. Glad you could join us.
May I come in? I would just like to ask you a couple of questions.
You can't help me, man.
Am I gettin' the car?
We ran a search on relatives. He has a cousin in town -- Clarence Teal. Smalltime thief. Last known address was on Pine Street. He moved out a month ago. We've got a couple leads on him to check out.
Being faxed over now.
Roper...
Roper, we're into it...
Yeah.
I'll worry about that. Let's get on with it.
Not the ones I'm at.
Then get out of my face you worthless piece of frogshit.
I do.
Police corruption. It's everywhere.
Only that floor.
Don't know. She keeps screaming to stay out. He keeps screaming to stay out. We decided to stay out.
Hey yourself. Came by to see Troy.
I'm not drunk. Yet.
You heard.
It's okay. We broke up.
Just now.
Scottie...
He says, "Thank you very much."  I'll discuss it with him right now... Good-bye, Chief.
Yes.
-- Two million people lost in the digital night.  What do they seek?
I'm serious, how did you know my name?
No.
Yes, so which one of us does that make the coward?
Of course the legend would like to think that.  But no one has keys.  Your maze was run.
-- Come on, you know F.C.O. regs. Anyone caught with their R and D hand in the bio-digitization cookie jar spends the rest of their life in federal penitentiary.  It's not worth it.
Try harder.
Then where is she?
That's not possible.  No one can do that.
Of course you do.  And the only shot you've got of keeping your ass from sinking in a sea of shit is to tell me where you got this program.
Access established.
Uplink selected.
The only way to obtain the power is to achieve the highest state of being...
OUR SEMI-CONDUCTORS ARE DOWN!
... I just pray we're not too late.
This guy is messing with the wrong teenagers!
WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE!!
By learning the ancient art of Ninjetti.  It is the Genesis of what you on earth have come to know as the Ninja.  It is the perfect union of mind, body and spirit.
Yes, well, I suppose you'd know a little something about that.  Not to worry.  I'll ever so gently lure them in and mold them into an army of devils!  And what better way to entice them ... than with a little Ivan's Ooze?!
Well, if I did I certainly wouldn't say it to you!
NINJA FALCON ZORD!
Tell me something, Meyer. How can you get up at dawn to walk on the beach if you're on your honeymoon?
Hey, I ignore my wife too. But on our honeymoon I paid attention.
Not another word.
Precisely. We are the true entrepreneurs, and Prohibition is the greatest opportunity we shall ever have. America is begging to be taken like an overripe virgin, but they're still fighting over the crumbs of Little Italy.
An intelligent plan, Mr. Luciano, but listen to me well. It can be ruined in a single careless moment. Keep your feet on the ground and your high opinion of yourself under your hat.
Who hired the bastard?
I can just imagine.
For being a bootlegger?
It always is.
Without us, Masseria don't stand a chance, and he knows it.
Come on. Tell us, Shitface.
Calculated risks. But Boss, this one don't calculate.
The kid just called me stupid.
Shit. When I was comin' up, bein' fat meant ya had somethin' ta eat. Guy looked like you, people felt sorry for 'em. Right, Gerardo?
What about the share.
I got partners.
And the Jews?
Masseria's been after me too.
We were overdue to get hit.
We can operate around these guys.
Okay. I'm listening.
If it comes to that. Yeah.
Oh, poor Buster. He hasn't been fed in a day and a half. Let me get some food...
Uhh - martini?
Olive. - Where exactly am I?
Stu Miley.
Can you give me a realistic idea...of how long this is going to last?
Honey, I have to clarify this. The thing is, Dr. Edelstein, my brother has an absolute <u>horror</u> of doctors - hospitals - needles - all of it -
He's stuck in a loop - a nightmare loop. <i></i> Anybody here know what Oneirix is?
Oh, right. Cheating Death. There's <u>one thing</u> you might try. Only one guy in <u>history</u> ever pulled it off. Well, actually two. Actually, no, there was that other guy who...well, <u>very few people</u> have done it.
I'm heading in to work, baby. Are you sure you'll be okay?
They only made the one episode. They've shown it about nineteen times.
I'd better go report this...
Kitty...<u>my</u> situation is really not important. The thing is, my girlfriend is now living with, and possibly engaged to, a demented monkey.
Listen to me! Is there any way I can <u>warn</u> her what Monkeybone is up to??
Maybe he wanted to pick out his own casket?
I don't <u>know</u>.
That's New York.  It looks rundown, but it's safe during the day.  You'll get used to it.
Mm hmm.
Goodbye, sweetheart.
Daniel Webster? Sat here? Say--that man was a great orator.
Not me, sonny. I'm just going to sit around and listen.  What's this?
Where's the Majority Leader?
Uh-huh. And where's the Press Galery?
Oh, yes--they're fine people--regular people.
Those busts up there--all around the wall--who are they, sonny?
Thanks very much, sonny--
Here--let me give you a Boy Ranger button.
Hey--you're into me for a buck already. I say--McGann. Shoot the whole dollar.
What do I play?
Frankly, kid--are you goofy?
Kid--he thinks he's talking to that mob at home, but not a line we've written--not a word he's said from that floor has gotten into that home State.
Not a word! Taylor's sewed up every paper. They're tossing out everything that comes in over the wires!
Relax, Happy. Jim said to wait.
*You* tell Jim Taylor.
Jim--when the lightning hit, I--I just--
Oh--Jim!
What stuff?
When Jeff gets through with Taylor--  Quiet! What do you mean by breaking in here--? Get out! Get *out* of here!
I yield.
He has imputed to me conduct unworthy a Senator--and I demand he be made to yield the floor--!
I *did* see Taylor! And I was in that room!
Like what, Mr. Taylor?
Yes, so I was told, Mr. Taylor, but--
What is your interest in this, Mr. Taylor?
You *couldn't*?
*Who*! Miss--! Is that--? Why didn't you--? Holy smoke;  H-hello... Yes, Miss Paine... How-- how are you, Miss Paine...? What?... Escort *you* Gee--I mean--*sure*-- *yes*! I'd be--. Reception for a *princess*! Gosh!... Thanks, Miss Paine. Yes. I--I'll be there! Goodbye, Miss Paine.  Did you hear that?--Escort Susan Paine--reception for a princess! Imagine her calling me--asking *me*-- !
Wow!
Well--for a couple of years now--I-- I've thought it would be a wonderful thing to have a National Boys' Camp out in our State--
You see--if we could take the poor kids off the streets--out of cities-- a few months in the summer--learn something about Nature and American ideals--
I--I'm sorry, sir. I--I have a bill--
Oh--nothing--nothing. My idea is-- for the Government to lend us the money--and the boys'll pay it back-- sending in a penny or a nickel--no more than a dime--no, gosh--the Government's got enough on its hands without--
What's the matter?
Saunders--it's going to go pretty bad for Jeff tomorrow. There's only one thing that can be done for him now--  I--I've written his resignation. He resigns under protest--denying all charges. No one will ever be sure if he was guilty or not. It leaves him with at least a shred of honor. The other way--branded openly in the Senate--expelled--he'll never live it down. Rather a simple compromise than utter ruin. In a year--the whole thing might be forgotten--
Yes--
He's lost complete faith in me--
But--you love him, don't you, Saunders?
Do you?
I thought I could, too.  *My* business--this fine future! I have no future I *care* about, if this boy is broken! I--I can't sleep. The only important thing in my life now is to save what I can for him. I want him to get a start again--I'll see that he's taken care of as long as he lives--!  Saunders--whether you ever mean anything to him or not--
It's too late now--it's *impossible*!
Sure! The fight's in the open now-- to a finish--!
He won't get started! I'll *make* public opinion out there in five hours. I've done it all my life! I'll blacken this punk until--  Joe--your job is back in the Senate-- keep those men fighting him *there*.
Keep doing it! This is the whole works, Joe--we're out of business of bigger than we then we ever were. We can't miss a trick--we can't stop at *anything*--till this yokel's smashed up and buried so deep he'll never--!
Order!
Who's that?
Oh, yes - Deeds. Fine fellow. Very democratic. You won't have no trouble at all. Talk to anybody.
Yes, indeedy.
What's that got to do with it?
What's that got to do with it?
Yes!!!
What did they say?
What did they say?
What are they going to do?
I'm from a small town too, you know.
Probably as small as Mandrake Falls.
Are you? When?
I don't blame you.
Tell him I had to leave suddenly. I got a job in China - some place.
What else can I do? Keeping this up is no good. He's bound to find out sometime.  At least I can save him that .
I'm going to tell him the truth.
I'm having lunch with him today. He expects an answer. It's going to be pretty.
John
Perfect! Perfect!
Thank you. Now don't touch a thing. Leave everything as it is.
Mr. Cedar!
I'll tell those mugs to keep their shirts on, that you'll be right down.
No, thank you.
Why should you?
Nah.
"There once was a man named Cobb, Who kept Semple away from the mob. Came the turn of the tide And Semple - he died - And now poor Cobb's out of a job!"
Huh?
Oh, I don't mean that. I'm sure I'm going to need your help.
They'd call you anything if you gave them half a chance. They've got you down as a sap.
No, you don't! Get this clear: Socking people is no solution for anything.
Not editors. Take my word for it. Not editors!
Listen. Listen, Longfellow. You've got brains, kid. You'll get along swell if you'll only curb your homicidal instincts - and keep your trap shut. Don't talk to anybody! These newshounds are out gunning for you.
That's my job. I'll take care of that. I'll keep that stuff out of the papers - if you'll help me. But I can't do anything if you go around talking to people. Will you promise me to be careful from now on?
Thank you.  If you feel the building rock, it'll be me blasting into this editor.
Well, then, we must give the wrong kind of shows.
You'll excuse me, won't you? I'll be right back.
You mean to tell me you don't carry a pocketful around with you?
Be sure and point 'em out to me, won't you?
I'm a writer myself, you know.
Don't pay any attention to her.
Now you keep out of this!
Excuse me. What did you say?
What, sir?
Take your time.
...And I from Phyllis.
How do you mean?
It's a thought I had.
Nope.
Salad nicoise? I love salad nicoise.
Yeah.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
You've got to have the right ladder for the job. You don't know what you're doing, you can get yourself in trouble.
There's something I think we need to talk about.
Back when this started, was there anything unusual happening in your life? A change of job, of living situation... a loss of some kind?
Hmm.
Hmm, as in -- that's interesting. Sometimes, with enough clues, it's possible to figure these things out.
I don't know what's real and what isn't. That's never been my strong suit. But if you're tired all the time and you've had to give up the life you were having and come back home when you didn't want to... that's worth trying to fix. Maybe I can help you do that.
We... we would try several things. But I need to see you a lot.
I'll come to you. We'll try a little walking.
Yes, yes, and definitely yes. Also... I get confused.
Where?
Yeah?
That's... good?
I don't know if --
Of course.
But...
I know it! Please believe me, I know that...
Uh-huh.
I understand.
Don't tell me, 'cause I'm not going to tell you what I've got.
I'm impressed. I couldn't make three million dollars if I lived three lifetimes.
-- Skip. Knowing what you do about me --
Everybody has a story, Skip.
What it felt like was... a series of separate, unconnected lives -- hillbilly kid, wrecked college boy, garbage man, civil service guy...  ...et cetera... et cetera. Every time I'd leave a life, it felt good. Whatever problems I was having were suddenly gone. I had no friends and I didn't talk to my family. The only constant, stabilizing force in my life was... drugs.
It wasn't the best situation.
Didn't need one. We didn't even need a warrant for most of the shit we did. Man, the IRS... we could go in your bank account, your credit cards... hell, we used to go into doctors' files and get all the juicy details. Nobody wants to argue with the IRS.
I'm honored.
You're completely reliable.
Oh, yeah, very tough. But I guess that's good... to keep out the quacks.
Wallace Franklin... from Greensburg.
Shut-up and gimme your bandolier.
I've had worse.
Oh yes, always.
Yes. No one has ever had so much, been so close. We must stop her, or it will be the end of us all.
And burn the map and retrieve the key.
Forget the bumbling Americans, they will be like all the others. Without the map to guide them, how can they possibly find Hamunaptra?
Yeah, get me a glass of bourbon, a shot of bourbon and a bourbon chaser.
No.
No... You came to ask me about Hamunaptra.
Ahmar is Ossirion. "Passageway to the underworld", actually.
Why would they bury somebody in the ceiling?
No. I've never seen a mummy look like this. He's, he's still...
Got what?
I was mistaken.
I lie to everybody, what makes you so special?
That just makes you more gullible.
Picked his pocket, actually.
Read the inscription on the cover!
We'll sneak up and steal that book right out from under them.
And then he'll be coming after Evy.
Head hunting.
Then Captain Amazing appeared.
Me, too.
Doctor Heller?
It's me... Elizabeth.
Thanks.
He's dead.
You're dead.
You're a spy.
I saw him walk you home.
Roy.
I just want to be a superhero.
The wise snake coils before he strikes.
How could I see him if he's invisible?
With what?
Shhh.
Normal. What's normal? Does normal exist? And if it did, how would we know it?
Ow.
Sorry.
But how do we get in?
I have no doubt that he has, Your Majesty, but does he have any strong moves from which to choose?
Your Majesty has grasped the outlines of his problem in much less time than it took me.  This is a crucial point -- and it is a political one, which Your Majesty will be in a far better position to answer than I.  Can Napoleon afford to abandon Moscow without signing even the preliminaries of a peace treaty with you?
Perhaps it would be even more serious than that, Your Majesty. His European confederation is held together by some very slender threads.  Your Majesty knows even better than I that Austria and Prussia are very doubtful allies, and the Emperor has reason enough to fear that they will turn on him, at the first sign of weakness.
If I can presume to go into the Emperor's mind, I believe that he has based his entire campaign strategy on obtaining a peace treaty after the fall of Moscow.  When Vienna fell, there was a peace treaty.  When Berlin fell, another treaty.  That has always been the rules of the game.  But what is he to do now if no treaty is forth- coming?  He knows that beyond Moscow, there is nothing, and that, if he withdraws, there remains only a fall into emptiness.
A treaty?  Don't be ridiculous. What treaty is this?  Who made it? Who has been giving orders?
But who made this treaty?
Who sent my wife and son out of Paris?
And where is Joseph?
What cowardice!  What treason! Joseph has ruined everything.  How could they all lose their heads. They knew I was coming up fast. Victory was just within grasp. Come, come, turn your troops around, General Belliard.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you, sir.  I will do that.
I fear our meeting is long overdue... Napoleon.
You have made such excellent use of it; I should think you will hate to leave it.
Yes -- an excellent idea.
To Citizen General Bonaparte from one who does not wish to see him dishonored by his wife.  You should know, Citizen General, that your wife has taken a lover, one Captain Hippolyte Charles... undated and unsigned.
I thought I was.  I was confused.
Now, I know that I shall die if you leave me.
Yes.
There's probably some explanation.
My regrets, my dear Major, but I believe you have been blocking the road.
No, Major, I merely wish to state that your vehicle appears to be somewhat slower and heavier than mine, and point out that, if you would be kind enough to pull over to one side of the road, I could pass you and be on my way.
Before you quote the rules of the road to me, Major, may I point out to you that you are not in France now, but that you are a guest in Russia.
If you wish to put things on that basis, then I will say good day to you, monsieur.
Monsieur Varlac, do not pretend to speak for these good people whom you have misled and inflamed with violent speech.  Now, I order you to come down from the cart.
Duroc, I have a bill here for 600,000 francs from Tirot, for building the Imperial throne and six decorated arm-chairs.  The amount is absurd -- and, at least twice too much.
Good.
I don't know... I think he went out the back.
What about the dog?
Oh, yeah, where you work at?
Thanks for reminding me.
Damn...how much money ya'll got left from the lottery?
Out the door and to the left.
Wait for what?
It's locked.
I fell in some mud.  Now hurry up!
Yeah, pops!
I feel you.  I've just been practicing that one move all week.  I thought that was it.
R-U-S-H Intensely.
Ya'll live around here?
Nothing.
Yeah, I got a urgent message for a customer named William Jones.  Drop everything, Craig is in trouble.  Come quick.  Don't try to call.
I got my mase.
It's an important speech.
Oh, yeah?
Indeed.
Good.
That's right, I killed him. He fucked up one too many times so I put a bullet in his eye. Then I put two more into him just to make sure. Now that was somebody I loved.
Well, you can trust Eleanor Samara Grant.
On TV.
I'm just an accountant.
I'm sorry. You understand I don't mind dying if I could save my daughter. I mean that.
What are you going to do?
I think this is worth a dollar.
Not very far, honey-pie. Not far at all.
Where?
No.
He carried on some; kicked.
Ain't nobody stole Dad's skiff.
She went.
Sshhh! He's in there.
Icey, I don't want a husband.
How?
What!
John! Don't!
That's Daddy!
Is that all?
Yonder.
Why, sure. And there's fried chicken and candied sweets and cornsticks and apple cobbler!
Naturally.
Yes. But first of all we'll have a little talk.
I reckon it's been ordained this way, Brother Spoon.
A scrawl. On a piece of notepaper on the bureau.
How'do.
Now who was this?
He must have wanted somethin', Ruby. A man don't waste time on a girl unless he gets something.
R.E.M.'s. Rapid eye movements. The eyes follow the dream -- their movement picks up on this --
Slept like a rock.
No.
One two, Freddie's coming for you? No. Rod killed Tina. He's a fruitcake and you know it.
I believe in you, me, and Rock and Roll. And I'm not too sure about you lately.
I heard your ma went ape at the security store today. You look like the Prisoner of Zenda or something. How long's it been since you slept?
Who?
You do?
Hi daddy. I know what happened.
You know he's dead though, right?
Krueger.
No, Mother. Yes, Mother. No, Mother.
Yes, Mother. G'night.
I do want to know. He's not dead and gone -- he's after me and if I sleep he'll get me! I've got to know!
The door was locked from your side.
Rod and I are done. He's too much of a maniac.
Too bad... you missed an inspiring day, Anna.
A few friends... just a little dinner party.
An omelet.
Well, I've saved up two eggs and each of my friends is bringing his own so we'll manage.
Imagine! The niece of the Czar opening the door for us.
Right now it's on the balcony.
Leon, how would you like to have three lifelong friends?
Which part of the room is mine?
Don't ask for it, Ninotchka. There is a Turkish proverb which says, "If something smells bad, why put your nose in it?"
With our cream situation what it is, it is Russia which should apologize to the cats.
Shall I draw your bath, sir?
That's perfect!
Oh, Leon, you are so good.
...it is in the air... it may come around the corner as you walk down the street....
Comrade.
Comrade.
Oh, yes, but have you a safe here big enough to hold this?
That's even better.
It's a hat, Comrade, a woman's hat.
Don't make it difficult for me. This is no more a pleasure trip for me than it is for you.
Go ahead.
Oh, my barbaric Ninotchka. My impossible, unromantic, statistical...
Yes.
Yes.
There have been cases... but the headache the next morning is worth while -- if you drink it with the right toast.  To us, Ninotchka!
I know... it's the Russian soul.
So -- you're behind all this. I should have known.
It looks pretty hopeless... there may be a chance... that's all... The French Government has recognized Soviet Russia and he doubts that they will risk a war for my poor sake. He might be able to make up some kind of a case but it would cost money, money, money!... That's all they are interested in -- those lawyers!
Hello.
I told you to go, madame.
But, madame! If you don't think about food what do you think about?
That also is a question of food, madame. I'll bring you a nice little lunch  la Pre Mathieu. 
Frankly, sir, it stinks.  I have no access.  I'm lucky Helms lets me have a staff.
He's nervous, sir.  He's heard you're looking for a new director.
That's Helms.  He's "sang froid," a world-class poker player.
John, you don't want to start down that road.  I remember what Whittaker Chambers told me back in '48 -- and he was a man who suffered greatly -- he said, "On the road of the informer, it's always night."  This is beyond you or even me.  It's the country, John.  It's the presidency.
Good.  You know how I feel about loyalty.  I'm not going to let any of my people go to jail.  That I promise you.  The important thing is to keep this away from Haldeman and Ehrlichman. I'm trusting you to do that, John.  I have complete confidence in you.
Mitchell?
I thought the gloves were off.
Sir, Bob and I are gonna have to testify before Earvin's committee.
Executive privilege will make it look like we're covering up.
Cox!  Fire him.
It was just a fishing expedition. Apparently it was their fourth attempt at the DNC.
It's possible they were looking for evidence of an illegal Howard Hughes donation to the Democrats, so the Democrats couldn't make an issue of your Hughes money.
All right.
The Bay of Pigs? ... That was Kennedy's screw-up.  How does that threaten us?
Yes, sir, but ... do you think Gray'll go for it?
He'll need a pretext.  He'll never figure one out for himself.
The only problem with that, sir -- it gets us into obstruction of justice.
How is this national security?
Because he didn't even know about it. The CIA never told him, they just kept it going.  It was like ... it had a life of its own.  Like ... a kind of "beast" that doesn't even know it exists.  It just eats people when it doesn't need 'em anymore.  Two days after the Bay of Pigs, Kennedy called me in.  He reamed my ass ...
What?
Sir?
It's Helms -- it's got to be.
How?
Is it my turn?
You're correct.  I'm concerned these students are being funded by foreign interests, whether they know it or not.  The FBI is worthless in this area.  I want your full concentration on this matter ...
Then find something.  And I want these leaks stopped.  Jack fucking Anderson, the New York Times, the State Department -- I want to know who's talking to them.
Screw congressional oversight.  I know damn well, going back to the '50's, this agency reports what it wants, and buries what it doesn't want Congress to know.  Pay close attention to this.
Edgar, think twice.  He works in the kitchen.
It's between Nixon and a Kennedy again, Edgar ... Who do you want?
I know ...
Party ain't started yet, Dick.  Got these gals coming over to the ranch later for a little private "thing," y'know ... There's some fellows I want you to meet.
Well, goddamn.  Are you threatening me, Dick?
We have to entertain the possibility ...
Just ... uh ... you know.
... but it's not, bottom-line, gonna change a goddamn thing, John.  The question is: How do we screw Ellsberg so bad it puts the fear of God into all leakers?
Sure, I'd like to offer condolences.
Oh, I like satin, I like pink ...
I like jazz ...
Elvis I like, too.
Gentlemen, I go now to discover the exact length, width and depth of the shaft.
You're not going to blame this on Castro, are you?
I suppose Castro staged the whole thing just to beat you.
Do you really want this, Dick?
And then you'll be happy?
You.  What' you're doing --
I wish I knew.  You're hiding.
Whatever it is you've always been hiding.  You're letting it destroy you, Dick.  You won't even ask for help.  You're destroying yourself, Dick.
Whatcha predicting -- your boy Goldwater going to split the party?
The Republican Party was never home to extremists.  You should know better. This guy's as stupid as McCarthy, and McCarthy never did you any good in the long run, now did he?
No ID in her room?
Yessir. We should a brought wieners.
I'm hidin' behind you.
That DEA agent called again. You don't want to talk to him?
He's goin' back out there and he wanted to know if you wanted to go with him.
I ain't got the money.
What little I had is long gone and they's bill aplenty to pay yet. I buried my mother today. I ain't paid for that neither.
...I need to sit down.
Baby, at what point would you quit botherin' to look for your two million dollars?
I'm looking for Llewelyn Moss.
Yes I did.
Where does he work?
Where does he work?
Huh? Airport or airstrip?
Well -- where ya goin'?
Just lightin' out for the territories, huh. Brother, I been there... Well...
I don't know. Will there?
Everything.
You stand to win everything. Call it.
Yessir. I understand that.
Oh. That's who you keep lookin' out the window for?
What else then?
Yeah but no one ever sees that. I like a man that'll tell you he's married.
I do like you.
She's in a kind of shock. I see all the signs of a post-traumatic reaction with possible dissociative symptoms.
It's a type of altered state... it allows a traumatized person to continue functioning.
They no longer live in tepees, Mr. College Graduate.
You bet I did. I got a squad car on the way to the reservation right now.
You just go write your little story, Roy. I'll handle the police work...
No, I didn't have to.
No, just stand there... lemme look at you a minute.
Yes... Not the actor, though, the doctor. I think.
Sue Ann, I thought you of all people would back me up on this, you know what Del's like. How did he take my note?
What are you talking about?
Yes, she is.
She's a good person to know.  So where did you study again?
Alright, okay... I think you broke the record for staying in character about three hours ago.
Why are you screaming at me? I mean, what am I... why am I here? I don't...
No, I... I'll leave. Forgive me if I caused you all any trouble... I just, I don't know how I...  ...I'm sorry.
I came for love...
It's people with no lives watching other people's fake lives.
I don't know.
Los Angeles, California.
Europe? The Europe?  This is my first time out of Kansas.
Did you love it?
'David.' That's your guy. So, you staying with him?
Who?
What? Where was he?!
No, almost never.
Thanks so much. You must get bothered by this kind of thing a lot.
No, that should be more than --
Of what?
I don't follow...
No...
Are we gonna do business here, or not?
A mark, huh?
Well, no one ever spit in my face before. Especially some cracker fuck.
Half.
They paid us half. They still owe us half...
Where? Where is she?
What?
What do you mean?
Mrs. Blaine? I can tell you right now, without a doubt, that your granddaughter is alive, and did not kill Del Sizemore.
I know, George, I was there. I'm not denying that she's good.
We know that...
No, George, we've already done that with Lonnie. The blind one last year, remember?
I don't know, George...
I'll think about it.
I said I'll think about it.
Actually, she was my discovery... just like you.
"Would you like ground pepper on that salad, Ms. Branch?" Remember?
...why do you think you have to be missing a piece of your soul to kill somebody?
What are you talking about? Killing's totally natural. It's dying that isn't natural...
No.  Well, her grandparents are down in Oklahoma, but that's it...
No. But I'm taping her show every day so she can watch it when she comes back.
"A Reason to Love."
Gopher, Everett?
Yeah, let's negotiate 'em, Everett.
Oh sweet Lord, Everett, looka this!
He was never turned into a frog!
Campaign manager? Waldrip.
Just a little change of cast. Me and the little lady are gonna pick up the pieces'n retie the knot, mixaphorically speakin'. You boys're invited, of course. Hell, you're best men! Already got the rings.
Don't I know it.
Pete, the personal rancor reflected in that remark I don't intend to dignify with comment, but I would like to address your general attitude of hopeless negativism. Consider the lilies a the goddamn field, or-hell!- take a look at Delmar here as your paradigm a hope.
Eighty-four years old! I'll be gummin' pab-you-lum!
Well he's the reform candidate, Daddy.
Yes, sir.
I been calling for four months.
Nobody. Just a girl I've been making it with the last couple of weekends.
Yeah, I sort of thought so myself.
Yeah, I know.
That what she was... a Norfolk Deb?
What if I want to talk about her, pard? What then? You know, that's all I've ever heard from you, since I was a kid... you never want to talk about that, man, and it's important.
I don't mean anything by it.
It doesn't matter what he's going through. That's the whole purpose of this zoo. What matters is he freaked out for some reason at twenty-five thousand feet and that can't ever happen again.
Zack, don't!
Now what on earth would give you an idea like that?
One more minute.
You're no better than me, Paula! You're just the same!
He didn't give you much choice.
Where'd you learn to fight like that?
Opening up just a little wouldn't kill you, ya know.
What's stopping you?
No. Is that what you want?
What would you do differently?
Why'd your mom marry that guy if she didn't love him?
Your real father?
Hey, Sid, thanks.
She'll come, pard. A rich socialite Oakie like you oughta be a big catch around these parts.
But she expects you to marry her?
She didn't.
Hurry up, for Christ's sake!
Not that one.
Hey man, it's the neighbor's house, who breaks in through the neighbor's house?!
A guy shows you a gun, Burnham, and you insult him?  Hey, who's the idiot?  Huh?
I met him at the tables, same as you.  And frankly, I'm grateful we have a little muscle right about now.
Different tables.
Close?  Are you insane?  We're nowhere near close!  Fuck this, I'll make an anonymous phone call on Monday, they'll find the floor safe, and I'll inherit the shit.  Little piece of it, anyway, it's better than nothing.
No ball, kid.
I said open the door.
Why?
I don't think so, but I love her album.
The furniture guy?
They're coming in here, aren't they?
Shhh...
Oh, you know, it's uh... it's in the little fridge in your room.
Hey, quit apologizing, you're starting to sound like Grandma. You're not gonna have an attack. Okay?
They mean, Pig!, that the Black Panther Party declares that if you try to brutalize our community or take our weapons.  We are going to shoot you!!!
Brimmer! Could you come in here please?
What? So you can shoot me? Call it resisting arrest?
Brimmer you're fucked up...
Who's they?
Who? I mean besides the FBI?
Yeah, only I figure you'd be the one doing the speaking.
Cut the crap, you've been taking the man's money for years. Now it's time you earned it.
The white power structure wants us to act like savages.  But we're a different kind of animal altogether. We're Panthers. And The Black Panther Party for Self Defense is very painfully aware that America has historically reserved its most barbaric treatment for non-white people since the beginning of the country. So we need to organize, we  keep our shit correct! And effect revolution. We revolve the power into the hands of the people. Where it belongs.  Power to the people baby...
A gun's a gun man. It don't need to be loaded.
Wait a second there brother...
Brimmer.
Yeah.
Yeah... I guess. Any of other Panthers know about this?
Just the legit shit.
Later for that. I'm done either way...
Yes... No... Mom it's not like you think. They're alright. There out there trying to do something.
Mom, black folks been praying to God for four hundred years. Maybe it's time we tried something else...
I don't know. I really don't.
I've just been inside the mind of a genius.  Lord Cornwallis knows more about war than I could in a dozen lifetimes.
His victories at Charleston and Camden were perfect, strategically, tactically, logistically.  But he has a weakness.
Our governor is a bigger fool than I thought.
Very well, proceed, sir.
I will do so as soon as possible.
Thank you.  How's the spotted one's milk?
He tried.  It didn't take.
Full sentences.  As if she had been speaking all along.
As you did at Fort Wilderness?
That's what I'm doing.  I will not fight and because I won't, I will not cast a vote that will send others to fight in my stead.
I'm a parent, I don't have the luxury of principles.
Four, five miles.
Remember Braddock?
Worse.
You'll see soon enough, hon.
Ellie...Ellie...what...
Well, it's always better to take precautions--but I'm sure Church will be all right, honey...
Well, I think Michael McDowell is so full of shit he probably squeaks when he walks, my dear.
Well, but Missus Creed! It ain't quite that way, deah!
Aw, you'll be okay. Less than a mile.
It's going to be dark before we even get where we're going, Louis. But we can do it...and we're going to.
Does she love the cat?
Then come on.
Your cairn.
Well...a touch of the flu...
You don't understand--
She was a little over-excited, that's all. Poor kid.
Jesus, Rachel, what's got into you?
Oh Louis, I just don't know about this--
Louis, are you sure?
Say the name, or I slit your throat.
All right then.
By the powers, you're right!  Where's Jack's pistol?  Who's got it?  Bring it forward!
Then why aren't you eating?
Commodore, you can't do that!
He can locate Isla de Muerta -- but I doubt he'll be willing to help us from the brig.
I'm told that dress is the very latest fashion in London.
I saved your life; now you've saved mine.  We're square.
Now I must hear this song.  An authentic pirate song.  Have at it.
More to drink!
I'm going after the Black Pearl. I know where it's going to be, and I'm going to take it.
Aye, and that's why I know where it's going to be, and that's why I know what Barbossa is up to.  All I need is a crew.
Not if the fool has something Barbossa wants.  Something he needs.
Will -- it'll go worse for us -- for Elizabeth, especially -- if we fight.
Smith.
You threatened Miss Swann.
Commandeer.  We're going to commandeer a ship.  Nautical term.
So's breaking a man out of jail. Face it, Will: you may say you'll never be a pirate, but you're off to a rip-roaring start.  My advice -- smile and enjoy it.
Barbossa.
The Black Pearl is a real ship.
Yes it is.  I've seen it.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes, I have.
... No.
But I've seen a ship with black sails.
... no.
You got it, Dr. Argon.
I suppose you are going to tell me where it is going.
Ain't it.
Now, Icky, I don't need you winding yourself up.  I need you focused and in control.
You don't either.  We won't know anything until we find that guy and find out if he's alive or what.
In the meantime, we're going to need someone to deal with that mess in the lab.  I don't think we should call Dr. Bright.
Nebbleman.
I'm so excited, Icarus.
Excellent.  How long until the assembler tank is complete?
Oh yeah.  They were working on molecular assemblers, too, weren't they?
That's right.  C.D.C. found out and closed them down...
I've only been invited to her house once, but I know there is a basement lab that she uses for private research.
Well, it was good to see you, Daniel, but I have to be going.
It escaped from the lab before we could finish the experiment.
Yes.
Three days ago it was.
With enough exposure, the same thing they do to everything else.
Yeah.  Old times.
Sort of.  We used a process similar to the vulcanization of rubber and added bulk with a chain of chloroprene elastomers.
Yes.
The same thing I suppose.
The question is, are you?
'Paranoia is what separates the secured from the unsecured.'
Decent? Why Miss Schuyler, I want to be noble.
No - give you another guess.
Throw me out - because I'm beginning to get goofy ideas, and they concern you, Anne.
My name is Smith - well, that you seem to have been able to stand for the last month. I'm white, male and over twenty-one. I've never been in jail - that is, not often. And I prefer Scotch to Bourbon. I hate carrots, I hate peas, I like black coffee and I hate garters. I make seventy-five bucks a week and I've got eight hundred and forty-seven bucks in the bank - and - I don't know yet whether your eyes are blue or violet.
Oh, no I won't my dear - oh, no I won't my dear - I'll wash behind my ears, but no I won't my dear!
What are you talking about?
What am I going downstairs and tell those people?
Stewart, would you mind telling me why you're not going?
Mother, I promise you that he won't be a reporter much longer. Once I get him away from that atmosphere and get him away from a man named Gallagher
Is that so?
Excuse me, Gallagher. I wouldn't miss this one for the world.
Now get this, Conroy. My name is Smith. Always was Smith - and always gonna be Smith.
That's so.
I beg your pardon, sir?
Oh, you don't appreciate it. Her pictures don't do her justice. Why, Gallagher, she's queenly - she is queenly - and I know queens!  And oh, has she got herself a nose - and I know noses too. That little snozzle of hers is the berries, I tell you. And is she cute when she throws that little snozzle to the high heavens!
Well, well! If it isn't my old friend! Turn around, gal! Let's get a look at you.
Well, daughter of the slums - how did you get out of the ghetto?
Aw, you wanted to see some life in the raw, huh? Well gal, I'm afraid we ain't got no raw life up here.
No, no! Maybe we could interest you in some well done butterflies, or perhaps some slightly fried pansies, or better still, some stuffed shirts. And guaranteed every one of them will give you a good stiff pain in the neck.
Been where?
Never even been to New Madrid.
Oh - draw on my imagination, I suppose.
We admit nothing. However, I have a little statement all prepared.
And now for that twentieth crack
Oh, so you did give her ten thousand dollars, eh? and there are letters...
The name is Smythe.
Mrs. Schuyler is not at home.
Well, Gallagher, you certainly took no chances, did you?
It can't be possible.
Thanks ... I love you.
I don't know.
No I'm not sweetie.
It is?
Oh, no thanks ...
I'm fine--but thank you.
Um ... Yes I do. Where's our lawyer?
Look it doesn't matter. It's not important.
What happened?
One date, Jen--that's all I'm asking. If you don't go out with this guy we could throw their whole universe out of whack.
What?
What were you doing in a library?
It's okay.
It's fine.
Right here.
I've done the slut thing, David. It's really kinda old.
Hunh?
Scout?
But you don't know how long I've been looking for someone like you.
I am actually ... Glad to see you've finally shown your true colors.
What?
Listen to me!
Hi.
I brought you something ... From the library.
Oh sure. Big fan like yourself. It's the least I could do.
And what was this?
This is "Fly With Us?"
I think that's a type-o then, that would be a mistake.
That's it.
I don't know...I mean: I don't know.
It's fine, but --
I feel really on the spot now.
I don't do that. I don't - things like that.
I'm not being scared, you're just going to rag me if I do this --
I don't know.
What?
I didn't ask him that. He's lying.
No. I'm sorry.
....what....?
Yeah, not really.
Yes. LENA Elizabeth has a picture of you guys -- your sisters and you, it's a lot of family, it must be nice.
No. I'm the exact opposite --
It's terrible, no.
Yeah.
About six months.
Yeah. Yeah we get along well.  You didn't get along with her very well?
No, no. I did.
Yeah.
Yeah?
You were talking about the promotion --
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, no, I see --
That's insane. That is really, really crazy. That's just crazy if you spend three thousand dollars on pudding.
So that was your pudding?
I'm sorry. I thought you said --
I thought you said you bought all that pudding --
Your sister was telling me a pretty funny story about you, when you guys were kids and you were building a ramp for your dog and you threw a hammer through a window? Is that right? You threw a hammer through a sliding glass door?
Yeah.
Did you do it?
You didn't just smash up the bathroom?
Well who did?
You're hand is bleeding.
How?
Sir, a young man saw you coming out of the bathroom.
Why? ...what?
I know.
Why?
I didn't do it.
Yeah, but I didn't do anything.
Please don't do this to me.
Sorry.
....I have seven.
...it just....I don't know....I don't know.
Hi.
What?
I thought Latisha said you would --
It's....whatever....that's not cool.
Will you call me later to talk about asking Walter for the shrink? And we can talk about - he said you have this crying problem or something?
For fuck's sake, who else would it be? The witching hour's arrived; you've alerted the others, yes?
But why heap such ghastly fantasies atop an already ghastly existence?
Why not act the role of heroines instead? Queen Esther from the Bible, or St. Joan?
Mustn't do that, sir.
I don't take my orders from you; not anymore.
You can't --! You mustn't --! I've all the demons of hell in my head; my only salvation is to vent them on paper --
Coulmier, you animal!
Oh, but you must, my pumpkin! Sex without flirtation is merely rape!
I hope you'll judge him by his progress here, and not his past reputation.
You keep strange company, Abbe. But if you truly have matters in hand here --
-- then I've friends of my own to visit.
And my own.
Poorly.
I'm not the first man God has asked to shed blood in His name. I will not be the last.
No, sir. Plainly put, I never expect to sleep again.
Stop, I beg you! Have pity, I say! You're not my lover; you're a monstrous rou!
There's something else I want from you.
Your publisher says I'm not to leave without a new manuscript.
Don't be fooled, Madeleine! He fears for himself. He's like a man starving, and you -- ha! -- you're like a pork chop dolloped with heavy cream --
First and foremost, he's a MAN. You remind him of that fact, and he resents you for it.
Oh, but I am!
It's beyond perversity. That honor should carry a price tag...
You've come to lecture me?
They've put you up to this, haven't they?
You need to get outta here, Rapunzel
Why don't you come down to LA? Stay with us for a while.
Uh-hub.
Yeah
One . . . buys things.
Good. Retain that feeling. Let it nourish you from this day forth. It shall nourish us both
Louella, please, be reasonable, I understand you have problems with Orson's picture but maybe we can work something out--
Oh for God's sake, Louella-
Can I talk to Hearst?
The whole joint is half the size of Rhode Island.
Yeah, it's the place God would have built, if he'd had the money.
Everyone sees someone different. That's what we show.
Like a jewel. Turn it in the light and a different facet is illuminated.
I don't give a shit about-
Yeah, you're probably right.
Again
"Do what you can"?! That's not good enough I
You're with them, aren't you? You're going to bury my movie. They bought you!
Why don't you just have the guts to admit it
It's just that my movie is so-
We done?
What're you, a cop? I'm goin' out -- business.
And where you goin'?
Whadda you care?
No, I'm not afraid. Why? You wanna meet her?
Cause I'll go right over there and bring her here.
You sure you wanna meet her? Don't make me go over there, you change your mind and you make me look bad, cause she's really a knockout. She's 15, this kid -- a great piece of ass.
No, I see her around the pool. I know her. I know her like that -- not like that.
Don't be long. I'm afraid with all these tough guys here.
So, go ahead. Kill everybody. Kill Salvy, kill Vickie, kill Tommy Como, kill me while you're at it. What do I care? You're killing yourself the way you're eating, the way you worry about things you don't have to worry about.
What?
I meant, kill everybody. You or me or anybody. You're a big shot. Kill, kill... g'head.
So what?
You're worried about this girl, you're gonna let this girl ruin you're life for you... You wanna worry, worry about your fuckin' stomach that you can't bend over -- that you gotta step in the ring in a month.
What?
Whadda ya mean?
Whatsa matter with you?
I gotta go. I gotta get outta here. I can't take this shit. Lenore is waitin' for me. I gotta go. You're a definite wacko. You're fuckin' crazy, you know that, crazy.
I just wanted to say hello.
I don't know. 'Cause you're cute.
Jake, you made me promise not to get you excited.
I took the kids to my sister's.
I got bored so I went to the movies.
I went to the movies.
"Father of the Bride."
Oh, c'mon. For Christsake, do I have to tell you everything?
What're you talking about?
I am answering...
I'm leaving you Jake.
No. This time it's true. I didn't bother to tell you until I had everything worked out.
Get lost.  Hey kids, "A cop is a rat." Remember that, "A rat."
Get that idea out of your mind. It will only lead you in the wrong direction.
Not yet.
All the things I hate.
Did you get my note?
People with sense can belong wherever they're put.
No. The shades are still drawn in their apartment.
I have a feeling we've just begun.
When those cops get a look at Miss Fremont -- they'll even contribute.
Fine. Corkscrew's on the right.
There's nothing I'm hiding. It's just that --
Some people can. Now if you'll let me explain --
All right. That's your opinion. You're entitled to it, but --
I have one now.
Tell me about it.
He likes the way his wife welcomes him home.
Homework. It's more interesting.
Nothing, thank heaven.
I wouldn't dare answer that.
Not yet!
I'd be no better than Thorwald, to refuse.
Is he cleaning house?
Wanna make the colored lights go around and around?
How 'bout you?  Say the word and you're cold, Jack--you're dead.
Hold it, Jim.
You mind if I try?  You have to slam the door in my face?  I try to get to him--what happens?  Don't I give you everything you want?  A bicycle--you get a bicycle. A car--
Not just buy!  You hear all this talk about not lovely your kids enough.  We give you love and affection, don't we?
That's not what I mean.  I've never done anything right.  I've been going around with my head in a sling for years...I don't want to drag you into this but I can't help it.  I don't think I can prove anything by going around pretending I'm tough any more, so maybe you look like one thing but you still feel like another.
Are you listening to me?  You're involved in this!  I want to go to the police and tell them I was mixed up in this thing tonight?
Have some cigars.
Go on--Give 'em to your friends.
Open it.
Look--can't you see I'm writing?
Who knows.  Plato?
What's a chickie-run?
Not lately.
I promise nothing'll happen if you do.  You want my jacket?  It's warm.
Goodbye, dear.
Hang loose, boy.  I'm warning you.
Big tough character.  You don't kid me, pal.  How come you're not wearing your boots?
Just walk over here quietly now-- and there won't be any trouble.
I don't know, but we can't stay here.
I'm never going back.
You disappointed?
What?
So do you.
It's not going to be lonely, Judy. Not for you and not for me.
It is for me too.
He hates me.
He hates me.
I'm tired, Judy.  I'd like to change the subject.
I'd like to, that's all.  Girls your age don't do that.  You need an explanation?
...whoever she is.
I can get another one going. Y'know, hey, whatever you want me to --
Beauty and fragrances.
Nick, it won't work. It won't work!
Nick...
Nick, what are you talking about?
Part of... with them?
I... you told me your name was Rudy. You told me a million times, back in the truck, telling me you weren't Nick --
You were screaming you weren't Nick! And we just didn't fucking believe you!
You said it a million times!
Hey.
Might as well be.
I been driving rigs a long time, Nick. Four, five million miles of road. Worked for people who wouldn't keep me on less I was driving fifteen hours a day. Tell 'em I needed sleep, I needed rest, shit, they'll hire someone else...
What, we walking in there and delivering toys?
I don't know... what you're...
There anytime you don't got a mouthful of shit?
Acid-chewer.
He didn't recognize me. Back off, willya? He didn't recognize me.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah. Fuckin' Christmas.
Standing right here, man!
What? No...
I'm ninety-two years old --
There is no other table --
Scagnetti? Oh shit, I hear he's a motherfucker.
You're coming back to work for us, right?
Really? Who's your P.O.?
It's not the black Beverly Hills, it's the black Palos Verdes. Anyway, this chick, Elois, was a man-eater- upper. I bet every guy who's ever met her has jacked off to her at least once. You know who she looked like? Christie Love. 'Member that TV show "Get Christie Love"? She was a black female cop. She always used to say "You're under arrest, sugar."
Pam Grier.
What the fuck was that chick's name? Oh this is just great, I'm totally fuckin' tortured now.
I stand outside and guard the door. I don't let anybody come in or go out.
Mr. Brown stays in the car. He's parked across the street till I give him the signal, then he pulls up in front of the store.
Crowd control. They handle customers and employees in the display area.
Chew? Toby Chew? No.
Who gives a damn?
I don't have the slightest fuckin' idea what you're talkin' about.
That's your excuse for going on a kill crazy rampage?
I don't tip because society says I gotta. I tip when somebody deserves a tip. When somebody really puts forth an effort, they deserve a little something extra. But this tipping automatically, that shit's for the birds. As far as I'm concerned, they're just doin' their job.
Go down the hall, turn left, up those stairs, then turn right.
So you wanna git bit, huh?
You said yourself, you thought about takin' him out.
You takin' his side?
Maybe you won't feel that way after I tell you what I stopped in for.
Too much excitement. Or maybe it's just the heat. How about the surrey. Can you fix it?
Are the horses stragglin' or aren't they?
His letters will keep.
You're not going out to look for them?
That's right -- worry about your clothes --
To the other side of the street.
A man I used to know.
Swimming.
I'll eat when I'm good and ready.
What makes you think you're so almighty? Telling people what to do and how to act when you don't even know how yourself.
The whole state's lookin' for 'em.  And they're lookin' for me.
There, there. Don't you upset yourself --
Go ahead.
And we're running out of that.
Everybody knows --
I was at first. Then I was hanging on.  Are you going far?
Without someone to teach you, it's tough.
It's a long ways yet.  I figure we ought to camp. She's tired.
Uh, Alex, we've only know each other one day.
Okay... maybe that would be best.
It's Hanson, he's evil. Let's get him!
Sure, that would be cool. Friends.
That we should take our friendship a little further?
Oh, Buddy, I was thinking the same thing. It might be our last night in this house. And I think we should take full advantage of it.
Oh.
Then what are we going to do?
That sounds kinda gay, but since you're a guy, I guess it's okay.
Yeah, they're so warm and soft.
Not in a thousand years.
My child, you're alive!
We? What do you mean... we?
My child you are the only survivor.
Shorty! You're alive!! But... what about your head?
I wouldn't go that far.
Right. What about condoms?
Hey, you're the one who brought up safety. I'm perfectly willing to go in raw.
Fine.  What's all this stuff?
Yeah, I can see that. Later I want you to teach me that trick, but right now we have a job to do.
Second best.
Because she will lie?
"Fucked me."
"Fucked me."
No more violence... No more violence...
I certainly did not.
But Mom, the video's not over.
I know this sounds weird, Mr. Sutphin, but the Department of Motor Vehicle's computer shows only one blue station wagon registered to a parent of any of Mr. Stubbins' pupils.
That's nice.
Amen to that.  It's been a crazy day, hasn't it?!
Is this the Cocksucker residence?
Isn't this 4215 Pussy Way?
Let me check the zip - 212 Fuck you?
Well, Dottie, how come they're not here then, Fuck-Face?
Socially... I'll have a beer.
Don't say words unless you mean them, Misty. 
...Browsing.
I didn't want that Faberge egg - it was chipped!
NO! I could never hurt anyone!
I didn't hear anything. Got any dessert?
What's he know?
You could go and open the door.
She could use a hundred dollars.
She can only use cash.
I did her hair.
Nothing.
She was just asking about you - Whether it was nice to work for you or not.
No. She asked about the trademark.
She showed me a drawing.
Oh, I had business with a man... but I missed him -
I know  I shouldn't have told you
I'm Mimi -- I'm dying.
Yes. It's been quiet, oh ever so quiet. I hardly move, yet it keeps coming all the time -closer and closer. I rest and rest and yet I am dying.
I'm afraid.
I can imagine.
I'm a good boy, but no one listens to what I say.
I don't think that you would understand if I told you.
I've lost my knack.
I'd like that.
A strange collection. You're like the false god you worship... fallen angels, all of you.
Unless what?
It would be a charming experience. She might only protest half as much.
Why?
What did he say?
Yes, Jacqueline. You were always talking suicide - - of ending your life when you wanted to.
Oh, lots of reasons, most of them boring. But, up until I dropped out, John and I were... very much alike.
I would imagine that we are, now. I think I'm ready to use the bathroom, finally.
I think so. I remember reading somewhere that men learn to love what they're attracted to, whereas women become more and more attracted to the person they love.
All of these are interviews?
Can we look at one?
Why not?
It's a simple question. Have you ever thought of having -- making love with someone other than your husband?
I'm not planning on it.
You did that?
I drove around. Then I went to talk with Graham.
No. I don't know. I haven't told him about the garbage thing because I'm pissed off at him right now. He's letting some old college buddy stay at our house for a couple of days, and he didn't even ask me about it. I mean, I would've said yes, I just wish he would've asked.
I guess I'm upset because I can't really justify being upset, I mean, it's his house, really, he pays the mortgage.
Yeah, I know.
Fine, I guess. Except right now I'm going through this where I don't want him to touch me.
Not really. Maybe if I just saw him on the street I'd have said that, but after talking to him... he's just kind of... I don't know, unusual.
Why?
Why, so you can go after him?
Thirty-two dollars.
What do you get?
Not exactly.
Why don't you let me tape you?
Talking.
Sex. Your sexual history, your sexual preferences.
Nothing.
I just want to ask you questions.
That's all.
Yes.
Absolutely not. They are for my private use only.
I turn on the camera. You start talking.
Yes.
That depends on you. One woman only used three minutes. Another filled up three two hour tapes.
No.
Whichever you prefer.
Just a moment.
Why?
I can handle it. Besides, the money is good and some of the guys are cute. And you are in no position to be jealous.
I did.
You told Ann about this?
I wish you hadn't done that.
It's just something I'd prefer she didn't know about.
I just... Ann is very...
It just wasn't a smart thing to do. Did you sign any sort of paper, or did he have any contract with you saying he wouldn't broadcast these tapes?
You realize you have no recourse legally? This stuff could show up anywhere.
You trust him.
What do you mean?
It hurts that you would say that to me.
By definition you're lying to Ann, too.
Look, are we going to do it or not?
Well, I'm here now. I'd like to do something...
My keys?
I can't, dummy. He'll see that the pack's been opened. You're such a dumbhead.
Buy 'em with what, dumbhead?
Meeting Rollo at Tudor's. Might take a while.
Please pardon me. I am Niccolo Spergazzi. I am a resident here. I don't know... we were walking in the hallway and... Cabiria... my wife... she was attacked by this thing... here, on her arm.
I don't get it.
BREAKING OUT
BREAKING OUT
BREAKING OUT
He needs help.
I am in Farley's employ -- and...  ...we're discussing a network deal.
Everyone loves the girl next door, particularly Farley.
Bert brought them over from Europe.  They had a very popular series together.  It's still rerun in a lot of countries.  You must have seen them in 'Dentonvale?'
SOME PEOPLE DO IT ON THE PAVEMENT
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR THEIR LOVERS
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR MOVEMENT
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR EMPLOYMENT
Who?
Good!  Well there's still hope. Lots of hope.
Farley!
Flavors!
Fabulous!
Fast!
Foods!
WHAT A JOKE...
YOU PLAY FOR BROKE...
OH ROMANCE IS NOT A CHILDREN'S GAME...
It's all in the wrist.  You know, you look really familiar. You from around here? Where'd you go to high school?
I don't know. You just seem really familiar to me. Never mind. Enjoy your meals.
Doctor Derek Sommersby? You mean from "One Life to Live"?
Hey, Evelyn, it's your favorite client.
Good, good. Drinking some good wines and kicking back, you know. So what's happening? Still no word?
And?
Huh.
You should get back together with Victoria. She was good for you.
You said you loved me! You fuck! I hope you die!
100% Pinot Noir. Single vineyard. They don't even make it anymore.
Jesus. Don't ask questions like that up in the wine country. They'll think you're a moron.
Color in the red wines comes from the skins. This juice is free run, so there's no skin contact in the fermentation, ergo no color.
Thanks, Jack. So do I.  Here we are.
Want some?
Oooh. Oh. Miles. Miles.
Nah. I want to watch this.
Yeah, well, maybe you should check your messages first.
Sure, whatever. Maybe I'll catch a movie.
Hey, asshole! That's not cool!
Yeah, they're great. Sporty. They're really sporty.
You're joking, right?  What are you doing? Un-fucking- believeable. Can we just go back to the hotel and hang out and get up early and play nine holes before we head home?
Nothing. Buckle up, okay?
The Windmill.
I think they overdid it a bit. Too much alcohol. Overwhelms the fruit.
Great. What's the latest we can get there?
Okay.
A little place in Los Olivos. New owners. Cozy ambiance. Excellent food too -- you should try it. Thought of you at the Hitching Post last night.
Well, I've come to never expect greatness from a Cab Franc, and this one's no exception. Sort of a flabby, overripe --
Oh, that's right. Isn't that nice? I hope that girls knows how lucky she is, marrying no less than Derek Summersby.
This one?
This one?
Hi baby.
I heard.
Yes.
What are you doing?
I know.  We need to be sure, before we open that door Graham.
Oh.
Don't yell at her!
Do you owe anybody money? You can tell me off the record if you need too.
It's like War of the Worlds.
What friend is that?
Yeah... maybe. So long.
Have you thought at all about your plans?
This is where Baxter and Hawley brung us.
And they were two of them. Look --
It's a town...
I expect.
I expect.
Last one to the Midnight Star buys.
His son is worse than he was. He's smoother, so you don't always hear him coming, but he'll do anything to keep his range free.
I'm done talking. Get out.
Really?
Shut up. You need help, don't you?
Well I'm real happy for you, Cobb. But I think I'll keep looking for mine.
Yeah. Bad luck.  Good-bye, Cobb.
He left me.
Who?
How can I?  Your last three pictures tanked.  The board is giving me hell.  No bankable star will work with you after this.  If you just compromised... a little.
That's genius, Viktor.  Was that Simone's idea?
Do what?
I do?
Excuse me?  Start?
That sounds wonderful.  How do you feel about all this, Lainey?
No, thank God for you, Mr. Taransky.  How many men would go to so much trouble to protect a woman?
It's a re-make, Hal.  Anders is not bigger than this picture.
I've seen them all before.
Come on, Hank.  A synthespian, virtual actor -- ?
I need flesh and --
-- a living, breathing actor -- I can't work with a fake.
Why?
I know plenty of boys.
Dad, I can spot a middle-aged freak a mile away.
I do.
I read.
You were the one who insisted on it.  Reading me Dostoyevsky and Joyce when I was four.
Why not?  I can get you something else.  What do you want?
No, that was me.
Lainey...
I want to see her.  Unless you show me Simone live and in person I show these pictures to the authorities.
Long live the First Amendment.
Good.
She's already here.  She arrived before you and she'll leave long after you've gone.  Remember, under no circumstances are you or any other person to enter the set without my express permission.
Let it burn.  Simone would rather go up in flames than give up her privacy.
Are you ever going to tell the truth about me, Mr. Taransky?
You know what I'm talking about.
Goodnight, sweetheart.
If it's okay with you?
Yeah. Sorry.
Me too.
Don't give up. You're the only one who can help me. I know it.
Where will you go, where no one has died?
Tell you my secrets.
Cole, please stop.
S-ssstop that!
S-ssssstop it!
--Shhhhhhut upppp you fffffffreak!
Nope.
You were a beat and a quarter behind.
I ain't never played a banjo in my life.
Not lately.
Bus broke down.
I am not! I'm telling you, it's worth its weight in gold.
Come out, come out wherever you are!
I don't think so.
Who? Us?!
Yeah. That sounds good. "Hang a left at the first cow patty, then make a right when you see porky pig".
I said that's enough!
No. Not without you --
Who knows? Just like a man... never around when you need them.
That's not funny.
Whatcha' doin'?
Bill, I'll run out to your car, call for paramedics from there.
That's the mystery of the ages there, Trev. Starla was seventeen when they got engaged. He was, like, in his thirties. No one even knew they were goin' out till she had that ring on her finger.
What do you see? I see a butterfly.
Shut up.
I'm just some big clown to you, ain't I?
Out.
Through a wound on his stomach?
If...?
Okay.
We lost him.
You want to lose this putz or not?!?
Well, that's what you get for falling in love with a guy who's first name is Ramblin'.
You gotta admire the man's determination.
Is that any way to talk to your ole partner?  Look, it's only nine hundred miles each way.
No one's ever done it before. This'll put us on the map.
Did I tell you they're gonna give us a brand new Kenworth?
Redneck heaven.
What does the old Timex say?
I'll drop off my fare, hit a quick choke-and-puke and be blocking for you pronto.
You okay?
God's back on our side, so let's get smokin'.
Pick it up, Breaker.
What's up, Dixie Chicken?
I'll keep my eyeballs peeled.
-- Yeah, Banana Peel, go head on.
-- Yeah, I heard. But they won't hold him for long. Anyway, he sure gave them sumbitches a run for their money.
Welcome to the new Bureau. Nobody shares information anymore, it's become synonymous with job security.
The other agent. He said he was here to do an inspection and later, when he got on the elevator with the other guy, Carruthers, I saw him wearing one of our security jackets...
That's not possible. I told you.
Won't work, we're just gonna have to chance it man. I'm sorry.
-- Fine, fuck, I got it... Lake Tahoe, Nevada. I'll have Hugo book your flight, you can be here in a couple hours. He'll meet you at the airport.
Okay.
That's Mecklen. The deal's closing. I can pick that phone up and I can work this out.  You'll walk with me.
You think it's possible he could be involved in the Israel hit?
...Almost.  What do you mean "who Sparazza actually was..."
-- who can say. He's off his onion, y'know, he's old school Sicilian, this is how they hate.
Hey, we nab Israel, they pay t'get'm back, I'll cut the fuckin' thing out m'self, no extra charge. My thing is, we crew up, let's not fuck around, someone's cousin, some Zip off the boat from Naples, let's get pros, people who know how to behave.
Chances are, they're gonna get into some shit too, hafta put people down.
Yeah, I can front this.
That's the punchline, y'ready?
A million flat.
None whatsoever.
I'mma grip and rip girl.  I got some handloads here ready to cut heads.
...Girl, y'know I had to bring big mamma through.
Jus' keep doin' y'damage girl, keep these mafuckas off my as--
She reappeared exactly as she had before?
Why, who did you see?
Who was it?
No.
I've never heard you express any desire to leave before now.  Why now?
But why is it doing what it's doing? Given it's resources, it could have done anything.  Presented me with your double, and you with mine.
Human beings can die.
I'll go with you.
Not exactly.  It exists in a continuum that wasn't proven until ten years ago, a higher mathematical dimension superimposed on top of the Universe. An infinite number of them, in fact. It was a violation of all of our various laws regarding the Universe, Space, or Space-Time.  It was completely counter-intuitive.  We had to unlearn everything.
Intelligent beyond our comprehension.
It's something.
The whole idea of God was dreamed up by a silly animal with a small brain called Man.  Even the limits we put on it are human limits.  It can do this, it can do that!  It designs, it creates!
You're talking about a man in a white beard again.  You're ascribing human characteristics to something that isn't human.  Human beings look for causes and patterns.  How could we know what Solaris is up to, if anything?
I think so.
Yes.  Especially toward the end.
You... she said I didn't love her.
No.  I love you.
Rheya --
Why do you say that?
You still writing the occasional magazine article?
Then c'mon.  Follow me.  The art's in the basement, you're going to get a privileged peek.
I got money.
Absolutely.  Look at this.
Let go!
I trusted you!  I thought you cared about me?!
More bullshit!  More bullshit!  What kind of odds are they giving me?  There must be some kind of office pool.  One month?  A couple of days?
Do you dance?
Pretty bad.
I don't know...
I think it's probably still a good idea.
I don't know Tommy.
I think television's a dangerous thing.
Take it easy!  I set her up.  I saw it coming.
It is my fault!  I'm responsible for her!
Did you hear what I said?!!
I'm all right.
Koontz!  I need you guys!
No, I need'm now!
She's not a suspect, sir, she's a witness.  Could I ask you to step outside, please.
Sir, I am just trying to do my job, it's standard procedure to question the witness alone.  Help me out here, could you please leave.
Just "lay back, Mack"... lay back...
Let me see.
Hm.  What a lump.
Well, I've missed a lot of classes myself...
Frmpph-yrr.
Huh?
I-- uh--
I lov-loathe Elizabeth Allan. Abhor, detest, despise--
I'm sure you kept warm.
Hello.  So very boring.  Peter Parker, how do you feel about me this morning?
Hm.  Well, I like you, too.  I like your aunt.  I like your shoelaces. I like--
That's the understatement of the year.
It's fine.  Tell me what--
Aunt May, what happened?
How is he?
I heard about Thorkel's order--
No, thank you.  I'm sure you've got your own problems.
Yeah, just a lung full of New Jersey.  Lucky you showed up when you did.
Imagine how I feel.
The usual.  Heredity and environment.  What's the deal with Doc Ock?
And blow up the universe just to prove he's right?  Bit egotistical, isn't it?
Forgive me if I don't feel too sympathetic right now.
I don't have to think. We didn't tell anything to anybody. Not a word. Not until we hit this barrack.
I don't know anymore.
Maybe it's going to be a longer war than you figured -- eh, Duke?
I'll call the whole pot.
You are talking crazy!
Oh, come now! You threw a time bomb.
Droppen Sie dead!  Raus mit dem Ofen. Los! Los!
They'll shoot you, Animal!
I clocked him this morning. He was running like a doll.
Animal! Got a little something for you!
Curtains would do wonders for this barrack.  You will not get them.
You have elected me Security. The way things have been going in this Barracks, I guess I've done a poor job and I want to make up for it. Is that asking too much?
Says who?
You take it out. Only you're going to have a riot on your hands.
He's a Nazi, Price is. For all I know, his name is Preismaier or Preissinger. Sure, he lived in Cleveland, but when the war broke out he came back to the Fatherland like a good little Bundist. He spoke our lingo so they put him through spy school, gave him phony dogtags --
They know about that gadget. I'd worry more about the radio.
You are trying to say that an American would inform on other Americans?
Not particularly.
What was I going to do with them? I only smoke cigars.
I don't know. He bathed, now he is roaming the ship. He must be the only Engineer in Starfleet who does not go to Engineering!
But I did not deal with it, sir. I let it prevent me from helping my friend.  Does that make me a coward?
Guilt. It is a most unpleasant feeling.
No, but I'd stay out of Sickbay for a while if I were you. I still don't know why you dropped her in the water.
The station complement was nineteen.
Soran doesn't care about power or weapons. All he cares about is getting back to the Nexus.
Please, please.
She's not real either, is she? Nothing here is. Nothing here matters.
Where are the deflector relays?
Make it so.
Very well. I suppose I could make out my weekly report to Starfleet Command without your input.  "Admiral Lusby, regarding the unusual behavior of Jean-Luc Picard: I find him increasingly irritable, remote and uncooperative. I recommend forced shore leave at a Starbase facility in order to-"
Not if it means killing over two hundred million people.  I wonder, did your wife Leandra know that she married a man who was capable of mass murder?
Lock phasers and return fire!
I can't get an answer. Starfleet is up to its brass in galactic conference. No one has time for those who only stand... and wait.
Scotty...?
Like your father... so human.  All units functional, recorders are on... Scanning sector one. Foliage in fully developed state of growth. Temperature, twenty- two point two Celsius.
Sector three... Sub-tropical vegetation... Temperature --  Temperature decreasing rapidly --
... Fascinating.
You must be very proud of what you and your mother have created.
Grissom, your message acknowledged. Will advise... Out.
Yes, Saavik, go ahead...
Aye, sir!
Much is at stake...
What about Grissom, Mr. Chekov?
No, sir, no response.
Of course... Now take my suggestion, enjoy your leave -- and let all this tension blow away.
Any time.
I will speak with you alone, Kirk.
Good.  This is the turn of luck I have been waiting for.
I underestimated him... He did the one thing I didn't anticipate ... He destroyed himself...
Killing his son was <U>stupid</U>! It made Kirk willing to die.
They are useless! It was Kirk I needed. And I let him slip away.
Our mission is over. I have failed... A human has been bolder and more ruthless than I...  That -- is the real dishonor.
Four hundred years old. You don't find many with the lens still intact.
For your eyes. For most patients of your age, I generally administer Retlax Five to restore flexibility of the lens.
Exactly. Happy birthday.
This one looks like a Steward. They're not warm, but rigor hasn't set in. This didn't happen all that long ago, Jim.
We have received new orders. Upon our arrival at Regula I, all materials of Project Genesis will be transferred to this ship for immediate testing at Ceti Alpha VI.
I don't think there's another piece of information we could squeeze into the memory banks. Next time, we'll design a bigger one.
I saw it -- !
<u>We were still there</u>, you dumb bastard! We could hear the screams all the way to the transporter room --
I don't know.
<u>Full power damn you</u>!
KHAN!
Spock?
All right, we'll do the job with auxiliary power.
The word is given: warp speed.
How far?
Give up Genesis, she said. What in God's name does that mean? Give it up to whom?
It's all we've got.
He won't break off now. If he followed me this far he'll be back. But from where...?
Lieutenant, self-expression does not seem to be one of your problems.
You earned it.
You're bothered by your performance on the <u>Kobayashi Maru</u>.
There is no correct resolution. It is a test of character.
You may ask, Lieutenant.
If Stage Two was completed, it was underground -- she said it was going to be underground.
Power levels quite low, sir.
Visual.
Inform the Klingons we are on a rescue mission...
Never, sir.
I tried to clear things up, Professor Scott. I explained you'd come all the way from Edinburgh on appointment to study manufacturing methods here at Plexico, but they don't seem to know anything about it.
-- That's the general idea.
If you have a better idea - now's the time.
Really? You think this is its way of saying "Hi there" to the people of the Earth?
I liked him better before he died.
How do you explain slowing pulse, low respiratory rate and coma?
Fundoscopic examination is unrevealing in these cases!
My God, man, drilling holes in his head is not the answer. The artery must be repaired without delay or he will die! So put away your butcher knives and let me save the patient!
That's odd. Uhura, what's on the Comm channels...?
I suppose they told you that...?
Uh huh. What about you? Where you from?
A landlubber. Come on, what the hell were you boys really trying to do back there? Was it some kinda macho thing? If that's all, I'm gonna be real disappointed. I hate that macho type.
Go ahead.
What's what?
You need me.
What is our target in time?
Surely you can be more specific...
What are the variables...?
You've programmed that from memory...?
Yes?
Why not?
I see.
I cannot tell a lie.
Exaggerate.
The hell I can't
They are very unhappy about the way their species has been treated by man.
I believe I was successful in communicating our intentions.
No data, Admiral. Computers are non-functional.
Wing to cruise configuration... Full impulse power.
Right.  Now look: I want you all to be very careful. This is terra incognita. Many customs will doubtless take us by surprise. It's a forgone conclusion these people have never seen an extra-terrestrial before.
Appreciated by all, Mr. Scott.  Prepare for departure.
Well done, Mr. Scott. How soon can we be ready for warp speed?
Don't take too long. We're sitting ducks for their radar systems...  Mr. Sulu, impulse climb.
Millions?
Sulu Hikaru.
Arigato. Sayonara.  Thank you, honorable sir.
This is a school... that's a student's work.  She'll be ready to become an apprentice soon. Then, in thirty or forty years, she'll take her place among the artisans...
More questions. Always the explorer. If you stay long enough, that'll change.
You'll stop reviewing what happened yesterday... stop planning for tomorrow... until you find...  Let me ask you a question -- have you ever experienced a perfect moment in time?
When time seemed to stop... and you could almost live in that moment...
Yes. Exactly. Nothing more complicated than perception.  You explore the universe. We've discovered a single moment in time can be a universe in itself... full of powerful forces... most people aren't aware enough of the now... to ever notice them...
It took us centuries to learn that it doesn't have to take centuries to learn.
I'll be here.
Bye.
What's the last thing you remember, Data...
From the mission...
Our procedures were in place to protect the planet's population from unnecessary risk...
... And now he's holding our people hostage down there...
That's probably not a good idea. Your ship hasn't been fitted for this region; there are environmental concerns...
We haven't fully identified the anomalies yet. They're calling this whole area The Briar Patch... it took us a day to reach a location where we could get a signal out to you. Just get me Data's schematics. I'll keep you informed.  Dougherty out.
Scan for lifesigns.
When I was an ensign, I could detect a three-micron mis- alignment...
Why not?
Deck ten.
You've not aged a day since then?
Make it so.
Accelerated hair growth is often experienced by Klingons during Jak'tahla...
What are they interested in...?
You should feel right at home with them.
And have you noticed how your boobs have started to firm up?
It may not be that simple. This is an extremely difficult and paranoid time in human history.
I'm saying they might shoot us on sight. You have to remember... these people have watched their entire way of life collapse around them.
Let's hope so. Because if Cochrane dies... the future may die with him.
Intelligence... ambition... desire... I bring order to chaos...
Yes... but the Enterprise... my duty...
Today is March second, 2063. The time in Montana is oh-eight-forty- five.
Oh... just a little tinkering. How is he?
They used copper pipes in their plumbing... so I melted it down... and fused it with some tritanium from one of our phaser casings.  It's not the strongest alloy... but it's better than all this crude aluminum and steel.
Speed -- two hundred, seventy-five thousand kilometers per second.
It wasn't a trick. I used to be an electrical engineer.
I can try.
On screen.
Aye, sir.
Incoming message from the Starship Intrepid. Admiral Hayes.
I guess I'd better get it right the first time.
Hold that thought.
Admiral Donald...Bill...
At present I'm awaiting a full report from Enterprise. Pending that I am constrained to observe Interstellar Law.
You heard the order, Lieutenant.
Don't remind me.
Captain, shall we attempt to return fire?
That's a comfort...
That isn't true...!
First rule of assassination: always kill the assassins.
They must have walked through it when it was floating and tracked it back here.
Now we go to Starfleet?
ALL uniforms?
Starfleet's been charting and cataloging planetary atmospheres. All vessels are equipped with chemical analytic sensors...
Don't you know? Everyone on Rura Penthe is here for life.
Plot a course for Kronos, Lieutenant.
I'm still in the chair, Lieutenant.
When does this conference start?
Thank you, Captain Sulu.
According to the data bank, we HAVE - twice...
Make ourselves a target?
Not from a distance. She won't show up on ANY type of scan.
I don't want to.
What is it?
Thank you, Mr. Scott. We were to return to spacedock, the killers would surely manage to dispose of their incriminating footwear.
Well, what about all that atmospheric equipment we're carrying to catalogue gaseous anomalies?
It'll serve you right.
I can't be sure but the rate of decay seems to be accelerating.
I can see that.
Affirmative, sir. Negative, sir. They have instigated security overrides and erected a force field around the external portals.
This is not an appropriate time for a conversation.
Because the captain has to concentrate on piloting the vehicle.
The resemblance is... striking.
Permission denied. If you can possibly endure any more of these assaults.  I need you at my side. Now more than ever I...
Your timing is impeccable, Commander.
When this is over, I owe you a drink.
He wants to look me in the eye.
Praetor Shinzon, I'm pleased to...
Aye, sir
It's an old psychological strategy, Number One. To put him in a position of dominance and make us uneasy.
Counselor?
I promise you in time, she'll become your home ...If I could offer you one piece of advice?
When your first officer insists that you can't go on away missions... Ignore him.
You know I do.
I know.
I'm honored to think I might someday speak with such eloquence.
Please.
You can still make a choice! Make the right one now!
We're being hailed.
She is here.
There is. They came out of the belly of the ship and then went to the first terrace and flew down into the houses.
It is beautiful.
When can we expect containment?
It's in a green Mustang?
Watch it. They're coming out.
What.
We're going to have to stop for gas soon.
From?
Space?
A drink.
You want to try it?
This stuff could kill...  Be my guest.
Is that a baby?
A baby is a new person?
Do you have a baby?
Why?
Why?
What?
On the radio they say it's good.
You're damn right I am.
This is very interesting. We are born knowing our history. We have other books. But not a book like this.
I understand.
Many of my people will not believe those things are possible. On my planet there is only one government, one people, one language. I will be asked a lot of questions.
I will say that we can be friends.
I'm never going to see you again, am I?
Pull over. I've got to get back there.
It's easier not to tell if you don't know.
We're ready.
It was kind of like clicking, maybe a language wasn't it?
It was a man though... right?
I saw you play, man.  You were good. Like a fucking freight train I remember saying.  So what happened, injuries or what?
It's always politics.  Like this thing we're in here, he's paying you to tune me up, right?  But I could pay you more not to.  See what I mean?  I could write you a check right now--
Okay cash!  Logical.  Here's everything I have on me, what do you say?  How about a Rolex?
Just not the eyes.
Take her up to the suite.  Have a glass of champagne... or six... I'll be up in a while to help you ring in the New Year.
I just got to talk to you for one second.
Yeah... he figured out what to do all right.
The killer knew right where she was. Because he put her there.
Uh unh, carrying a gun wrecks the line of a fine jacket.
Yeah.  So don't walk near me in public, alright.
And who was, regrettably, also your best fucking friend.
You must be so pleased, I followed your jellybean trail right here, like a good little chump.
Yeah, important for your label. Which no doubt is why you're in mourning.  Don't worry, his records'll sell out now he's dead. You'll make out.
Faith, can I talk to you a second?
Fumitsu.
I have crawled through the gutter... through every wrinkle in the human brain.
It is my sword and my shield, Macey.
I need to see more... get more detail.  Something.  I feel his presence, so strong...
This tie doesn't go with blue!
You sure?
It didn't stop you from loving them. Right?  Or understanding them, or being able to forgive them...
And it didn't stop you from wanting to protect them.  Did it?
Yeah.  We did.
Fine.  Do you want blood running waist deep in the storm drains?  The gangbangers'll spread like a wave through this city and burn it to the ground.  And when the fires start the street cops'll be capping off at anything that moves.  It'll be all- out war and you know it.
You really want that on your head?
That's right, Jan.
I'm not in the mood for Native American wisdom.
I appreciate it, doctor. You know how it is, press screaming for answers, Washington's all over me.  Ever handle a serial case?
Why me? What do you want from me!?
What are you doing?
I don't believe this.
Mack the Mouth at a loss for words.
Listen to this guy? Can you believe this? He'll never change. Born a liar, first word out of his mouth was a lie. Make up a story, always a story, any goddamn story, to save his ass.
Me too.  Make any headway with "Zorro"?
I was thinking, maybe we should ask Professor Daitz. Nobody knows this stuff better.
He's a consultant to a network TV program on Profilers. He gets a check every episode.
I can't. They trust me, they accept me. I've got their confidence.
Oh.
Burn marks. The original M.E. listed it as "burn residue." Same place, the outer thigh, as Karen Sumpter. The UNSUB is able to abduct, kill, transport and bury without detection.
Low calls him Suspect Zero.
That's what Koessler wants us to believe. To discredit Low.
But it was your idea: "use Zero," you said, use Zero to get Low.
The little piggie speaks.
Yeah.
So you're the new meat?
What did you do to end up here?
Johnny, get this man's file. Mackelway, right?
Hot enough for you, Agent Mackelway? Hell's doorknob. What they got you doing?
Sounds like fun.
Murman!
Brilliant? You think he caught any of them because he was brilliant? Hardboy? MyDick? Imelda? Ripper? Think about it, how did he locate them?  He found them as Murman. And how did Murder Man find them? With sweet talk and brains? No. He did it with souvenirs. He took them into private rooms, swapped goodies: pictures, panties, jewelry, body parts. Snuff downloads. As bait. That's why I never exchanged with him. He killed girls, oh yeah, harvested them. He had the best stuff. Richard Low is Murman and Murman is one of us.
Hi.
Hi, Mike. I'm Lorraine.
Yes. Like the quiche.
I thought real men don't like quiche.
Why? You're not a real man?
Hey, man. At least it's Disney.
...And she's with someone else.
Sure, I guess. The phone's in the back.
...Six months.
Fine... I guess. You?
Yeah?
What kind of things?
I thought you met someone else.
Really?
Why didn't you call?
...the Michelin commercial...
Pierre... That's his name? Pierre? Is he French?
Bud.
What's the point?
Give me the money. I'll get it.
...People get carjacked...
Hi, Nikki. Mike. I don't think this is working out. I think you're great, but maybe we should just take some time off from each other. It's not you, really. It's me. It's only been six months...
Nikki! Great! Did you just walk in, or were you listening all along?
Wow, I guess you were home... 
Whu?
That's what I'm telling you, baby. The babies love that stuff. They don't want all that sensitive shit. You start talking to them about puppy dogs and ice cream. They know what you want. What do you think? You think they don't?
They know what you want, believe me. Pretending is just a waste of time. You're gonna take them there eventually anyway. Don't apologize for it.
Respect, my ass. They respect honesty. You see how they dress when they go out? They want to be noticed. You're just showing them it's working. You gotta get off this respect kick, baby. There ain't nothing wrong with letting them now that you're money and that you want to party.
This version doesn't have fighting?
What? That was the best part of the old game.
I don't know. It was kind of a dick move if you ask me.
You asked her for her number, and then you tore it up.
That doesn't matter.
Chelios to Roenick...!
You think?
...double diamond...
True.
Have you gotten laid once since you moved here? Did you fuck once?
I know for a fact you haven't, because you never shut up about it. You're like a little whiney bitch...
Good.  He never doubted you.
Yes. 
I swear I'm innocent.  I swear on the head of my children, I'm innocent.  Mike, don't do this to me, please Mike, don't do this to me!
OK, but be careful.
Maybe, or you gotta know now.
And with prison record.
When did he call?
On a day like this.  Consiglero, do you also have in your notes the the Turk made his living from Prostitution before the war, like the Tattaglias do now.  Write that down before you forget it.  The Turk will wait.
How did you find out?
Calo is having a cup of coffee in the kitchen.  Is your wife coming with you?
Okay.  One minute.
You start operating, the five families will start their raids again.  We're at a stalemate Sonny, your war is costing us a lot of money.
Yes.  That's true, you're getting a hell of a reputation.
Let's say now that we have to kill McCluskey.  We'll clear that up through our Newspaper contacts later.
My brother Sonny found him living in the streets when he was a kid, so my father took him in.  He's a good lawyer.
Can I go to the hospital with you?
My parents don't read the Daily News.  All right, if you think I shouldn't.  I can't believe the things the papers are printing. I'm sure most of it's not true.
When will I see you again?
What?
I want to settle things tonight.  I want my father left alone.
Thanks.
Is my credit good enough to buy you out?
Everybody should have one talent.  What's yours?
It's always the same whenever someone new comes into his life -- Freddie, Fausto, Peter Smith-Kingsley -- he's wonderful -- did you meet him, he's a musician? -- ...and especially you, of course... and that's only the boys.
I don't know. What's the name of your sailboat?
No, no brothers, no sisters.
What?
Which is horseshit. Have you heard him play that thing?  He can't.
No thanks.  Some kid at the American Express Office.  Are you living here?
We could go down to the bar -- no need for you to --
Hello Tom. You're off? What are your plans?
I'll go and see what's the matter.
Dickie hasn't killed himself. I'm sure of that. There's a private detective on the case now -- a Mr MacCarron -- Dickie's father's employing him.
He's American. He's already discovered Dickie cashed checks for $1000 the day before he disappeared.
What are you going to do now, Tom?
Why do I think there's never been a Ripley rainy day?
I know it was you -- I know it was you, Tom. I know it was you. I know you killed Dickie. I know it was you.
No, nothing. I'm just thinking about when Tom arrived in Mongi.  And now look at you.
Oh Meredith, I'm sorry. Of course I'll meet you. Let's have coffee in the morning at Dinelli's.
Exactly. 10.30 -- 
Where are you hiding him? He's impossible, isn't he?
He says so many fiances.
Good. But I think we should stay in here for the rest of the trip.
Was who Meredith?
Hardly kissing. Kissing off.
I lied. To her. She thought she'd seen you.
Dickie and Peter, that's just too good gossip, isn't it?
Well that would be even better gossip.
I know. I'm lost, too. I'm going to be stuck in the basement, aren't I, that's my, that's my -- terrible and alone and dark -- and I've lied about who I am, and where I am, and so nobody can ever find me.
I suppose I always thought -- better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody.
Peter, I... I...
You have the key. Tell me some good things about Tom Ripley. Don't get up. Just tell me some nice things.
That's an expensive gun.
I know what you mean. I've got the same problems. I just can't get things organized. Little things, I mean. Like my room, my possessions. I should get one of those signs that says, "One of these days I'm gonna get organezizied"
I mean porno movies.
My God!
That's the last. The finish. Period. Some people can learn. Some people can't. And you wonder why we never get serious --
Have you been noticing anything strange?
Why's that taxi driver across the street been staring at us?
That taxi driver. The one that's been sitting here.
I don't know -- but it feels like a long time.
A real skunk.
Yeah. Hey thanks. That's real nice, Travis.
O.K. It's a date. I'll see you here, then.
Yes I am.
Why, thank you Travis.
I'll tell you, Travis, I've learned more about this country sitting in taxi cabs than in the board room of General Motors.
What kind of guns do you guys use? .38's?
Yeah?
Yeah?
Shoot. They don't call me the Wizard for nothing.
Things got ya down?
It happens.
The taxi life, you mean.
I know.
Travis, look, I dig it. Let me explain. You choose a certain way of life. You live it. It becomes what you are. I've been a hack 27 years, the last ten at night. Still don't own my own cab. I guess that's the way I want it.  You see, that must be what I am.
MY girlfriend's pregnant.
No. I'm going to give you dancing lessons.  What the fuck do you think?
Yes.  To wish someone a prosperous jouey.
Delly... thanks, thank you.  I'll take good care of this.
Okay.  What's the second thing?
No, I... I just wondering where you've been all this time.
You look... different.
Yeah, a little.  I think you grew an inch or so.  And you've lost weight.
Nothing.  
I'm  fine.  Really.  
Well... everything.  It started coming back a couple of days ago. I remember everything now.
Delly.  I'm... I'm not... Harry wasn't my father.  And I'm not... I'm not Luke.
Um... no.  I don't have a statement at this time.
By all means.
When did I leave?
"one fryer and two-dozen eggs?"
Yeah, I know, but poultry...?
The film broke...
Thanks.
Don't smell nothin'.  He must not be dead in here.
Hey, it's the best way to tell.
What do you mean?
Leo, I didn't give them the names. I wouldn't do that.
Oh.
Actually, my grandpap.  But "ancestors" sounds better, don't it?  Here.
No, not really.
All right. 
If your father were here...
Did you put the cover on that cage, Mom?
Well, I ain't positive, if that's what you mean.
That case, I tell you what you do. You go straight through town 'til you see a little hotel on your left there. Not the motel, that's the other end of town. This is the hotel. Now you take a right turn there, you got that?
Near the top of the hill, you'll see the school and right behind it, the church. You head for the school. Now just past the school, you'll see a little house with a red mail box. That's where Annie Hayworth lives, she's the school teacher. You ask her about the little Brenner girl.
Yep.  Could save yourself a lot of trouble. Her name's Alice for sure.
We'll make our own fog.
Caviat emptor, Mother. Let the buyer beware.
I'm simply quoting the law.
You're doing fine.
Shhhh. Shhhh.
Monday?
Well, I...
I'm sorry.  What are you doing up here?
You came all the way up here to bring me those birds?
What for?
I'm sorry.  Who's your friend?
Yes?
Well, well, small world. Annie Hayworth.
How do you know Annie?
Did you! Imagine that! How long will you be staying?
I think we'll have to shave the hair. Deke, have you got a razor?
It's still bleeding a little. Here, let me put this on.
It is for me.
What do you want ?
Growing a beard...
So they united.
Well, they'll go along with anything.
Hear!
Hear, hear!
Take wing!
Inland.
Maybe.
Oh, good! Oh, wonderful.
I thought not. Birds have been on this planet since archaeopteryx, Miss Daniels; a hundred and twenty million years ago!
Yeah, birds. All they do is make a mess of everything. Who needs them?
Not if they're starting a war.
I'm very pleased to know you, Master Fettes.
That's right.  Gray, the cabman. I've had a bit of dealing with MacFarlane in the past, you know.
It's not the failure. I feel that MacFarlane has taught me nothing. He taught me the mathematics of anatomy but he couldn't teach me the poetry of medicine.
You're made for a doctor, young man!
You're too good a man, Fettes -- I'll not let you quit.  I'll make an assistant of you -- that'll pay your keep and your tuition, too --
Well? And are you not a good student?
Richardson is a fine student.  He's got a glib tongue, but you'll be a better doctor, Fettes.  Come along now --
I can't believe that.
No room there. We'll have to set it between us.
I wanted to see the white horse --
That has nothing to do with it. We've decided to do more lecturing and less dissection -- it's better for the students -- that's all there is to it.
I suppose we can't prevent that, Gray --  -- for auld lang syne.
We have never been friends.
No, Joseph. I'm not angry -- here -- another glass of brandy --I'll wager it's better than the doctor's.
But she must be able to move. Everything is in place.
Then all my surgery is no good. There's something wrong with the child -- something I don't know -- something I can't define -- can't diagnose.  I can do nothing for her.
You're wrong.
Keep that thing away from me.
Good thing in a situation like this.
I'm not hiding. I'm right here.
It's not. I can't take it.
I don't know. I found him lying there.
Doubt is a motherfucker.
Just hold on to me.
I don't believe you.
I'm never going back in that house again. Get away.
Yes.
Yes -- of course.
That can easily be arranged.
Why don't you leave it to me? I'll think of something.
Something dramatic -- but not destructive.  It's quite an interesting problem.  Would day after tomorrow be all right? Say about noon?
I couldn't go to sleep, Mom. I had to tell you!
I followed Mr. Carpenter -- right after you left -- and, gee, Mom, where do you think he went? Right into the space ship!
Honest, Mom, I saw him. It just opened up and he walked right in. And that great big iron man was moving around!
No, I haven't, Mom. I promise you... I saw it!
Gee! How could they make a landing?
We went to the movies -- and we had ice cream cones -- and we went to see Daddy--
I am not concerned, Mr. Harley, with the internal affairs of your planet. I consider that to be your business -- not mine.
My mission here is not to solve your petty squabbles. It concerns the existence of every last creature who lives on Earth.
I intend to explain. To all the nations -- simultaneously.  How do we proceed, Mr. Harley?
Is it real?
Oh -- they just wanted to ask me a few questions. Bobby and I tried to see Professor Barnhardt in the afternoon, but he wasn't in. Apparently they thought I was looking for secrets of some kind.
Yes -- Just exactly.
I was only trying to be helpful. He was having difficulty with a problem.
Think of this more as a survival manual... there's our number on the back, and pray that you never need to call us.
Zero.
Good idea.  Marko.  We're hungry.
You're almost one of us now, Michael.
To free you, we must destroy the leader of the vampires.
Sam, don't --
Did we have a date tonight?
I better get cleaned up, then.
Okay.
I guess no one cares what I got a job.
Mom!
I hope so.
If you want your ear pierced, I'll do it.
Take laddie.
Save Laddie first.
Come on, Sam, you know before there were malls there was 'like the ocean.'
Nanook...
Nothing!  I didn't hurt him.  <u>He</u> bit <u>me</u>!  This is <u>my</u> blood!
Just listen.
I just can't comprehend any of this. It was just a dog.
Look Blair, maybe you're right about this.  But we've got to be rational. We've got to talk this over.  I'm unarmed and I'm coming in.
Wasn't enough time.  Generator was out, what...?  Thirty minutes. Takes the bastards an hour, maybe two to absorb somebody.
Clark, you want me to come in after you?!
But...
Now Copper, you tie Palmer up.
Could be important work.  Might as well bring it back.
A serum test possibly.
Don't let up, Childs!
Then get a move on.  Childs, come with me.
Why?
You crazy?  He might be inside already?
Hear what?
What kind of stories?
Excuse me?
What do you mean?
Alexander, yours is a world of brocade and velvet, not tooth and claw.  Why would you come back to this?  To save a few cattle?  No.
I just love mechanical things.
Ahhh... I'm afraid I've got a prior commitment.
You have my word...  ... She's just a beauty.
Holding you... again.
I need... to talk to you.
Not here... alone.  Please.
Let them.
I came by the house every day after the funeral.  And then every week. Then every other month.  Then I stopped coming.  Did you even notice?
It hurt me, Alex.  Very much.
Thank you...
Sir...?
I don't understand.
I know it's hard to believe, but it's true.
Allowed me to travel from my time to yours.
More than 800,000 years.
I can see Kalen's point.
What you need is an engineer.  If you set up a system of pulleys and counterweights, some basic block and tackle mechanism, you could to this a lot more easily.
What's it all for?
I mean, why do you do it?  What purpose does it serve?
Most things.  We're very high on purpose.
Or mud carriers.
What are you?
How do you decide?
My laboratory was about... here. And the kitchen was over there, where that tree is.  Mrs. Watchit wouldn't allow me in much... but, yes, this is about the kitchen.
The advances you speak of were the result of countless years of study and empirical experimentation, a careful evolutionary process, not chalkboard parlor-tricks.
Abstract mathematics, relativity of dimensions, geometrical "durations" -- even allowing for the uses of speculation, what is the point?
We can't change the day and the night, Alexander.  This is the world.
For our sake, I hope not.
That wasn't a fucking restraint.
I think you know. Your eyes say you do.
No. I'm not his son. I'm him. [Beat] What? You look like you've seen a ghost. You can come here and touch me, old man. I'm the real thing.
I never touched your father! I swear!
Mom, he just fixed our car.
What? Now you're gonna show me some kind of driver's license?
Well, you belong in one.
I know.
No. They never figured it out. I did. Most murderers don't stop to help a drunk woman and her little girl on the side of the road. Not without hurting them.
It's Sunday.
Ok.
I never knew my father. Did you?
Why?
Then help me understand. You know, you're not alone. A lot of Gulf Vets have begun to experience curious symptoms. What you have might well be a syndrome and, if so, it's not one we know enough about to be treating it this vigorously.
What for?
[Cutting in] MacKenzie, listen to me. Listen. I'm going to die.
[Gravely] No, I mean in four days, I'm supposed to die.
The Jacket.
[Beat] I'm not deaf.
No, it's fine. [Beat, swallow] Thanks.
Yeah, me too. [Softly] Every day for the last ten years.
Now that you mention it, they might have been a little bit jumpy.
Tell us about him.
Get a hold of yourself!  You are way out of your jurisdiction, now come on!  Calm down!  Don't make me sorry I let you come!
Yup.  Thanks for the ride.  You all take care.
Hi.  I'm okay.  How are you?  Long time no see.
Jimmy, my daddy's still alive and it kind of gives me the creeps when you do that...
Oh yeah.
Yeah!
Our next move?  I'll say one thing, Louise.  This is some vacation.  I sure am having a good time.  This is real fun.
Just what is that supposed to mean?
So this is all my fault, is it.
What did Darryl say?
I mean I finally understand what all the fuss is about.   This is just a whole 'nother ball game!
You know, Louise, you're supposed to be my best friend.  You could at least be a little bit happy for me. You could at least pretend to be slightly happy that for once in my life I have a sexual experience that isn't completely disgusting.
Taking a shower.
Alright, Louise!
Just ignore him.
Sorry!
But I don't know... something's crossed over in me and I can't go back.  I mean, I just couldn't live...
Yeah, right.  We're not gonna get caught.
We're not giving up, Thelma.
What are you talkin' about?
Go?
What?
I'll try to be more careful.
The thing's kind of heavy.
No, I just meant...
I'm going to fix you up with my new assistant.
What? On your day off? Do you even know the guy?
Jesus, Ted, you've got to finish that damn novel so you can quit that stupid magazine.
Hm?
Pipes? What are you talking about?
Big guy -- goes to Barrington high school.
I'm doing okay.  I gotta get ready for work.
Dumbshit.
I already know it, Mary.
It's right there on your golf bag.
Why bounce when you have your own condo in Nepal to go to?
Warren!
I'd say about a deuce, deuce and a half. Not bad.
Surprised?
Oh look, it's Doob! Will you excuse me a minute, Tucker?
What?
I don't want someone who'll put up with him. I want someone who will enjoy him, the way I do. Do you know what he told my friend Tucker? He said he would've popped the question a lot earlier if Warren wasn't in my life.  Well he is in my life and I'm goddamn lucky to have him. The hell with Steve.
Why?
Don't get ahead of yourself. You'll probably need it before I will.
No no, the bigger the better.  But I must say, they could be a little brighter. Nothing's sexier than a mouthful of pearly whites.
You mean he's not a criminal?
Who's that?
I mean he murdered someone and did time back in Boston. The guy's a freak.
Well, lucky for me I found out. Thank God I have friends like Tucker.  Look, I'm sick of talking about stalkers.  Let's talk about you.
Look, Mary, the truth is... I'll be in town for a while now but I don't think we should see each other for a few weeks.
Well... to be honest... I'm really crazy about you and it's making me nervous and when I get nervous I'm not myself and I'm afraid I'm going to doing something really dumb before we get started so I think I should just lay back until I regain my composure.
Oh yeah, that'd make golf real fun -- the guy doesn't even drink beer or gamble.
Oh.  Oh, that's a good one.
I don't mind. If you think he can hold me.
With all due respect, Mr. Secretary, we were not firing on the ship. Firing on a ship means attacking the ship. We were not attacking the ship. We were firing over it.
Yes, sir.
Somebody had to say it. I respect Adlai for having the guts to risk looking like an appeaser.
We've got bigger problems right now.
Rescind the order. Can all the Chiefs. Put Nitze, Gilpatric and the Undersecretaries in charge.
Smoke.
So I understand you correctly. If the missiles in Cuba were dismantled, returned to the Soviet Union, and a guarantee was made not to reintroduce them, the United States would be prepared to guarantee that it would never invade Cuba?
This is from the Highest Authority?
And, of course, the U.N. must be allowed to observe the redeployment of forces from the American Southeast.
Understood, sir. We need to step up the overflights, finalize our pilots' target folders in order to be able to carry out the strikes.
Well, you know how Bobby has it in for the State of Mississippi.
Then we need to do a few things right away. No Pierre. He knows, the press knows. You're going to have to keep up your schedule -- your movements are followed too closely. And we need to get these guys out of the White House. George Ball's got a conference room at State.  Reconvene over there this afternoon, come back here tonight.
Any problems, you remind them those chains of commands end at one place. Me.
Listen to me, goddamn it. We're talking about a possible nuclear war. You dropped the ball on Bay of Pigs --
You were in the room. It was your purview. It was your job to make sure Bissel wasn't fucking us over and you didn't do it. You've got the most important job in the world right now. You're the smartest guy the President has.  Besides me.
You're my hero, Carl.
Breathe, Carl. Four, nice, deep ones.
Your good friend Leo Fast Elk.
-- don't "man" me, Jimmy. Where's the key?
You ain't gonna cut his hands off and send 'em to Washinton, are ya? They done that to one of our girls once. Leo did quillwork, he's gonna need his hands.
Check him out, Ray.
One of the leaders of the Warriors of All Red Nations. Militant organization.
When did we get that?
-- I know. I fed it, and I can't get rid of --
I'm not trying to pull against you, Cooch. I've just been having nightmares about the way Leo was killed.
I just wanna make sure no one else gets done in that way because we were in bed with the wrong doer.
-- if they mine uranium there, these people will have no place left to go...
We neutralized anybody with a voice. Leo, Jimmy... Eagle Bear. Anyone who was standing in the way of the land. Is that it?
Medicine. As in medicine man?
I see. Forgive my cultural ignorance.
Jesus Christ. You're hammered. What are you doing?
Cut the shit. You shouldn't be in here, Man.
Cuz you're a cop.
What are you talking about?
And I don't give a goddamn about whether you wear a badge or not, Crow Horse, but I didn't cut you.
Uranium. Test holes. Somebody came in from the Nebraska side, and did some shotgun testin'. They're gettin' ready to suck this baby dry.
What?
We're standin' on broken treaty ground, Ray. This ain't supposed to be here. It'll poison the water.
So they took care of Leo.
You didn't have another vision...
Black Tail District, X22. You ready for this? Leo wasn't killed in the Badlands. I... I found the location.
Must be a bitch getting around in that wheelchair. How long you been in it?
At Sioux Falls Pen?
Leavenworth a tough joint?
Well, it is. It is that, too.
I could be, too.
Save you from a big mistake with that other guy.
Two miles.
It's not suffering anymore.
You're not, cause you eat frozen meatballs?    Things die. Every time you breathe, you kill millions of tiny organisms. Every time you eat, something had to die.
Somebody does. It's more honest this way. You do your own dirty work.
About as much as they think about killing me.
What do you take me for? It's a Navy Cross.
Where'd you get it.
That wasn't fair. It was a question. Penalty round!
No sir! But you have to be ready.
You.
I GOT ONE COMING UP.
Well what?
What do I want?
Any more MiGs?
Could use a dash more jet fuel.
Look, Ma, top of the world!
Wood's okay. I want Viper.
Skipper, you can't do this!
STAY WHERE YOU ARE. HE'S MINE. I'M ENGAGED. I'M IN.
Just below ten thousand.
No, really. She came ruined!... Ya think he knows it was me?
Big gamble with a thirty million dollar plane!
Kid, the plain fact is...you are. I'm not gonna stand here and blow sunshine up your ass. Technically, they absolved you. You and I know what really happened. You pushed it. You are responsible and you'll always carry that. You know what, I'll carry it too. I should have taken you out of that cockpit. I guess I'm a hopeless romantic... I always try to find something worthwhile in someone's death. It's no trade-off. It's not one for one. What you learned isn't worth his death. It couldn't be. But maybe there is some value in it. I know it's the first thing I've ever seen that's really gotten to you. Now the question is, what will you do with it. If it gets you out of flight status...so you don't kill yourself or anybody else...that's good. That's one good thing. You were an accident waiting to happen.
I didn't say that. That's up to you. I think that if you do, if you choose to come back, you'll be a better pilot... a better man.
I'll have to think about it. I don't know about them. I do know one thing, We've got a lot invested in you. We'd hate to lose it. Even more than those other guys, Naval Aviation needs a very few, very good men.
Ah, shit.  You got me.  I ain't even married.  Now put your fucking hands in the air!
May I use your pen?
No, sir.
I've been trying to tell you.  Someone erased his memory.
At Rekall.
Relax, you'll live longer.
Come on, let's go have that drink.
You blabbed, Quaid!  You blabbed about Mars!
Come on!
Aw, come on, baby...You're the girl of my dreams.
Take it easy.  Tell me exactly what happened?  Why would "spies" want to kill you?
Mars?  You've never even been to Mars.
You went to those brain butchers?!
What did they do to you?  Tell me!
Oh God, Doug.
Doug, nobody tried to kill you.
Mars.
That a problem?
I'm not interested in Saturn.  I said Mars.
There's something I have to tell you...
I used to model for 'em, why?
Enough for everybody to breathe?
That's four.  Let us know if it starts moving, Burt.
You're never going to believe this, but the canyon road...we were on it not two hours ago...well, it's completely...
Probably couldn't move too easily on the surface.
Nope, there!  That's one.
Don't matter.  They're all the same: dead weight.  Can't make a decision, can't walk because of their shoes, can't work because of their fingernails.  Make my skin crawl!
I thought you called it your pecker.  Look, don't make the mistake I made.  Twenty years of looking for a woman exactly like Miss October 1968, and where'd it get me?  Here with you.
One job I'd never take is working around electricity.
Yeah!  Next time I tell you I'm not hung up...!
Sure, Earl, everybody knows about them.  We just didn't tell <u>you</u>. Come on, nobody's ever seen one of these!  We're really <u>in</u> on something here!
First let's see if Stumpy's still out there.
Like hell you are.
<u>I'm</u> best at driving the Cat.
Road's in!  Now, soon as we hit Bixby we start making phone calls. We could make some real money off this whole thing, get in <u>People</u> magazine...
Sell the movie rights.  We're going straight from blue-collar to white -collar.
No ties.
They're tearing down the houses here!  We all gotta get outta here together!  Now!
Those scumsuckers are my radials, Pham!
You guys do all the odd jobs.
That-a-boy. Hospital.
Too fine, Badalato. The bad news is, you're gonna live.
Complain to the Bar Commission.
I had a minute before the Mapp hearing -- but I couldn't get you on the phone, Eddie...
Right, I forgot... We're pledged to protect every mid-level drug dealer in the Tri-state area.  It's an awesome responsibility.
Of course.
Right. You're right.
Eddie... I don't know about this...
1530 Rivington Street.
Chuckie's address. I sneaked a peek at the Rolodex.
...For ten years, now.
-- Me? Neither.
Have you considered that Chuckie Roeder's not calling himself Chuckie Roeder these days? Get his mugshot from one of the many law officers who've got hotpants for you... then canvass those art supplies places. We're gonna win this one, Kitty, but ya gotta believe...
"Painted"?
Good. Now we're going to take an affadavit from you, but only concerning the facts of the Chinatown shooting. We honestly don't give a shit about the Kennedy assassination.
But I'm a quick study. Tell your Deputy D.A. -- Rabin? -- that I'll see him in court.
Mr. Dowd, I was personally involved with all phases -- and principals -- of the investigation.
I'm Roger Baron. I work with Edward Dowd.
Mr. Stipe. A young man named Jimmy Chin was shot to death eight years ago, in Chinatown. Do you remember talking to the police?
It's taken care of, babe. You and I are going to make a big score tonight.  This will tide you over.
Maybe our biggest. I'll see you two doors down from your place at 11:00.
We're taking the body back to Portland and there's not a thing you can do about it.
Teresa Banks had a ring. Any idea what happened to it?
Sam, get the body and put it in the van.  Sheriff Cable, where were you the night Teresa Banks was murdered?
Oh.
What?
What happened to her?
Did you ever see Teresa take cocaine?
Do you take cocaine, Irene?
Oh.
May I see the magnifying glass, Agent Desmond?  There doesn't seem to be enough detail in the photo to ascertain the design on the ring.
Okay, I suppose I should go home.
Sure. What do you want me to call you?
Nothing.
What does Bob say?
No... No...
You were supposed to show up. Maybe I wasn't.
How can I be together if I'm not together?
James...
What?
Dad...
Laura didn't wash her hands before dinner.  And look at this.
What's with that Laura? Yeah, sure, take a look around. There's no one here anyway.
There's no one here.
It looks that way.
To get somebody from a Boston hospital to say he'll testify?
And you would come here, and on a slip of memory four years ago, you'd ruin their lives.
Dr. Towler, who was in the operating room with you?
That's what I'd planned to...
From what I've seen, Mr. Galvin, you have a very good case...
...I made a reservation at...
...What difference would...
There's nothing they can do to me.
Yes? Galvin, right?
You live in the neighborhood?
How old is he?
Ready, your Honor.
And are they going to get it?
Maybe what?
And is that what you're going to do?  Is that what you're going to do...?
Mr. Alito, please.
I have to reach him. This is an emergency. Could you give me his home number?
...Would you, would you call him up. I'll give you my number, and ask him...
I understand. Thank you, my name is Galvin. I'll be at the following number in a half an hour. It's urgent.
Dr. Gruber's not in.
He's not in, Sir.
We've got her sister. Testifies she had a meal one hour before she was admitted to the hospital. This is the point.
Admittance form is wrong.
I've got my Dr. Gruber, says her heart condition means they gave her the wrong anesthetic anyway, plus she came in complaining of stomach pains...
Not bad...? This guy's Dr. Kildare, the jury's going to love him, Mick... And you calm down, all right? Their guy, Towler's, the author of the book,  'Methodology and Practice, Anesthesiology.'  ...and they got depositions from the nurses, everybody in the operating room, the scrub-nurse... 'All these guys are God. I saw them walk on water...'  They had an obstetrical nurse in there. We got a deposition from the obstetrical nurse?
'Mary Rooney, forty-nine. Lives in Arlington, still working at the hospital.' Can you get out tomorrow? How come she isn't speaking up.
Okay now. Cases: Smith versus State of Michigan.
Brindisi versus Electric Boat.
I had a good teacher. McLean versus Urban Transport...
Yeah. I'm awake.
The Doctors.
Read me what she said.
I, what are you talking about? I talked to her this morning, and she said...
She did?
In New York?
You saw Kat in New York...  ...or is she in town? Is she in town...?
All right - I've seen enough!
I didn't know how to stop you...!
They're really for long distance. When I want to look at something close...  I take them off.
It does...Maybe that's why I feel kind of lost right now.
But they seem to murder everything that moves...!
You'll be all right with us....  ...for as long as anybody's got!
So is the town, I notice!
I just came to tell you - everyone has been alerted.
I've done about all I can do here. You go back in.  Sylvia - I like that Doctor Forrester.  He's a good man.
What?
Yes, but...
Chase. Hi...
Get her back!  I've got to go in!  Get me a full anesthetic, STAT!
Finish, please!
I like this story.
Your bed?
A story?
Kids know when something's bugging a parent.  You've got no idea who this is calling?
Big truck went right by before you opened the door.  Life on the Fault Line.
That's not what the dreams say he's doing.
Well, see, he's gotten used to being Freddy now.  And kinda likes it here in our time and space, too.  So...he's trying to cross over, from film into our reality.
Yep.
Yes, Sir.
What do you mean?
That's what they get for not locking the door.
I know.
I just can't believe it.
What's the difference?
Like you really care.  Like any of you give a shit what happens to me.
I can't watch this.
My dad.
Swear to God.  Only good advice he ever gave me.  Now, go back to sleep.
Would you, um, say it's a big storm?
He left his passport in Curacao. It's being mailed to Panama.
And, of course, we are.
What's that?
Come on, he didn't mean anything.
You know what he is talking about here?
No self respecting shark is gonna take a bite out of you.
The first thing is I don't like people talking when I'm talking so the two of you, shut up.
I hate you, you son of a bitch!!!
I don't know that anything could have prevented what happened.
You used the toilet, now you can go - what I do around here ain't any of your business, that's for sure.
Get out.
When did you talk to Lula?
She really say she was pregnant?
I ain't fuckin' sure, Bobby.
Have now.
What's the name of it?
You say it's straight ahead a mile?
Thanks.
Mr. San Pedro Sula's permit to kill.
In many capacities.
Now, Marietta, I am goin' to help you. And don't be gettin' carried away. You don't want to be bringin' Santos and his people into it.
Darlin', you ain't seein' Santos again, are ya?
Sorry, sweetheart. Bein' in love with you like I am brings out that ugly jealous side.
Sailor ain't a murderer. You got to get off that kick. And far's I can tell, Sailor was entire clean prior to that involvin' Lula. Even there he was protectin' her. You oughta be thankin' him for that. That Bob Ray Lemon they say was comin' after the both of 'em. Why am I tellin' you this, you was around that night. You ought to know just exactly what happened. Sailor just got a little too forceful is all... You remember that night...
What I made you do, mama?
But honey, I thought you told me your Uncle Pooch raped you when you was thirteen.
How'd it happen, peanut? He just pull out the old toad and let it croak?
Twenty-three months, eighteen days is all. Don't need to make more'n it was.  This couple's goin' on a date to Hawaii. The girl chose him over the other two guys.
Gift certificates to Kentucky Fried Chicken.
Hell, why should the Datin' Game be different from real life? At least them boys is gonna get somethin' to eat.
Yeah, I had my first taste on that trip to Juarez. At that age you still got a lot of energy.
Lula... I learned somethin' interestin' today on a science show I heard on the radio... How leeches is comin' back into style.
Boy, sweetie, this is weird, okay.
Oh, baby, what an idea. I'd always be happy to see you, no matter what.
Mama. I been thinkin' about her. She's prob'ly worried to death by now.
I want to call her and tell her I'm okay. That we're okay.
Pardon me? Y'all got a phone here I can use?
You think she's gonna make it?
No, I don't think so, Sail. I just need to lie down.
Lead the way.
You ain't takin' Pace, though.
What time's Sailor's train get in?
Got any plans?
Well, you be careful with that boy, Lula.
Don't mean him. It's Pace concerns me.
What if I asked you not to?
What if I told you not to?
There's no way in hell you can speak to her and...
...Yes you heard me... Don't ever call back here again.
He's great. Come on, let's blow before lo' Gran decides to boil your bones for breakfast.
Hhhuh. So we decoy her. Stick a couple pillows and one of your teddy bears under the spread and she won't know the difference.
Yeah, between a bookie and a pair of broken legs.
Just go around him.
I told you. They keep him chained in the basement. Come on.
Only now I'm starting to think the car wasn't exactly Jerry's to give.
My guess -- Vernon Hardapple.
He said a few things that lead me to believe the car's his.
'That's my car, motherfucker.'
...we find the jacket.
No wonder he screwed us over.
Excuse me?
It's mine.
You must be mistaken.
As long as it looks like her, I don't care. You know what I'm saying?
They really hated it. I think they hated it more than any of the other ones.
It doesn't matter. It only took me an hour to write.
I have trouble sleeping. While I'm lying in bed I figure them out. The stories.
I had to. Didn't I?
No! He was crazy. I didn't -- he looked -- I thought --
You're welcome.
Hm.
How can you tell?
Because of my coat?
Jealous? Of me?
Six. Their plane went down right outside Scranton.
I'm sorry about all that. I just -- I don't like to talk about my family. They treat me like a freak.  She makes me sleep in the basement of my own house. It's mine. My parents left it to me.
James'll know about George Sanders.
I told you, Sewickly Heights.
I don't know, Grady. I just dropped him on a corner.
Well. This is... surprising. Does Walter...?
You got me.
Grady.
Are you sure you parked it there?
Terry was telling me about you on the plane. It was all so interesting.
Yes?
Only when I'm working.
I might have his number on campus.
K through sixth.
Fucking Tigers. They got no pitching except for a bunch of green kids straight out of Double A or Southern Cal.  How was the party?
The birthday party.
Sure.
Cop.
Yes.
You are in.
Ms. Kramer.
I can't.
It's okay.
Honest? No.
Honest? Your cheery personality makes my skin itch.
Forget it.
Rosen? I don't have a problem with that.
I don't need someone else.
Nothing. Can I open my eyes?
I don't see --
Time.
I feel... okay.
Sorry.
Maybe later.
The morning?
What for?
I told you I'm not easily shocked.
What?
Hey, I'm not --
Walter.
What?
Do what?
What's your fucking problem?
We're being asked to cooperate in a matter of national security.  Now you know exactly as much as I do.  So just get your gear off and get up to control.  There's some kind of briefing in ten minutes.
I... they're all dead, Bud.  They're all dead. I thought... some of them... you know...
No!  I'm okay now.  I just don't... I can't go any further in.
I was worried about the rig.  I've got over four years invested in this project.
If you say so.  It could be anything.
Bud, that water's only a couple degrees above freezing.
Calm down, Bud.
Hello, Mrs. Brigman.
That's it then.  Finler, McWhirter, Dietz, and Perry.  Jesus.
Yeah, for now.  Our first priority's to get something to breathe.
Couldn't stay away.  You running mixture for us? Good.  Couldn't ask for better.
Just checking is out, huh?  How come?
You don't need to know the details of this mission... you're better off if you don't.
Mrs. Brigman, you're becoming a serious impediment to this mission.  I believe the stress is affecting you.  Escort her to quarters and have Monk prepare a tranquilizer.
What kind of luminous things, Bud?
I know how alone you feel... alone in all that cold blackness... but I'm there in the dark with you, Bud you're not alone...
What! After giving us such a run around...
It takes about twenty to twenty-two hours for the current to reach here from Lisca Bianca.
How should I be ... arrogant?
Yes, maybe that is better.
But just think -- the very same things you had said to her who knows how many times... maybe even just before we left, while I was waiting outside your place...
And aren't you pleased?... That way you'll have a new kind of adventure.
Calm?... He doesn't seem so to me... He was awake all night.
Just several days ago, the thought of Anna being dead would have made me sick. And now, I don't even cry, I'm afraid she might be alive. Everything is becoming so damned simple and easy, even to deprive one's self of pain and suffering.
Yes, you're right. I'm sick and tired of being like that.
Please, Giulia; must you always emphasize the obvious? I can see for myself that the weather is changing.
So... the boat we saw yesterday afternoon might have also been that of these smugglers. Could it be possible, then, that Anna...?
I was saying... it might even be possible that Anna had left with them.
Listen, Marshal... As for there being reasons for going away, anyone of us might have three thousand of them. So you can assume that she had them. What I want to know, is it possible that the smugglers might have taken her aboard?
But how could they pose like that? I couldn't.
Me... Goffredo, you're mad!  He's mad.
There's the Trinacria Hotel... or the Regina, near the municipal building. As for rooming houses, I don't know...
Don't mention it... Pleased to be of service any time.
Lady Patrizia!
He talked to you Himself?
Through someone else?
Who?
Why?
One of the other Sisters?
Who?
God!  But there's nothing to say about God.
Love.
Yes.
Everyone.
Right now?
I love you.
Yes.
Oh, there are so many.
Oh, yes!
Oh, I know he does.
No. But... when I look into his eyes, I can tell.
Yes.
At least once a week.
Oh, yes.
In the confessional.
A mistake...
A mistake... it was a mistake...
If you're trying to get me to say that she was a bad woman and hated me and didn't want me but that's not true, she was a good woman, a saint... 
I can't help it if I'm stupid.
Not my fault.
I was a mistake.
Everything... I don't have children.
What else?
Above the bed?  Any... anything else? What do you you see, something different?  What is it?
Do you know who put it there?
What do you think it's there for?
Are you ill?
What do you feel?
What do you do?
Agnes you won't burn in hell. It's alright to hate him.
If I find anything I'll call you.
Who told you this?
What business is it of yours..?
Look, Father, ah... just because I don't subscribe to the... to the beliefs you subscribe to...
I don't understand. Are you expecting me to..?
What?
I hate ignorance and stupidity.
I haven't said anything against the the Catholic Church.
How dare you tell me to run my affairs!
Yes.
She drank too much. That's what killed her.
I don't think I care to know.
Oh, dear God.
Oh God, if only I'd known.
I knew that after the fact.
Because I didn't know... 
Of course.
Eh?
We'd be thrown out.
Please do, I'll not need them for fifteen minutes. Thank you.
You've got an inferiority complex, you have.
No, straight up.
Sorry.
Well, what happened?
Quite right, invites to gambling dens full of easy money and fast women, chicken sandwiches and cornets of caviar, disgusting!
I'll look after meself.
We've just finished, Pauly. Hey George, write us your John Henry on this picture.
Oh yeah, he's very clean, y'know.
Foreign devil ...
Well you're not going.
Hi, our lot!
Don't be cheeky, I'll bind him to me with promises. Come on, Grandad.
Good lad, Ringo.
Shurrup, cheerful.
I've got a little list here. Wandering abroad. Malicious intent. Acting in a suspicious manner. Conduct liable to cause a breach of the peace. You name it, he's done it.
A proper Aborigine.
... I don't know...
No.  Just some horrible dreams about smothering.  Where are we?
Martin, would you run me an atmospheric?
No, I want to go in.
Unknown.
Yeah, okay.  Go ahead.
Don't know -- Broussard got hurt somehow.
Don't know -- maybe we'll be real lucky and he just broke his neck.  I knew we shouldn't of come down here.
What?
Right. 
Boy, that's terrific.
How do we locate the creature?
Should we go outside and bring him in?
I guess I had it coming.  Let's call it settled.
You will notice, though, that there are no more phases.  Only four forms are shown.  After that the pattern repeats.
Dell -- show me that on a screen.
I couldn't make it out -- too much interference.
Primitive pictorial languages are based on common objects in the environment, and this can be used as a starting point for translation...
Look --
Chaz, I've got something here on my security alert.  A high priority from the computer...
Computer, you have signalled a priority three message.  What is the message?
I don't even know what I'm looking for.
Oh well... you know me.
Look, I'm not trying to rub anybody's nose in anything.  The important thing is just to get away from here as fast as possible.
If we knew exactly what happened to the beings on the other ship --
It started crashing around right after we locked it in.
I guess we open the door and net it.
So the next step should be --
It's stable; it doesn't hurt to drop it.
Do you wanna head back and call it in?
We figured on it being a magnetic anomaly, but we ran a back-trace just to make sure.
Shit.  When?
Alright, let's keep calm.  We've got to have an option of some sort... there's got to be a way out of this.
What?
How?
Sounds great.
How many... how many people are missing?
I just... wanted to be put on my own for a while.  Clear my head.
Again?  How long before we start noticing the difference?
Yeah, 'Good Evening' to you, too.
It wasn't meant to be.
I hope you mean what you say, Eve. I intend to hold you to it.
We decided the night before last, before we came up here...
The setting wasn't romantic, but Lloyd was. He woke me up at three in the morning, banging on my door - he couldn't sleep, he told me - he's left Karen, he couldn't go on with the play or anything else until I promised to marry him... we sat and talked until it was light. He never went home...
We sat and talked, Addison. I want a run of the play contract.
Well, say something - anything! Congratulations, skol - good work, Eve!
Couldn't go on? You'll give the performance of your life.
That's all television is, my dear. Nothing but auditions.
Amen.
We know you, we've seen you before like this. Is it over - or just beginning?
I understand they've got the Indians pretty well in hand...
Huh?
I'll try.
Everybody can't be Gregory Peck.
How childish are you going to get before you quit it?
And cut that out right now.
As of this moment you're six years old...
I thought you were going to be late-
I had no idea you were even here.
That never stopped you before.
She's a girl of so many interests.
She's a girl of so many rare qualities.
So you've pointed out, so often. So many qualities, so often. Her loyalty, efficiency, devotion, warmth, affection - and so young. So young and so fair...
I've been aware of that for some time.
I'll say.
Come on, get up. I'll buy you a drink.
Margo, let's make peace.
Just being happy? Just stopping all this nonsense about Eve - and Eve and me?
But if I tell you it is - as I just did. Were you listening to me?  Isn't that enough?
Then what would be enough?  If we were married?
You've had so many reasons for not wanting to marry me... Margo, tell me what's behind all this.
I think you do know but you won't or can't tell me.  I said before it was going to be my last try, and I meant it. I can't think of anything else to do. I wish I could.  We usually wind up screaming and throwing things as the curtain comes down. Then it comes up again and everything's fine. But not this time.  You know there isn't a playwright in the world who could make me believe this would happen between two adult people. Goodbye, Margo.
A foursquare, upright, downright, forthright married lady... that's for me. And no more make believe! Off stage or on... remember, Lloyd.  I mean it, now. Grown-up women only, I might even play a mother - only one child, of course, not over eight...  Lloyd, will you promise not to be angry with me?
From what would I be running?
I'm for it.
When I told you what every young actress should know.
Your make-up's a little heavy.
You're quite a girl.
I'm in love with Margo. Hadn't you heard?
I'm only human, rumors to the contrary. And I'm as curious as the next man...
Only thing, what I go after, I want to go after. I don't want it to come after me.
You don't have to apologize for me!  I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings. It's just my way of talkin'...
How did you get in here?
You were just looking around...
What for?
Probably not.
What report? To whom?
I've heard of them.
Erasmus Hall. That's in Brooklyn, isn't it?
My husband...
But there must be some reason, something I've done without knowing...
If I thought I'd offended her, of all people-
Well - if she's got to pick on someone, I'd just as soon it was me.
Something most important you can do.
If you told him so, he'd give me the part. He said he would.
It could have been - fifteen years ago. It's my part now.
"Cora" is my part. You've got to tell Lloyd it's for me.
I hope so, Mr. Richards. Good night...
Don't bother. Mrs. Brown'll be along for it in a minute.
I find these wisecracks increasingly less funny! 'Aged in Wood' happens to be a fine and distinguished play-
It doesn't matter.
You'll be there, won't you.
I guess I didn't look. You know I don't pay attention to those things...
What are you going to wear?
And you pose as a playwright. A situation pregnant with possibilities - and all you can think of is everybody to go to sleep...
Usually at the point when she's got to rewrite and rethink them to keep the audience from leaving the theater!
I just played it.
But that was the fourth straight time.
No. You're just crazy about "Liebestraum."
Look, Miss Channing... it's kind of depressing. If you don't mind my saying so, everybody's kind of dying on the vine...
Mainly it has to do with your choice of words.
--see?--
--fifteen phone calls--
Why didn't we get that?
--you do?--with access to records?
Go on, go on--
Then tomorrow's grand jury indictments will just be bullshit.
--we will--
That happens to people.  OK, go on.
You asking would I have been one of the President's men?  I would have been.
Goddamnit!--
Well of course.
--yes--
Where are your bills, Carl?
Carl, it's a jungle.  I suggest you either pay this immediately or lay in a large supply of candles.  You'd give a stranger the shirt off your back--except it wouldn't be paid for.
--omigod, there was so much of it, six million came in one two-day period-- six million cash, we couldn't find enough places to put it. I thought it was all legal, I guess I did, til after the break-in, when I remembered Gordon got so much of it.
It was all so crazy--the day after the break-in he gave us a speech, bouncing up and down on his heels in that loony way of his--Gordon told us not to let Jim McCord ruin everything--don't let one bad apple spoil the barrel, he said. You just know that when Gordon Liddy's calling someone a bad apple, something's wrong somewhere.  ...It's all so rotten... and getting worse... and all I care about is Hugh Sloan. His wife was going to leave him if he didn't stand up and do what was right. And he quit. He quit because he saw it and didn't want any part of it.
I'm not your source on that.
How senior?
Look, I told you inside--
Do Justice and the FBI know what we know, and why the hell haven't they done anything about it?
Why didn't they?--who told them not to?
Mitchell knew then.
Haldeman too?
--this White House guy, a good one, a pro, came up and asked what is this Watergate compulsion with you guys and I said, well, we think it's important and he said, if it's so goddamn important, who the hell are Woodward and Bernstein?
--well, I've got some pretty experienced fellas sitting around, wouldn't you say so?--
--well, what if your boys get it wrong--
Woodward's onto a new wrinkle with the break-in thing--absolute page one stuff--
Could develop.
Larry Young, a California lawyer--
Of course--everything they asked--
...okay...
I'm not good in math.
Yep.
Well the same things you do.  Hang out with friends and stuff, you know, whatever.  What do you think I do?
Oh...well that's okay.  Cool.
You -- oh, you mean -- yeah, East Lansing and Ann Arbor.
Sure.
Finch, you got the Latin homework?
No -- it's true.  He is...really... big.
Jesus, Kevin, rub it in.
Do you know about the clitoris?
Sometimes it can be pretty hard to locate.
Okay, well that about covers it.
Yes!  And he was such a dork!  And everyone laughed at me, but I didn't care?  Because it was so funny!
Oh!  And then this one time?  At band camp?  I stuck a flute in my pussy.
Apple pie...  McDonald's or homemade?
Fellas, say goodbye to Chuck Sherman, the boy.  I am now a man.
Nadia, I can't --
Kevin, this is serious!
Well, I feel that...things are getting to that point in a relationship. When two people share...a special moment between them.
You want to do it?
I don't know.  How do you?
Okay.
What's that?
Dude, prom sucks.
Fuck yeah we will.
Yep.
Sure. We wouldn't ask you to do anything we wouldn't do. Now give me your hand... that's it...
No it isn't! You're dead!
In an underground club? I'd like to see that.
Go to Jim Morrison's grave at Pere Lachaise. It's overrun with American tourists. I have to work.
I know. He told me.
Fuck me...
"Stop! Beyond this passage lie the catacombs of Paris: the exclusive domain of the dead."
Shhh! Be quiet, man! We're not alone -
Go ahead Serafine. Blow him away.
Yeah, well, why did he hang out here? The cops said it's dangerous -
I told him it wasn't ready...
How well did, er, do you know him?
No. The doctors say the machines should keep him going a long time. But basically he is, how you say, a legume.
Vegetable, right. My mistake. It seems he was attacked by a maniac, maybe two or three maniacs, just after midnight. yesterday. They fled into the tunnels beneath Paris, that's all we know...
Well, here's what I think happened. A chemistry professor goes to a bad part of town late at night. Why? Perhaps he's making a few francs on the side. The psychedelic drug market is big these days. He gets mixed up with a bad crowd and, like they say, if you lie with dogs, you get fleas.
I can't! At midnight tonight, he will kill again. It's crazy!
Right. Little twerp thinks he's Colombo.
I heard it from everyone who said I didn't hear it from them!   Do you know Dmitri?
Vlad, stop acting this way! You're my friend!
Trying... to... breathe...
It's okay. Didn't hurt..
Don't worry about that now, child, it will all come back to you now that you're home...
How do you know?
He's her?
But it's not the money, Vlad.
No. Empress, you --
What?
Yeah? Allison what?
How can you possibly oversleep?
You know what a hostile gesture that is to me?
Hey, you... everybody in line at the New Yorker has to know our rate of intercourse?
All right! All right! All right! All right! Whatta yuh mean? Are yuh gonna take pictures now?
All right, here! Oh, God, it's disgusting!
Okay, that's good.
Well, uh...  You're what Grammy Hall would call a real Jew.
Yeah, well... you- She hates Jews. She thinks that they just make money, but let me tell yuh, I mean, she's the one yeah, is she ever. I'm tellin' yuh.
Yeah, yeah, I sorta dabble around, you know.
Yeah.
Oh! Italian, right?
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah?
U-huh.
Let's just do it, all right?
A bit rapidly. I don't care what you say about David, he's a perfectly fine teacher!
And what are you doing following me around for, anyway?
I just think we oughta call this relationship quits!
Oh, no, no, I think we're both much too mature for something like that.
It's all right for me, it's been terrific, you know?  Better than either one of my marriages. See, 'cause... 'cause there's just something different about you. I don't know what it is, but it's great.
I don't know.
Tsch, why don't we get... why don't we get Rob, and the three of us'll drive into Brooklyn, you know, and we show you the old neighborhood.
That'd be fun for yuh. Don't you think-
Constantly! I'd say three times a week. Like the other night, Alvy wanted to have sex.
And... I don't know... I mean, six months ago I-I woulda done it. I woulda done it, just to please him.
But the thing is-I mean, since our discussions here, I feel I have a right to my own feelings. I think you woulda been happy because... uh, uh, I really asserted myself.
I don't know, though, I feel so guilty because Alvy is paying for it, so, you know, so I do feel guilty if I don't go to bed with him. But if I do go to bed with him, it's like I'm going against my own feelings. I don't know I-I can't win.
Sometimes I think-sometimes I think I should just live with a woman.
Boy, this is really a nice screening room. It's really a nice room.
Oh, hi, Duane, how's it goin'?
Oh, yeah?  Terrific.
I'm too tense. I need a Valium. My analyst says I should live in the country and not in New York.
Okay, okay, my analyst just thinks I'm too tense. Where's the goddamn Valium?
Tell him.
Right, right, so g-get back to what we were discussing, the failure of the country to get behind New York City is-is anti-Semitism.
But the- I'm not discussing politics or economics. This is foreskin.
Don't you see? The rest of the country looks upon New York like we're-we're left-wing Communist, Jewish, homosexual, pornographers. I think of us that way, sometimes, and I-I live here.
Sun is bad for yuh. Everything our parents said was good is bad. Sun, milk, red meat, college...
M'hm.
Whee, you shoulda told me it was Tony Lacey's party.
His wife has diabetes!
No.
Yeah.
Yeah.
She's got great tits.
And you've only just met.
Absolutely.  And she's got great tits.
The camera loves her.  A great actress.
Borrow whatever you like.
Whatever you like.  I'm afraid it'll all be too big for you.  Are you alright, Clair?
I'd say it was down.
You want a Tylenol, or something?
Why would she care?
You need to knock off the pills, Clair.
It's not going to come up.
Fuck you.
Anymore.
Monica.
We live next door.
Excuse me?
You have?
Probably not.
Happy anniversary.
You can never be too early or too thin.
I'm worried about my spine.  I'm very worried about my brain and my spine.
Okay.
I guess.
Me too.
Me too.
Ah there's our snookums now.
I don't think so.  I feel.  I feel a bit funny.
Time!
Don't go in, Ryan.
Let's just go home, okay?
Not to mention Andrew Zhdanov... Otis, come!!
Who doesn't know about the infamous composer's conference of 1948 where Zhdanov persecuted the leaders of Soviet Music - Shostakovich, Prokofieve, and Myaskovsky.
Do Peter Sellers again.
I just did a movie about Bob Yar, I played Gittle, the Jewish milkmaid who gets shot in the head, and they used Shostakovich's 13th Symphony.
Exactly!  So I dug it, and I did a lot of research.
Yeah.
If he were still alive, maybe.
Are you asking me to marry you?
Very.
Who told you that?  No.  I'm twenty...  Five.
From Jewish Folk Poetry, a song cycle...
I don't mind...
This colony needs another tunnel like a hole in the ground.  Why are we even digging this thing?
Wanna dance?
I CAN'T DANCE WITH A WORKER!
Quiet -- sshhh!!
SSHH!!!  SSHH!!!
Cut me down a soft leaf so I can take a nap.
Oh no...
Yeah.  Well -- no.  She's kind of playing hard to get.  As a matter of fact, she's playing completely unattainable.  So, what's on the schedule?  A brisk walk?  a foraging expedition?
Attack?  But -- I hate attacking! It's so hostile!
I've never seen anything like it, General, they're they're...well, look!
Yes, and do you know <u>why</u> there's a food shortage?
Negatory.  <u>Too many ants</u>.  And while we soldiers go out there, and fight, and bleed, and die for the colony, the namby-pamby workers live it up back home.
YES!!!  You know, people ask me, "Doctor, why are you always happy?" And I tell them it's mind over matter.  I don't <u>mind</u> that I don't <u>matter</u>!  Do you get it?  Do you get it?
I can't think of any.
Will you introduce me to some worker girls?
Maybe I'll get lucky.  You know, Z, I wouldn't do this for anyone but you...
Eggs he asks me for. Oranges. What you need is a good horse-whipping.
From me the doctor has no secrets. Poor girl -- how could you do a thing like that?
Big shot! For you, I wouldn't lift a finger -- but for her, I'll fix a little something to eat.
I hope so.  Wouldn't you know they'd call me on a day like this -- with my cold and everything --  How do I look?
Nothing.  There are just too many people here.
I just want to go brush my teeth --
A bad insurance risk?
A cemetery?
Gin.
I wonder how long it takes to get someone you're stuck on out of your system? If they'd only invent some kind of a pump for that --
Aren't you meeting Mr. Sheldrake?
That's very wise.
Good night, Miss Kubelik.
Mr. Dobisch said that?
Well, you know how it is -- things pile up.
That's very flattering.
Oh, yes, sir. Very much. And I want to thank you --
Thank you, sir.
Oh, yes.  She's the best operator in the building.
Maybe you're using the wrong approach.
Could be she's just a nice, respectable girl -- there are millions of them.
I'm all out of liquor -- and there's no clean glasses -- no cheese crackers -- no nothing.
Yes, Mr. Dobisch.
How many pills were in that bottle?
Oh, I'm fine, Doc.
Good night.
The party's over.
It's an emergency -- see you some other time.
You can't sleep.  Come on, Fran -- open your eyes.  Let's get her walking. We've got to keep her awake for the next couple of hours.
I love you -- remember?
First you can't wait to get me up here, and now -- rush, rush, rush! Makes a person feel cheap.
What guy?  Whose apartment is this, anyway?
I'm not that fond of blondes -- maybe I like brunettes --
I like all of them --
I said I like all of them.
I'm sure it is, but I had hepatitis.
No.
Yeah. Way north.
None.
Sort of.
I don't know.
I'll go with you in a while -- judt hold tight awhile --
I'll go with him --
When'd you do it?
I wonder if that was the same copter.
Charlie?
We took them from the dead.  Now -- I assume you want to rest, to shower. We'll attend to your repairs after dinner.
I haven't surfed since I got here.
Hell's Angels Four to Big Duke Six -- we'll need green smoke -- suggest you have the FAC mark it.
Yes, I know.
No water.
Which one's the Colonel's?
Why?
We'll be needing some supplies and fuel -- do you know anybody who can give me a hand?
What is this bridge?
The river is beautiful.
You can pack out of here -- two, three days' hike along this river at most.  Weather should hold this early in the season.
134  CONTINUED:  
How?  Nobody this far north monitors that frequency until avalanche season.  Besides, I'm surprised a tough guy like you uses fancy electronics.
28   CONTINUED:
He still might be around.  I saw fresh tire tracks coming in.
Come here...
I know.  Least you didn't shoot all of them.
I needed a pilot's license to take the job here, so I got one in six weeks.
It wasn't my idea to crash the plane.
We've got another two hours of daylight.
Where's my ELT?
You got one?
Too bad.  We'd be out of here in a few hours.
Lets us watch each other's backs over a wide area.  Only thing messed me up this time was getting arrested in the baths. ELT was in my duffel bag, not around my neck where it should've been.
You left a footprint at the Sportsmen's camp.  Only pretty sight there, Ben, 'cause the two men you didn't shoot and mutilate died of exposure.
Yeah.  Sorry I barked at you last night.
That's what we should've done in the first place.
Quit fucking around.  Get in.
On a good day I couldn't spare a crosswalk guard.  But now, no way.  Folks're batshit with the weather turning sour.  Bring him in yourself.
Sit your suspect out in the cold. He'll keep.
So shoot him.  Won't have to feed him that way --
No, I didn't.  So why are you h...
You're gonna die soon with that diet, you know that?
How do you know about my mother?
Yes. I'm going to give my queer neighbor a lift to Baltimore.
Hey, what I did for you is working out?
You like sad stories -- you want mine.
Fries.
What do you mean? You said you liked it.
This one has a special meaning.
I'm gonna grab you.  I didn't mean it to be a question. I'm gonna grab you.
You think you're kidding.
What I know is that as long as you keep your work zipped up around me, I don't give a fuck what or where you shove your show. Are we being neighbors for now?
Like the wind but I'm not doing it.
I'll be able to keep my apartment and studio, won't I?...  Just tell me.
Do you realize that I work at him?
Do you like to be interrupt when you are danging around in your little garden?
Well, I work all the time. So never, never again interrupt me. Okay? I mean, never. Not 30 years from now... not if there's fire. Not even if you hear a thud from inside my home and a week later there's a smell from in there that can only come from a decaying body and you have to hold a hanky against your face because the stench is so thick you think you're going to faint even then don't come knocking or, if it's election night and you're excited and want to celebrate because some fudge-packer you dated has been elected the first queer President of the United States... and he's going to put you up in Camp David and you just want to share the moment with someone...  don't knock ...  not on this door. Not for anything. Got me. Sweetheart?
Okay, then.
But sick -- nauseous -- where everything looks distorted and everything inside just aches -- when you can barely get up the will to complain.
Look, I've got to get a hold of Frank and see where I'm hanging my hat 'cause...
The fact that you haven't said, "hold it" means I haven't done it right...  is that correct? I haven't done it right?
No fucking way.
I know you're going to jump.
Do you want Rath or not?
Tomorrow.  The buyer is Japanese. His retirement a condition of the bonus.
Where are we going?
Another contractor.
No.  They hired Bain.  The contract would have been mine, but Bain took it from me as he took the previous one.
He stole the contract knowing that I would come after him.
Because he is trying to retire me.
Yes.
The nature of the business.  You remove your competition.
Yes.
We don't have a choice.
He was killed.
I don't know... maybe I'll live on a boat, sail to all the places I've never been.
Check.
But he won't shoot you right then?
What?
Why?
I'm playing white, remember.  You can't tell me which pieces to move. It doesn't work that way.
Yes.  Please come in.
Yes.
That's correct.
American currency.
I have all day.
Yeah right!....I don't know, something isn't right with this place, it's all too sterile and staged. Do you ever wonder why there's no Czechs here?
Yeah, but it's not just that. To the Czech mind, any movement, whether political or literary should be underground. If it isn't, then it's not radical and not worthy of a look-in.
No you don't get it. Every cabby in town knows this joint. So where's the mystery, the danger?
An alternative literary venue!
No, it's the whole idea behind it. How did they get this place?
Right and not just the bar, Lubosh and his mates took the whole freakin' building.
He was an electrician?
That makes you an expert I guess.
But how did the wall get here?
Am I late?
Who put a bee up your butt?
We could make a start on the floor afterwards.
What?
No, but I ran into Jahn, seems him and his friends are in big trouble with the University, they might even be expelled.
Did you see a lawyer and go before a judge?
What happened?
You're kidding.
WE gotta think of something.
I could try and get a Western lawyer.
What?
What are you talking about?
Josh didn't get Doug out of jail, he did a deal in return for some computer disks we'd held onto.
Doug, haven't seen you for a while.
Have you met Holly? Josh's friend.
Sure. Excellent.
No I'm not, I came to Prague looking for something - this could be it!
It's bad news when you can't even bribe kids.
There's nothing there for me.
Don't worry. Thanks.
I don't know - maybe they are talking about it now. Mr Vitovetch is a good friend of the Judge.
No, it should be over soon.
Of course, you can see that lady over there, she is recording everything.
I will tell you - within a week I will have the transcript and we can go through it.
I'll be okay, just get me home.
Yes, they had nothing to do with it.
That's right.
Fuck you!
Yes, you are free to go, Karel here will drive you home.
Well come on, sit down.
This press we cannot control. Americans, I think.
In a building belonging to the University in the Old Town.
The files are in a sealed room and the University are under strict orders to stay away.
Because she doesn't know what a hint is.
Late night.  You?
Yeah.
No thinking. The doctor only gives you three seconds to decide --
Landon Carter. I was driving the car that --
Me.
Then we both know.  I'll point. You drive. Faster.
I do know.  Be two places at once... learn to hit a baseball or turn a cartwheel... eat breakfast with chopsticks...
The dirty snowball at its core.
In 76 years, me neither.
Healthy as can be.
I heard what you did. Thank you.
That what's happening to you, only faster?
Where?
Me.
All the time.  I feel like I have no one.
That was read at my parents' wedding.
No.
It was a play.
I have expectations, too.
Ever again.
Yes. You?
-- You can and you will, Mr. Carter.
I don't know. National Cash Register?
School? I never thought of school! If I went to school I could blend in with everybody else, couldn't I?
Eileen, Chinese food again?
Christ, it's a miracle I was even born! 
Nothing. Look, I'll write it down for you, okay?
All I can say is, that's one helluva attitude, Mr. McFly. 'Let's explode a hundred megaton Geothermal nuclear device, just to see it.'
Home, school, here... 
Precisely! 
Must have been? Used to live? I do live here.
What if you lost your keys?
Hey, look, gimme a break! All I did was answer the door! How's that gonna change history?
Good. Professor Brown tested the tarp, noting in satisfaction that it was secure. I'll pick you up in front of the school at midnight. Don't be late -- we're cutting it close as it is. We've got a long drive ahead of us.
According to your girlfriend, Suzy Parker, you and she were at the movies. You went to the restroom and you never came out. Obviously, you stepped through an inter-dimensional time warp, created by the original operation of the time machine.
What's going on?
Sometimes. The other day, though, an old boy was plowing in the field over there, found some old Spanish coins.
Tom...
Thanks.
I know you do. Good luck to you, too.
It's okay.
There's an old Fudgesicle over there. You want it?
I'm fine. Kind of tired.
Well, why you always walking behind me?
Nothing... I was just running off at the mouth... as usual.
Stay as long as you like.
Beats me.
I'm assigning a couple Blue Shields to protect you around the clock, just in case.
Buckaroo, somebody shanghaied the Professor!
Let her out. In my custody.
At least tell them I'm trying!  Tell 'em something--!
Just their side.  What're we gonna do with these people?  They're illegal aliens, the way I figure, been here forty years, you could throw the book at 'em...
I don't know. I always felt like I did, like there was another me...
Somewhere.  See I was taken away by the Priddies when I was a baby.  I was adopted.
What?  I don't understand you.  I don't understand anything anymore.
You're gonna have to repeat that, I think, Buckaroo.
I didn't drop 'em.
She's just a damn road hugger, Allison.  Plus the man can drive.
If I can. He gets jealous; he-
Not anything, Bill. Don't test me.
...Once or twice. His name is Charlie Meadows.
And what would that be, son?
No son, thisahere moonshine's got nothin' to do with shuttin' folks out. No, I'm usin' it to build somethin'.
I'm buildin' a levee. Gulp by gulp, brick by brick. Raisin' up a levee to keep that ragin' river of manure from lappin' at m'door.
Don't panic, I'll join you in a minute.  What's you think of Richard and Poppy?
Hell no! Call me Charlie. Well Barton, you might say I sell peace of mind. Insurance is my game  door-to-door, human contact, still the only way to move merchandise.
Seen a doctor?
...Yeah, okay.
I guess the heat's sweating off the wallpaper.
Have to, old timer. Just for a while.
That's okay, that's okay, that's okay  that's just fine. You probably just walked in here thinking that was going to be a handicap, thinking we wanted people who knew something about the medium, maybe even thinking there was all kind of technical mumbo- jumbo to learn. You were dead wrong. We're only interested in one thing: Can you tell a story, Bart?  Can you make us laugh, can you make us cry, can you make us wanna break out in joyous song? Is that more than one thing? Okay.  The point is, I run this dump and I don't know the technical mumbo-jumbo. Why do I run it? I've got horse-sense, goddamnit. Showmanship. And also, and I hope Lou told you this, I bigger and meaner than any other kike in this town. Did you tell him that, Lou? And I don't mean my dick's bigger than yours, it's not a sexual thing  although, you're the writer, you would know more about that. Coffee?
Lou.
I had to call Beery this morning, let him know we were pushing the picture back.  After all I'd told him about quality, about that Barton Fink feeling. How disappointed we were. Wally was heartbroken. The man was devastated. He was  well, I didn't actually call him, Lou did. But that's a fair description, isn't it Lou?
Nine days  Tuesday 
Ya see how he's not writing it down?
This man creates for a living! He puts food on your table and on mine! THANK him for it!  Thank him, you ungrateful sonofabitch! Thank him or YOU'RE fired!
Did you find out about her parents?
You know I'm whacko, Sam, what'd you find?
Baby-sitting.  Rookie cop.
She knows stuff about me that only you know.
What was she like in school?
Put your hands up!
It won't last.
Thanks.
There's a name from the past.
What do you want from me, Catherine?
Do you want her to join us sometime?
No?
No.
Exactly what do you have in mind, Mr. Corrigan.
No.
What was the weapon?
Were there ever any suspects?
Was his wife ever a suspect?
Routine.
Do you remember his name?
Nilsen?
Nothin'  I'll be okay, pop.
Maybe it wasn't her that paid him. Maybe the money was for somethin' else.  How the fuck do I know? I'm just an old city cowboy tryin' not to fall outta his saddle.
Maybe she did, Gus.  Maybe she grew herself an Afro and learned a left hook and put shoe polish on her face.  Let's polygraph her again and ask her about it.
You forgot her degree in literature. She's a writer.  She published a novel last year under a pen name. Do you want to know what it's about?
Gus and I talked to her at Tramell's house.  All we did was write her name down.
Yeah.  But you didn't tell me to stay away from her car.
He was shot.
Yeah, I met her already.
That would be a pity because you're a real painter.
Sure.
I need a dealer.
Out?
I am... On Gina.  Fuck  I didn't think we were actually gonna do this.
Good. What do you have?
'Uppity?' Like as in 'uppity nigger?'
You don't have any fucking money..
How is he?
Hi.
You like your dad's paintings?
Stand still.
Tony Bennett... What do you mean?
I didn't know Tony Bennett painted.
Yo... You know why Rammellzee's here, don't you?
I'm here for an interrogation. You've been called a graffiti artist and I wanna know why. All I see are scribble scrabble abstractions!
"Shreck's."  You --
Better than you know, Bat-boy.
Ah, the direct approach.  I admire that in a man with a mask.  But you don't really think you'll ever win, playing it your way ..?
"We"?  You and...
Yes and no...
Damn those Carny bolsheviks the other night, throwing bricks at my windows --
Weird, huh?
Down, Oswald.  We have to talk.  You see we've got something in common.
Batman.  The thorn in both our sides, the fly in our ointment.
Women... nothing surprises me, Chip. Excepting your late mother... Who even knew Selina had a brain to damage?  Bottom line:  she tries to blackmail us, we drop her out a higher window.  Meanwhile I got badder fish to fry.  Yeah -- Oswald, please.
Yes, adulation is a cross to bear. God knows <u>I</u> know.  But someone's got to supplant our standing-in- the-way-of-progress Mayor and don't deny it, Mr. Cobblepot, you've got the magic!
I'm no cat.  I'm just an assistant. A <u>secretary</u> --
Too good?
Too late for what, dear child?
I have been part of the greatest adventure ever know.  I have found purpose here, and the family I could never have.
No, my boy.  I'm afraid none of us can.
Rather disappointed at how poorly I taught you proper housekeeping.  And quite well, it seems.  Thanks to you, son.  Thanks to you all.
Batgirl, Baatgirl, Baatgirl.
Nightwing.  Scourge of darkest evil.
It's the gear.  Chicks love the gear.
Just the beast.
Umm.  What I mean is...no plans at the moment...
We gonna trap ourselves a snowman?
Whoa, I made a mistake.  I'm sorry. Don't go all protective on me.  It won't happen again.
I'm fine.  See.  Me.  here.  Alive. How are we gonna work together if you're never going to trust me?
I wonder if I can get a cell with a view of the gardens?
Not good.
Hello, Jason.  I think I've had a change of heart.
Which `they' might that be, sir?
How come this is the only locked door around this museum? What's back there?
No more tricks, Edward. Release Chase and Dick. This is between you and me.
Somebody's been sending me love letters. Commissioner Gordon thought you might give me your expert opinion.
Sorry. I haven't even had time to unpack. Instant coffee okay?
Oh God, Bruce, you were a child. You weren't responsible.
What?
What are you talking about?
Can't tell if you don't say please.
You _are_ Two-Face, you would need to face both rivers, both uptown and downtown simultaneously. Only one spot in Gotham serves these bi- zonal, bi-coastal needs...
Oh yes, and certainly _WE_ will!
Take me. Let the boy go.
What are you talking about?
Look, I appreciate what you did for me. But this is my job. And I'm keeping those pictures.
How do I know you won't keep them all?
Bruce Wayne.  -- I've read your work.  I quite like it.
I might consider it if you introduce me to Miss Vale.
Vicki, if I say anything cryptic, or... ambiguous, I think you should put the most flattering possible interpretation on it.  Because even if it doesn't sound that way... that's how I'll mean it.
Very thoughtful. Don't touch it.
WHAT?
WHAT??
Do you want this money or don't you?  Now shut up!  Shut up --
Ten million dollars. Ten mi -- YOU CHEAPSKATES! I've just wiped out the stock market. I've cost you billions!  I want ten million and one.
Goddammit, I expect to be treated like and ARTIST. GET OFF MY SCREEN!!
A girl could get killed - - so they tell me.  What's new and hot in Gotham City?
Evildoers, huh?  Big or small?
Our next D.A. -- I hear Bruce Wayne is throwing a fundraiser.  Did you get your invitation yet?
Oh, Bruce...
Sounds great.  Excellent.  Though-, Ahm... there's this guy who's coming to work at the Gallery, from England...
And they asked me if we'd like to ... you know... put him up for a while.
Yes, there are hotels.  They just thought maybe it'd be nice for him to stay with a real American family.  Popcorn, waffles, all that stuff.
I said I'd check with you.
Your face smells like a foot.
No, I'm fine.
Ahm.....
Yes.  Ahm.  I was just wondering where my English house guest had got to.
Great - keep him out of trouble.
Okay, sir.  Certainly.  Good.
Certainly is.
Not in one piece anyway.  I see Mrs Whistler as kind of ... like my own dear mother.  I'd kill any man that tried to interfere with her.  The Vice President here will vouch for that.
Hi, Grierson, forgive the war paint.  Going on To my regiment/s reunion after.
Entert-ain...us...an-us...Oh yeah! Heh heh. Anus. Heh heh.
Aggghg! We're gonna die! We're all gonna die!
Me first!
My butt's bothering me!
Dammit!!!! Dammit!!!!
Could you, like, tell her we're ready to score?
That's alright. I'd rather not know your real names anyways. I'm Muddy. Look, I'm gonna get right to the point. I'll pay you ten grand plus expenses, all payable after you do her...
He's jerkin' us off. I think we're gonna have to take him out. Get ready to fire on my orders...  This is your last chance. Give us the unit now...
OK boys. Get ready to fire on the count of three.  I'm gonna give you three seconds...
D.C., Chief.
Holed up. Huh huh huh. Holed.
Well, then you know what I'm talking about. Anyway, here's the story. I scored with these two chicks. True story.
Yeah, they were sluts. Huh huh huh.
Ah, the ever-tactful Jane.  Let's just relax about having children.
This book isn't arranged that way. What do you want to know?
I don't see anything about 'Rewards and Punishments' or 'Heaven and Hell.'  This book reads like stereo instructions!  Listen to this... 'Geographical and Temporal Perimeters... Functional perimeters vary from manifestation to manifestation.'  This is going to take some time.
Not really...  what's this?
It's <u>not</u> stupid.  We're ghosts. Do you want this woman for breakfast for 125 years?  Moan louder!
Go?  What d'ya mean?  We need help.
All right.
I got it.  And I took pictures of the new church for you, too.
Now, let's get rolling!
Hey, I've been in a frigging bottle for six hundred years.  I was out.  Every dog has his day. This is my town.  I need a night to howl.
You're not gross.  Why were you wearing a sheet?
They're dead.
That's fine, Otho.  Just keep me out of it.  I am here to relax and clip coupons.  And goddamnit, I mean to do it.
Lydia, we're the first trickle! In a couple of years this whole town will be <u>filled</u> with people like us.
I cannot believe this.
I <u>told</u> them you were too mean to be afraid.
Viridian?
Oh, they're still here.  They're Just not showing up.
That's slavery and murder.  You don't know these people.  They're just like you and me.  They're nice people!
It's fine today, Robert.
We have common foes, Chauncey - kid lawyers and our physician!
And what do the boys around Intelligence think?
Gentlemen, needless to say, there is going to be a full Congressional investigation of your respective operations.  Good night.
My name is Chance.
No. I'm a gardener.
No, Eve. I'm not related to Basil and Perdita.
Hello, Eve.
Yes. It's feeling much better now.
Fine. He's very nice.
Yes, Eve. I know that.
Hello, Sid.
No. I'm not busy.
The President is a nice person. I enjoyed it very much.
I think you should ask Mr. Rand that.
Yes, that is correct. I think you should ask Mr. Rand that.
Oh, good.
Yes, it is.  Would you tell me your name again, please?
Yes. I like that name very much.
Yes, I'm sure it is. That's what they say, anyway.
I like to watch.
Yes. I like to watch very much.
I want to tell Eve.
Yes.
It is quite amazing how those clothes have come back into style.
Yes sir, I guess that's true smallest room in the house.
Yes. I was there with Ben.
Yes.
Yes, I know the garden very well. I have worked in it all my life. It is a good garden and a healthy one; its trees are healthy and so are its shrubs and flowers, as long as they are trimmed and watered in the right seasons. The garden needs a lot of care. I do agree with the President; everything in it will grow strong, and there is plenty of room in it for new trees and new flowers of all kinds.
No, Thomas. But I have seen the Army on television.
As long as the roots are not severed, all is well and all will be well in the garden.
That is correct. In a garden, growth has its season. There is spring and summer, but there is also fall and winter. And then spring and summer again...
Hello, Sophie.
We have nothing on him, Ambassador Skrapinov.
Sorry, Comrade Ambassador.
There is no information available on the man before he moved into Benjamin Rand's. It has proven to be such a difficult task that it has resulted in the loss of one of our agents to the United States Government.
Yes, I did.
Overall - pretty good. But, Mr. President, I think it's very dangerous to resort to temporary measures at this stage of the game.
I sympathize with your position, Mr. President, I know how difficult it is to be straightforward, the reaction to such a speech could be chaos.
Exactly that. We can put you inside someone else's body for fifteen minutes.
Brain. soul, I'm telling you, Lotte. I was right inside him looking out. We're going to be rich.
What?
Well, you know we're going to be very busy tomorrow. I'll tell you what. Let's do it tonight. Right now.
Yeah. We'll do it right now. On the way to Lester's house.
Fuck Maxine.
Holy shit, yes!
Holy shit! He said what I said!
I wasn't toying with her, sir. I was just... How old are you?
I'll keep that in mind, sir.
The elderly have so much to offer, sir. They are our link with history.
Dr. Lester, while I am flattered that you share your feelings with me, I believe perhaps the workplace is not the most suitable environment for this type of discussion.
My tits?
Christ, you're not a fag are you? Because I don't want to be wasting my time.
Sounds good. Oblique but intriguing. Phone it in.
Hello. Wendy.
It's an interesting story, Wendy. Many years ago in the late 1800's, James Mertin, an Irish ship captain looking to invest in the future of our great country, came to this town and decided to erect an office building.
Well, if Mantini wins, Schwartz will leave Malkovich, right? So, if he needs it, I help Mantini's performance a bit, give him an edge. Spice up the show.
I am the Devil, Lester. I think I can handle it.
Fine. Let's drop it.
Fine. I'm not mad. Let's just drop it.
Craig stole Maxine from me, Dr. Lester.
No, you don't understand. I've been inside Malkovich when I'm with Maxine...
No, I didn't know that.
No.
I love you, Lotte.
Oh sure. It's very rewarding...
No!  But how will we make a living, my love, if our clientele doesn't have access to our product?
No! Please!  Shut up, will you? We're trying to think here.  It is sort of like being a puppeteer. I like that about it.
Wait a minute! What if everybody knew? What if we presented Malkovich as the world's most complicated puppet and me as the only puppeteer sophisticated enough to work him? We'd wipe the floor with the Great Mantini!
What want ye, girl child?
I see. Well, it is not my fault that thou art tiny. So if it is charity yer after, then be gone with ye, ye foul demon.
Aye. Speak then if ye must.
..."Here. Look here. See this mark? If you can't tell me by my face, look here."
Don't pay to complain.
No. Got me an afternoon job at the shirt factory. Figure between that and my night work at the Bodwins I might be able to put something away for me and mama.
More than all right. Miss Bodwin, she teach me stuff..Book stuff. She says I might go to Oberlin. She's experimenting on me.
No, let her rest.
I'll make sure she does. But first I'm going  make up a nice, big breakfast against that cold outside.
Don't matter. First time I'll be late in nine years. No great trouble..Whatever goes on out there goes on with or without me showing up on time... don't matter...  The world is in this room, baby. This is all there is and all there needs to be.
Ain't no new Negroes in this town I don't know about. What she look like? You sure that wasn't Denver?
You sure?
Might see anything at all at 124.
Better ask Paul D.
He's sleeping in the church.
Yeah. Asked Rev. Pike if he could stay in the cellar.
Can't nobody read minds long distance. All he have to do is ask somebody.
Unrile yourself, Stamp. It's only a few days he been there.
He ask, I give him anything.
I don't know him that well.
Stamp, don't tear me up this morning! I don't feel like it.
Her who?
Hold on! Don't jump if you can't see bottom!
She left me. She's gone again.
She was my best thing.
It's the LeBaron.
I'm not a--ah, fuck it, just stay away from my fucking lady friend, man.
She's not my special lady, she's my fucking lady friend.  I'm just helping her conceive, man!
Who're you working for?  Lebowski? Jackie Treehorn?
The?  Who the fff--
We have the urn.
I'm going home, Donny.
Thank you, Donny.
I told that kraut a fucking thousand times I don't roll on shabbas.
WELL THEY CAN FUCKING UN-POST IT!
Shut the fuck up, Donny.  Not a bunch of fig-eaters with towels on their heads tryin' to find reverse on a Soviet tank.  This is not a worthy--
One a those days, huh.  Wal, a wiser fella than m'self once said, sometimes you eat the bar and sometimes the bar, wal, he eats you.
Far from it.
Relax, man!  No physical harm intended!
Hey, relax man, I'm a brother shamus.
Huh?  Autobahn.  A-u-t-o.  Their music is a sort of--ugh--techno-pop.
Exactly.  What happened to your face? Did Jackie Treehorn do that as well?
This is a league game.  This determines who enters the next round- robin, am I wrong?
Huh?
What'd he say?  Where's the hand- off?
Huh?
Yeah yeah, "kill that poor woman."
Hardly Dude, a new 'vette?  The kid's still got, oh, 96 to 97 thousand, depending on the options.  Wait in the car, Donny.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Dude, I'm--it was an accident!
I understand sir.  Could you slide your shorts down please?
Where's the money, Lebowski?
Over the line, Smokey!  I'm sorry. That's a foul.
Excuse me!  Mark it zero.  Next frame.
This is not Nam.  This is bowling. There are rules.
You're missing the point.  Their vampire victims don't die.  They turn.  They become carriers.  If the Reapers continue unchecked, there could be thousands of them before the month is over.  Do the math.
If that's true, what about Nomak?  He's been alive longer than the others.
Pain cuts the deepest, isn't that what you said?
Ran into a little Reaper trouble myself.
So?
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer.  Isn't that how the saying goes?
Nomak said something to Blade in Greek. Athelfiki singenia ex amato.  Where did he learn that?
You experimented on your own, son?
Look, kid, they obviously found your base of operations.  If it was a trap, why flip their dicks by announcing themselves?
Don't even start, old man.
You're wrong -- a few minutes more, and my transition will be complete. Even your sword won't be able to affect me then.
I don't care what you believe. I saved your life once, I don't plan on making a habit of it. You want my advice, you'll be out of the city by nightfall. If you're stupid enough to stay, that's your business.
Not anymore. You've seen one of them. You won't be allowed to live after that.
He will.
Cancer.
Yes you will. The human side of you is stronger. I know it is.
It's not a joke. I've got the stiff sitting in the morgue right now -- look, just come up and see him, okay? Five minutes, that's all I ask.
This is purely professional curiosity, Karen, I swear.
Please. You and the other Elders wouldn't know what to do with these texts if your lives depended on it.  Which, of course, they do.
Perhaps.
Some of the old wives' tales are true -- they're severely allergic to silver, various types of wood. Feed them garlic and they'll go into anaphylactic shock --
I'll take my chances.
My eye, is there something in my eye?
Mrs. Leavitt--
Let's talk to your husband--
No. What's it doing here in the middle of the foundation?
She <u>is</u>--she's helped solve a bunch of murders: Arizona, New Mexico--
I don't know. Nightmare.
Yes.
I can't.
--no, you're not. You love me too much. You don't want to see them kill me.
Both. Now.
Back it up, rewind, whatever you call it.
That's what Josh and Mike said.
Not a great idea. Especially 'cross the street.
--I look and look in the tree, all I ever see, he's always there watching, that stupid owl, over and over--
--anywhere, anywhere, all up and live, all the time--fucking owl--
--hell, I don't think I'm ever leaving this place again--
I'm not finished.
Spite.
Enough to keep sane.
Ancient runes--
Hmm? I dunno. Chafing from the backpack, something.
Then I have no idea.
That's why she kills children.
Domini.
--why in the world would she just fly the coop in the first place?
There are <u>other</u> explanations! She is not the goddamn witch, that's insane!
I don't....
No Meurice, it's worse than that. Something really happened, I think Marty's dead--
Sort of...
I couldn't believe it either...
Yeah.
In the trunk.
We don't seem to be communicating--
I own the place.
I'm not surprised, the company you've been keeping the last ten years.
Am I fired? You wanna hit me? What?
Well... if you're not gonna fire me I might as well quit.
I didn't say that.  Well?
What do you think?
Then you shouldn't have done it. Can't have it both ways.
No, you do, cowboy. You been to the bar?
Sometimes it helps to talk things over. for instance, many marriages are saved by.
I understand. I'm just real curious like you said.
It must be great.
Does Dorothy know her husband is dead?
Oh my God. Is her son OK?
Yeah.
See my nipples?
You can kiss them if you want. Fell them . They're getting hard.
Who's it, you mean.
Frank would open you.
Does that scare you?
Beeeee careful.
What if Frank came over here and found us?
It's okay. it's okay.
Okay Frank.
I'm here, aren't I?
Ooooo, you are smart. Just don't get too smart.
That sounds good.
Okay, Sandy.
Nothing. really! It's good to see you.
Where to?
I'd rather not talk about it. I'll tell you about it sometime.
... You look beautiful.
I like that idea. that's a real good idea.
Hey Jeff.
Is something wrong? What's happened to your face?
You can't just stay out half the night and carry on, Jeffrey. There's got to be some order, Jeffrey. I thought it would have been nice to call your father when you got home but now it is much too late.
Sure thing. please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes?
My pleasure, Augusto.  Diego has told me much about you.
What is?
You happy, baby?
I know it's not the greatest.  It's commercial.
It's your grass.
Yeah.  I understand.  Just business. Right.  Fuck you.
And that's wholesale.  Cut it a few times and retail, you're looking at two, three-hundred thousand.
Yes.  And a kilo of coca is smaller than a kilo of your precious marijuana. Everything is the same, George, except instead of thousands, you are making millions.
Now do you see what I am saying?
Don't worry.  We will talk of everything.  We have the time.  You arrive here with a Bachelor of Marijuana, but you will leave with a Doctorate of Cocaine.
Just sell it, Derek.
I'm driving you crazy?  No.  You're driving me crazy.  We had a dream.  What happened to our dream?
Take your boots off.  You're tan.
Yeah.  We heard all about it.  I want you to know I'm deeply sorry about your girlfriend.
Yes, Barbara.  She was very pretty.
You mean the drug money?  Yes, I got it.
It's beautiful.
Don't bullshit me, George.  I don't see you very much, I don't want to waste the time.
He's going down, George.  It's election year.  We're not making any deals.
He's getting middled, too.  And Derek's our partner.  What's good for us is good for him.
What do you want me to say?  I'm in prison.  You should know.  You put me here.
Yeah.
No.  I just kind of like the sound of it.
California.
Yes, I am.
Georgie, oh man, hold the mayo!
And you believe the NLF?
The UN is far away, dear sir. It is easier to make oneself heard with bombs. If I were in their place, I would use bombs.
You weren't able to. But what's important is that you tried.
C'mon ... you're exaggerating. The orders were to shoot him in the back.
Then don't complain.
Because we aren't ready yet for the French. Before attacking, we must have safe places from which to depart and find refuge. Of course, there is the Casbah. But even the Casbah isn't safe yet. There are too many drunks, pushers, whores, addicts, spies ... people who talk too much ... people who are ready to sell themselves, undecided people. We must either convince them or eliminate them. We must think of ourselves first. We must clean out the Casbah first. Only then will we be able to deal with the French. Do you understand, Ali?
I think it'll be a success ...
For many months, I've had your photo on my desk together with a dozen or so reports on you ... And naturally, I am under the illusion that I know you somewhat. You never seemed the type, Kader, inclined to performing useless actions.
You got something on the coke?
Had to.  I also interviewed three women who were in past relationships with Marsh.  There's no evidence that he had anything but straight sex prior to meeting Miss Lawson.
That's the best part.  She gets it all -- everything.
Yes.
Like cats and dogs.
You name it -- they argued about it. Mr. Marsh tried his best to keep her happy -- but it seemed that no matter what he did it was never enough for her.
Well -- he died on a Sunday and I have the weekends off -- but they were ripping at each other with both barrels Friday afternoon.
Sex.
Aren't they all?
Your Honor, I'm trying to establish a pattern in Dr. Paley's behavior with women.
Yes.
Doctor Steven Trammel.  Cardiologist.
At a dinner party -- about eight months ago.
Yes -- several times.
We stopped seeing each other.
Well -- I realized that she wasn't interested in me.  She was just trying to get information out of me.
That's enough.
He laughed -- and basically said he would decide when it was over.
You're lying.  Marsh was wearing a cast on the tape.  It was right before he went to Chicago and met Miss Lawson.  He dumped you for her, didn't he?
What do you think I've got?  A gun? Maybe I'm gonna kill you too.  Maybe I'll blow your head off right now.
I'll have you out in a few hours.
Because, I'm your attorney.  I shouldn't be going to your house.
No -- it just doesn't look right.
What?
She's mistaken.
It isn't true.  You have to believe me.
I don't use cocaine anymore.  If she says she saw me doing it she's lying.
I don't know, Frank -- but don't you think that's something we should find out?
To celebrate how masterfully you destroyed Roston today.
Fuck him!  He tried to shatter mine.
You're too weak, Frank.  When you want something you have to do what- ever it takes to get it.  If something gets in your way you remove it.
Why?
Raymond, I'm the only criminal attorney you have.
Mr. Roston?
I'll talk to him later.
Because I go to trial in seven weeks. I've got a lot of preparing to do.
That's too bad.
Michael, you shouldn't be happy when someone else isn't feeling well.
Not even if they're a dork.  You should go by and see how he's feeling.
Why are there two deeds here?
Well, there's a problem.
Oh, don't feel sorry for me. Please. No one's forcing me to stay.
And do what? Live alone? Go back to school? Find someone else? Start a magazine for confused woman? ... What if I can't do any of those things?
Hi. I made some brown betty. I sent Floyd off to town with the boy. I said -  "Floyd, I'm going to visit my girlfriend and spend the afternoon and that's all there is to it. He said who's going to make lunch? I said I'm taking a sick day. Eat at the dinner." Isn't that hilarious?  He didn't dare raise an eyebrow -- I don't even want to tell you how late he was out last night with those good for nothings from the Sandford ranch. I am so sorry, honey, I let two days pass before I came by, but with the boy home the time just escapes me. Have you heard from Richard? How's the fair? God, it's hot.
Long.  You just got off the train and stayed without knowing anyone there?
Not at all.
Nah. I've tried. My writing's too technical, I think. Problem of being a journalist too long is you stop giving yourself permission to invent. I better just stick to making pictures.
I'm kind of obsessed by it, actually.
I don't know if obsessions have reasons. I think that's why they're obsessions.
No. I wouldn't say that. National Geographic isn't exactly the hub of artistic inspiration. They like their wild life in focus and without any personal comment. I don't mind really. I'm not artist. I'd faced that a long time ago. It's the course of being well-adjusted. I'm too normal.
No, I think I need everyone! I love people. I want to meet them all! I just think there are too many out there saying "This is mine." or "She's mine." Too many lines have been drawn. World's breaking apart because of man's weakness for some testosterone conquests over territory and power and people. He wants control over what deep down he knows he has no control over whatsoever and it scares him silly.
I embrace Mystery. I don't know what's coming. And I don't mind.
No.
Not everybody's supposed to have a family.
I told you, I love other people.
No. But I love them just the same.
That's not what you're saying. I know it's not the same. What you're saying is, it's not as good. Or it's not as normal or proper.
I'm a little sick of this American Family Ethic everyone seems to be hypnotized by in this country. I guess you think I'm just some poor displaced soul doomed to roam the earth without a self-cleaning oven and home movie.
Do you want to leave your husband?
Are you hungry?
Long day. Go to sleep.
No.
Yes. I'm fine. It's just this heat I think.
Well, what's nice about her? Tell us!
Isn't that nice? You should bring her home to meet us!
It's the only way.  It's possible your father may not be dead yet.
Just some flies.
Let's get going.  Go home, pick up what we need, then crash here.
Dad, the man has been lying to us for a hundred years.  I mean, where is my forty acres and a mule?
I don't know whether to chill you and serve with cottage cheese, or rip you open and eat you right here.
How did you get in here?
No we won't, Momma.  I'll just have them call and tell Patrick it's us.
My old man calls the shots.  He built that gate and these damn walls.
Like you always said, Pop, look for the undervalued.
You cut him, or I shoot you.  Make your choice.
Whattaya think?  Can you picture it? Over there the bar, and in here -- the dance floor.
I was born near here.  But after my mother died, my dad moved.  I grew up out in Rossmore Park.
You want to get into this now?
Ask Johnnie!  Ask your rat-fuck son!
That's none of your goddamn business, Caesar.
I was getting out of the car when I saw him in the Mercedes.
It was him.  I'm positive.
Caesar, I know Johnnie.  It was him. I screamed when I saw him.  I couldn't believe I missed them.  I knew you were going to be upset so I thought I'd apologize and give Gino the Scotch.  I honked a couple of times but he didn't stop.
For Christ's sake, Johnnie, do what he says.
Everything you couldn't.
Pretty good, sir.
No.
Yeah.
How do I know you are cops?
No, but Caesar does.  He likes him. Says he's a good Italian.
Oh no, no.  I'm not the marrying kind.
Why?
I think so, too.
Do you think you know me like that?
The plane is in at seven, so I'd say about eight.
Gino travels with a big man named Roy.  Caesar calls him the driver.
If he runs, everyone will assume he took the money.
Pop?
You'd want to make that go away. You'd want to remind them that Treadstone is a training organization.  That it's all theoretical.  You'd want to sign off on that.
Then I'd have to explain Treadstone. And you'd have to explain how you let me get this far.  Doesn't sound like much of a Plan-B, does it?  We'll clean up the field.  You clean up your budgets.
Am I Treadstone?  Me?  What the hell're you talking about?
Thanks.
I don't want to go alone.  I want you to drive me to Paris.  Like we're a couple.  Like we're a couple and we're travelling together.  That's all we're doing.
I won't hurt you.
Then I'll find another ride.
I guess.
Marie -- look at me -- there's no time for this --
-- we can't stay here -- I can't stay here -- it's not safe here --
-- we can go -- I can get us out of here -- but we have to go now --
No.
You're wrong.  I didn't know.
I didn't know this would happen.
And where is he now?  You believe what you want, but I'm telling you the truth -- I never would have brought you here if I thought it was dangerous.
You stay -- if you want, you stay -- it's okay -- it's better -- maybe it's better -- I don't know --  But I can't stay here.  <u>I can't</u>.
-- there's no time --
-- how? --
-- forget it --
I don't know what happened!  I don't know who he is!  I don't know what he wants!  I don't even know who I am!  The only thing I know is that if I stay here, I'm never gonna find out!
xxxxxx
My husband's out looking for him.
That old beast?  Miss his breakfast? Not a chance.  It's always something, right?
Zurich police are looking for an American with a red bag.  Apparently he put two cops in the hospital last night.
Uh - what? - I ...
...Yer nostril?
...sabotage!
David ... in a free society information is the name of the game. You can't win the game if you're a man short.
I assure you, Sam, I'm doing everything within my power. But the rules of the game are laid down, and we all have to play by them - even me.
Yes, well, from the Department's point of view you're certainly a bit of an own goal, but ...
Sam, if you've been going out there and playing a straight bat, all the way down the line, you've got absolutely nothing to worry about.
Sam, I think I ought to tell you ... I'm afraid she's upped stumps and retired to the pavilion.
You didn't know as much about this business as you pretended to, did you?
Very smart.
Yes. I'm impressed.
She witnessed the Tuttle arrest - the Buttle arrest - and since then she's been making wild allegations, obviously trying to exploit the situation - she's working for somebody, and she's not working for us.
If you say so.
Ah.
Oh.
What does it look like ... I'm collecting empties.
Yes.
Your face ... are you hurt?
27156789/074328/K.
A woman eh? I see.
This is your dream girl, is it?
You must be joking -  When there's a woman involved - there's no stopping me. Now, let me have that sheet.
What is it?
What? Now? It's my lunch hour.
Thirtieth floor, sir. You're expected.
No, sir.
No need, sir
No you couldn't, sir. This is Information Retrieval.  the lift's arrived, sir.
Emergency procedures.
No. Wait here.
He looks like a cop.
I can't hold up my head anymore.
What did you say?
It's okay. They're prescription.  Works better with a little whiskey.
I'm all right. I just can't stand to see people tied up.  I'm in the waiting room for hours, listening to Noel screaming. The only reason he's screaming is 'cause he's tied up.
Don't say that. I wanted to cut my father loose too. They told me he almost died and five minutes later they say he's better and I go in. It's killing me seeing him fighting like that.  Look, since you're here, maybe you could do me a favor. I need you to wait for me outside this building, okay? I have to visit a friend who's sick.
Is it true that you and Love went on a blind date?  She hit you with a bottle?
What look?
We just saved a little baby boy. Think of it that way.
How can that be? He was getting better.
He was tough. You did all you could.
You have to keep the body going until the brain and heart recover enough to go on their own.
Better bring it all.
What?
I'm not hungry.
I eat. I just haven't had coffee yet.
You really think so?
You write this?
I'm starting to... We may do the capitols of the states.
Yes.  And I'm sorry that they're sending you down for a while, but you'll make it back...Where they sending you?
London.  That's a promotion!
It is.  Yes -- that's where they had Rorish, for God's sake, before they made him anchor.  I can't stand it -- they're grooming you for it all and you don't even know it.
Can I ask you something?  You only had one crew on the date rape piece, right?
At six o'clock on the wake-up news they used the wrong missile graphic.
A half hour in the lobby.
Thanks.  The F-14 is one of the most difficult planes to master.  Oh, you call them 'Tomcats' and in the 70's the first crop had a number of crashes.
You didn't see it or speak to anybody?
Then it went well.
Define your terms.
No.
No.
I lost six pounds...
It was great...writing my little first rate copy, sitting on my jacket, punching my one thought. But I had this historic attack of flop sweat so they'll never let me another again.  Oh, I lost one of your shoulder pads -- how was your evening anyway?
People phoned in.
I'm not kidding.
No, nice ones worried that I was having a heart attack.
I don't know.  At a certain point it was so off the chart bad -- it got funny.  My central nervous system was telling me something. Jane -- sweat running down my face -- makeup falling into my eyes -- people turning this fusillade of blow dryers on me -- all so I could read introductions to other people who were covering stories which is what I like to do anyway.  And I'm chipper because you finally showed up.  I thought I'd cook for us. Tequila and eggs sound good?
Stop.  Ernie thought I was good too -- he couldn't help.  My agent has a hot prospect -- the number two station in Portland.  The general manager says he wants to be every bit as good as the networks.  Personally, I think he should aim higher.
Ernie told this story.  How he used to write obits and when the people in town called him up with death notices, he cried.  He was till that way when they promoted him out of obits.  He says you're lucky if you can get out while you could still cry.  I should have quit this place  three years ago.
You didn't say anything to her?
Move away from me.
Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuckes.  Snot... Fuckee.  You want to use that?
Well, you always want to give the credit away, do you?
I'll speak to you soon
We could...
Okay.
Proud?  I'm just embarrassed that I like when they say those things.
It's not.
That actually goes on...
Yes, sure.
And it has nothing to do with the fact I left your room instead of staying there?
I'm going over to Aaron's.  Maybe I'll hoop up with all of you later.  How long do you think you'll be there?
Who?
Where are you?
Well, when?
I know.  I taped it.
Not if you count 'Singing in the Rain.'  Do him a favor and don't treat it like a tragedy.  You want me to talk to him?
Well, let's do a special report on that...I mean that's news.
What I don't know, I can learn and what I know, nobody can teach. Excuse me for saying it about myself, but I think it's true.  What do you think?  Never mind what you think.
Through the closet.
Yes.  Fifty dollars an hour, right?
Anything new?
Is the manager cooperating?
Alright I got you, man.  It's my turn for freak patrol.
It wasn't easy.
Yes Walter.
Oh...f-for a long time.  Ever since you first came to the club.
I'm honored to know this man.
Nothing...nothing at all.
Don't ask.
I think he's looking for you, man... it's all finally catching up with you!
What is it, your laundry?
Well...
I don't have another cat!
A parakeet?
These things take time Walter... but for now you've got to break out of this one...avenue you're on...
Uh, hi.
NO! NO DON'T SHOOT ME I DON'T WANT TO GET SHOT!
Here here!
Gee.  Thanks.
Not as single-minded as the others, not as sybaritic.  Almost thoughtful. She's useless.
He's got a...  What do you call it? A Napoleonic Code.
Bummer metaphor.
Probably.  What movie is this?
It's the news, Buffy.
I just want to see the basketball scores.  It's important.
Oh, come on, Buffy.  You know what's going on.  It's not working out at all.  I've got to move on.  I mean, I've got needs, too.  I told you about all this.
Didn't you get my message?
You weren't home.  Like always.
I'm out of here.  Jenny.
Not exactly.
Yeah.
What for?
I don't believe this.  The world's under attack by the legions of the undead and you're going to a mixer?
You got that right.  I thought you wanted to kill vampires.
Listen, I know you're bummed about your friend, and I'm really sorry...
But, Buffy, you're the guy, the chosen guy.
I should have known.
Okay, guys, how about the ozone layer?
Buffy, I'm gonna tell Jeffrey you were playing with another man's Hebrew National.
In Virginia.
China.
Our purposes.
Try to pay attention.
And where are they now?
Cassandra's really smart.
I guess.
Really?
I heard she got straight A's.
Does Jeffrey know?
Seriously, Buffy.  That look was way twisted.  What were you thinking about?
You see how nice things are when we go slow?
It's all the same thing.
I did.
He said if I gave in to you I'd start losing again.
I'll be back when we lose.
Well, he fucks like he pitches. Sorta all over the place
Yep.
When you're hitting you shouldn't think about anything but hitting.  But you shouldn't think about it too much.  The trick is to use your brain to not use your brain.
So...Wanta make love?
You okay?
He looks great, just great!
You got a live arm there.
C'mon, God damn it, gimme some!
'Cause you don't respect yourself, which is your problem, but you don't respect the game--and that's my problem.  You got a gift.
A gift.  When you were a baby the gods reached down and turned your left arm into a thunderbolt.
I want you to throw this one at the bat rack.
It'll keep the fear of God in the hitters.  Trust me.
Let go of me!
The Crash Davis. ) And you, Larry Hockett, should recognize me 'cause five years ago in the Texas League when you were pitching for El Paso and I was hitting cleanup for Shreveport, you hung a curve on an 0-2 pitch of a 3-2 game in bottom of the 8th and I tattooed it over the Goodyear Tire sign, beat you 4-3-- and I got a free wheel alignment from Goodyear.
I was thinking I could fly up and spend a week in the Big Leagues with you--help you get comfortable.
We'll be praying for you.
We'll pray anyway.
Eight and twenty-four!  How'd we ever win 8 games?
Look, guys--I'm a man, I got needs too.  I understand this party-- but...  sex is the one thing you can get further behind in and catch up faster than anything I know.  There's a baseball lesson in there somewhere.  Where's Crash?
But you can't just fire him. Webb's his brother-in-law. He's County Commissioner.
This is his state. His uncle's Chief Judge. His brother-in-law runs the County Commission. I don't know how many other relatives he's got in town.  There's gotta be a way to work him back in.
This is a very auspicious occasion.
Philip, if you would rise.
All right, take care.
So, once she signs those papers, she'll be the only person to have total access to the box?  No one else, including myself?
You know, I don't know if I could do this even if I wanted to. The Gaming Commission would never give me a license. I have at least two dozen gambling and bookmaking pinches on me.
Honey, come here.
No.
Here, let's put a little of this on for you. I know you like this. A little butter, right, not a lot?
Meet me at three.
No, a...
Why?
Yeah, I heard a lot about you.
...as soon as Andy got back home, Nicky heard about our talk in the car.
Next morning bright and early, I get the call.
I don't care what she is. She's an institution, that's the problem. She's lazy.
Hey, Mitch.
Thank you.
Need a little help with that, Mr Collins?
Okay.
Okay, okay.
I don't need one.
That's all you care about.  You don't care about me at all.
No, you don't.
Oh, God. Oh, God. Okay.  Okay... I'll try. I'll try.
Come with me now! Come with me now. Come with me now. I want you out of here.
So, who'd you go to lunch with?
And where'd you go?
What'd you have?
What did Jennifer have?
Okay. I want you to call Jennifer and I want you to tell her to tell you what she had for lunch, and I'm gonna listen in on the other line.
You know why I want to do it. Just do it.
Mm.
Not gonna let me in?
What do you mean, what am I gonna do? I'm in the same clothes for two days! I want to get a few of my things! Big deal!
Mr Rothstein.
What?
Yeah, that's my pen. Why?
Well, thank you. Why don't you take that fuckin' pen and shove it up you ass, you fuckin' jag-off?
But how much cash could I bury in my closet, right?
Oh, listen, I understand that there's always a risk... you know, I might have to take a loss somewhere.
I mean, you will try to push it through, won't you, Mr Clark?
Well, you gotta understand, I'm giving you fifty thousand cash.
Pitch-black?! It -
You - You fuckin' moron, I'll be filling out paper work for the next two months because of you and this piece of shit, you...
...fuckin' jerk-off.
Nicky, I'm sorry.
Oh.
Ma che cazzo!
Well, I guess it's 'cause he loves you so much. He's jealous and worried.
Look, I'll try to find out what the hell's goin' on. When I see him I'll talk to him.
All right?
Come on, come on, you're a toughie. You can take this.  Don't cry.
Yes, you are.
Come on. Don't be scared.
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.  Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
Okay, then.
Uh, talk to you later.  Bye. 
Hey. Hey, Sammy, how are you?
What, are you gonna have a fuckin' meeting here, or are you gonna buy some diamonds?
It's up to you.
Take it easy. What could you do? I mean, she threw herself at you, right?
Oh, sorry -
Receipts and bills and... everything's here.
I'm sorry.
Nance gives me trouble and I'll tell him... screw around with those suitcases and I'll take the eyes out of his frickin' head.
I didn't curse. I said 'frickin' head'.
I'm sorry.
It's okay. Let her go.
I wonder..
You're telling the truth. I can tell..How did this..
Yes, did you call us here for any particular reason?
I've been thinking. I've been thinking about us. I'm sorry I've been so hard no you these past couple days. I realize now it's because you're the only woman who ever understood me and I couldn't handle it!  I've never revealed myself to anyone the way I have to you. Let's blow this town together.  We'll run a bed-and-breakfast in Vermont by day, and by night, we'll dress up and kill anything that...
You were right all along--the two parts to a person are the reality and the lie.  I was making good money as a top architect--but that's not who I am. I'm not an architect, I'm a..
I don't know what I was saying. I totally phoned it in last night. I haven't been getting a lot of sleep lately...
Just a homeless woman. Wrong place.
You can't get away with..
"Pre-bicentennial babe?"
What?
About the same. Thanks for asking...Damn blender.  Okay, I can't stand it anymore, I'm dying to know--Did you try on some whiskers last night and hit a 7-11 along with all those other women? You had to have thought about it--a Catwoman for a night?
I'm having a hard time picking up your signal this morning--What did you say?
I was doing my job. At the risk of sounding egotistical, I didn't become the best reporter in the world sitting by the phone. I was chasing tail all night--I was not spying, intentionally, on your hot and heavy date with "Brock Leviathan, architect."  I can't believe he ordered white wine.  You do know white wine is not real wine...
Oh, I forgot to tell you, you're on a diet...The fact you're still reasonably pretty is the one thing you got going for you.
Is every single thing out of your mouth since your "accident" have to be a monotone mumble of cheap sarcasm?
It's funny, I've heard of giving up finding a man and raising a family to pursue a career. And I've heard of foregoing a career to start a family-- but I think you're onto something new, Selina. "Absolutely nothing"-- Has a ring to it. I think it could catch on...How's that for sarcasm?
Thanks.
Me, he won't stay on the phone with for five fucking minutes without bitching.
He's at it again.  Like that night at the Emerald.  This piece of Euro-trash is slapping shit out of his little wife in a back booth -- so Mr. Good Deed here has got to step in and pound the fucker's head into the wall.  Meantime "Wifey" recovers enough to pull off her high heel and nearly take our hero's eye out.  It took six stitches.
You got it wrong.  I'm the one that's on your side.
So Theo and Nels will appear to have whacked each other out and we never existed.  A thing of beauty. Jesus, the shit you come up with!
I'm doing fine.  Theo wants to deal.
I'm in traffic.  There's no place to turn.
Shit!
How much time do you have left on it?
Why didn't you do what your friends wanted and just -- get rid of me?
A woman?
I didn't mean to open up any old wounds.
And that was the end of it?
I'm sorry if I caused you to lose your business deal.
The one in Brentwood.
The City National on San Vincente.
Shit.  I'm sorry.
You could've hit me.
You wouldn't --
Stop talking like that!
The cop in the trunk -- he could still be alive.
He might've heard everything we said in the car.
We can't leave him to repeat anything.
You're the man with the gun.
Naturally.
Only one way to find out.
I don't want it.
Sure, like I'm gonna take advice from you.
Then just wait.  I'm counting this all out and deducting my share. While I'm at it you can be getting that tape off the lady.  And her little girl.
I make my end of the cash at 184,000.  Now I'm trying to figure out the bonds.  What the face value is.
I'm not accepting criticism today. Now don't make me lose count. There's already a half million in this portfolio.
My pleasure --
Thanks for the sound advice.  Now ask the woman to get out of the van and walk over here.  Alone.
You'll still have the girl and the husband.
Soon as Mrs. Oberfeld is in my car I'll toss out your first third. Then I'll back up 200 feet to behind the public restroom.
You pull up -- collect your first installment.  Then you let the daughter go.  When she reaches me, I'll dump out another third.  Same action.  I back up again -- you pull forward.  Satisfy yourself it's there.  Then we do it one last time.  The final exchange. And we go our separate ways.
I won't let 'em.
There's two police cars now.
You want us to get ourselves killed?
And I end up in a fucking neck brace for life!
Following which we will have a serious question and answer session with your girlfriend.
Yeah.
What do you think his name is?
Cunt.
She's not a tart.
She's not that either.
Scottish?
The accent, I suppose.
Like treacle.
No, I didn't --
Jesus fucking Christ.
Is this an obsession of yours?
He did sometimes.
Where?
Sorry.
Probably.
You can always pretend.
Absolutely.
Are you pretending yet?
Why shouldn't I be jealous?
Sorry. What you doing?
Only in times of extreme stress.
Stop it, Dil --
I asked you a question, honey -- were you there too --
You're back in the pink, Tommy? How're you keeping?
He ran. I couldn't shoot him in the back. I tried to catch him. He made it to the road and got hit by a Saracen.
Yes.
No, what is the thing?
What do you mean?
No way, Jude. I'm out.
Do you want a cup of tea?
I understand.
Can't we take it off?
How different?
Don't be so sure.
Tell me something, anything.
Who gives a fuck.
You're crazy --
Well -- come on.
Can you remember anything at all?
With whom? Where?
Think, Reggie, you've got to think -- it may be what we're looking for.
Nonsense. We didn't steal it. There's no law against stealing stolen money.
There is? Well, I can't say I think very much of a silly law like that. Think, Reggie -- please think -- what was written in Charles' notebook?
Here, give it to me.
Wait a minute -- you think those three men killed Charles, don't you?
Well, there you are! Charles had the money with him -- so whoever killed him has it -- they have it!
Mrs. Lampert? -- Bartholomew. I've spoken to Washington, Mrs. Lampert --
I told them what you said -- about this man being Carson Dyle's brother. I asked them what they knew about it and they told me -- you're not gonna like this, Mrs. Lampert -- they told me Carson Dyle has no brother.
I said with the mouth shut.
I'll take that.
Whoever it is won't give up -- and neither will I.
What makes you think that this somebody will be satisfied with three? He wants it all, Alex -- that means we're in his way, too.
First your brother, then Charles, now Scobie -- we've got to do something! Any minute now we could be assassinated! Would you do anything like that?
No --
I can't very well leave without a pair of water wings.
Fiction or non-fiction?
Well!
Go on.
I suppose all this is leading somewhere?
What do you mean?
You mean, you're a thief?
I don't believe it.
But I do believe it -- that's what I don't believe. So it's goodbye Alexander Dyle -- Welcome home Peter Joshua.
Adam Canfield. Wonderful. Do you realize you've had three names in the past two days? I don't even know who I'm talking to any more.
No -- he's not the same. Alexander Dyle was interested in clearing up his brother's death. Adam Canfield is a crook. And with all the advantages you've got -- brains, charm, education, a handsome face --
The kid said --
Is that all? Can I go now?
A man traded with me -- all those for only four.
Starting tonight?
There are three men -- he's one of them -- they think I have something that belongs to them.
A quarter of a million dollars.
Don't make too much noise, Miz Lampert --
I've never seen him before.
How can you tell?
I'm Lisa Sherman. Dylan's aunt. He asked me to come talk to you.
He feels terrible about those things he said to you in school.
I think I know how to restore your reputation.
Can I come in? I'll need to use the phone.
The kids adore him. They confide in him. His patchouli reeking rear might know if Stacy and Rod were really virgins. Why didn't you ask Jody that?
So?
Why not? You worried you might find out how much she actually knows?
Are you sure?
This will relax her.
What?
I'm sure you should have failed.
Who?
Why?
I don't watch him eat everyday.
The phone just went dead. I called the police and ran right over as fast as I could.
I'm not using him as an excuse.
I do not.
I have to go home after school. I have something really important I have to ask my mom.
I'll think about it.
Quick! In the house. He won't look for us in there.
Not a day has gone by where your father has not torn himself to shreds for what happened. We both have...
So are you.
You're the one who's hand is shaking.
INT. ICE CREAM TRUCK/CAB - DAWN.
...that is going to explode...
INT. GOMEZ'S HELICOPTER - DAY.
Oh, man.
Okay.

...gun?!
Kiss my ass!
Taking it down the hill.

Then stay...
Oh, shit.  Okay.  Come on.
Bring him down!

Go, go, go! 
I'm gonna kill him.
Arlo, I'm gonna get Elvis.  You go.
Okay.  Come on, big guy!
...within five minutes.
Mason, you have to take this...
Wait.  This town is full of trucks.  Nice new trucks.  You don't need to go...
We do need your truck.

Forget about him.
INT. BRYNNER'S VAN - NIGHT.
INT. BRYNNER'S VAN - DAY.
You can't fire on them.  You're gonna detonate the crystals.
I got someone who's anxious to talk to you, Mr. Mason.
Goddamn it, Ma-...
...and then my night man shows up when he feels like...
Darlene, it's five-thirty.  Now, I worked late for you this mornin', and you didn't wanna spring for over-...
Oh.  Well, I have got to get to the dentist be-...
I can handle it.
INT. VITELLI'S HELICOPTER - DAY.
Uh-huh.
I will tell you what I...
 The only one who understands what this me-...
Doctor.
Mason, you wouldn't know the truth if it bit you.  We've got your whole record.  We know about the-the conviction for vagrancy...
I didn't sell the boy any...
Shut your mouth until I tell you...
You know, I gotta tell you.  That really bothers me, somebody calls me "son."


INT. TUNNEL - DAY.
That's right.
If that's what it says.
Sir, this is not a lending library, it's the Hall of Records.
A ruler?
Well, It was about five days ago. You were outside the Pig 'n Whistle and you had one hell of an argument.
You know, you're okay, Mr. Gittes. I know it's your job, but you're okay.
Thanks. You know something, Jake?
I think I'll kill her.
Okay.
I said okay, Jake.
No.
No.
C'mon I'll show you.
But there is no possibility he would have taken his own life?
Mrs. Mulwray, do you happen to know the name of the young woman in question?
What do you mean?
You may if you can, Mr. Gittes.
Suppose they did. How does it concern you?
It's very personal. It couldn't be more personal. Is this a business or an obsession with you?
She's cheating on him.
Yes, of course. It was quite a while after. I was just out of grade school when they did that.
What were you doing there?
Doing what?
You won't go to the police if I tell you?
She's my sister and my daughter!
Jesus, that's in Chinatown, ain't it?
Oh, good.
I don't think so. Be happy to show you.
Just, if you will, confine yourself to the main building. It's nearly bedtime.
Si.
I'm afraid so.
They got into a terrific argument outside the Pig 'n Whistle.
I don't know. The traffic was pretty loud. I only heard one thing  apple core.
Yeah.
I'm going to see a man called Julian Cross. Ever heard of him?
I'm working for his daughter.
She ain't exactly long in the tooth now.
You must be thinking of a different daughter.
She ran away?
Then why don't you want to teach it to me too? Now that there's no more cranking, and it's easier?
Then why don't you change jobs? 
No...
But don't you like anything about what you do? 
Alfredo, go fuck yourself!!! 
What's she like? What's she like?...
Whatever you do, love it like you loved that projection booth of the Paradiso when you were little... 
I got back today. You can't imagine the excuses I had to make up to be here...
I'll never agree with you. Never, Elena.
Well, it's hard to call an important person by his first name. But if it really matters to you, I'11 call you...  Toto!...
I ordered six already this morning! Got a discount!
Sit down, everybody - for heaven's sake!
It's three hours and fifty minutes late - but we did it -

Because we're running a newspaper, Mr. Kane, not a scandal sheet.
I'm protecting myself every way I know how, Mrs. Kane.  This last week, I finally found out how I can stop your husband from being elected. If the people of this state learn what I found out this week, he wouldn't have a chance to - he couldn't be elected Dog Catcher.  Well, what I'm interested in is seeing that he's not elected.  I don't care whether they know what I know about him.  Let him keep right on being the Great, Noble, Moral -  Champeen of the people.  Just as long as -
Emily - you musn't leave me now - you can't do that to me.
Charlie, he said, unless you withdrew your name -
I can't stay here all night chasing your pain away.
Susan, it seems to me -
I'm not sorry.
No, you're not.
Your job isn't to give Mrs. Kane your opinion of her talents. You're supposed to train her voice. Nothing more.
If you're interested in what people say, Signor Matisti, I may be able to enlighten you a bit.  The newspapers, for instance.  I'm an authority on what the papers will say, Signor Matisti, because I own eight of them between here and San Francisco...  It's all right, dear. Signor Matisti is going to listen to reason.  Aren't you, maestro? 
You can't.
Marie has been packing since morning, Mr. Kane.
It's a good idea for a newspaper.  Four hundred sixy thousand.
Why, Brad?
What do you mean by that?
It's a letter from her lawyers.
Rawlston is my boss.
He knows the first Mrs. Kane socially -  That's the answer we got.
Ask the question anyway, Thompson! Build the picture around the question, even if you can't answer it.
All we saw on that screen was a big American -
I had a toothache.
It's never too late. Give those cigarettes back now, and buy some gum instead.  Here. Chewlies Gum. Try this.
It's cheaper than cigarettes. And it certainly beats this.
Ladies and gentleman, Mrs. Asian Design Major herself: Caitlin Bree!
I take it she likes the guy.
Children's programming. What did your mom say when you told her you weren't engaged anymore?
Wow, you got thrown out? For Dante?
Can I watch?
Can I join in?
Few are. So what makes you think you can maintain a relationship with Dante this time around?
Wow. Hey, I was just about to order some dinner. You eat Chinese, right?
Exactly.
He went home to change for the big date.
No, this is great.
There's no light back there.
Well, there are, but for some reason they stop working at five-fourteen every night.
Nobody can figure it out. And the boss doesn't want to pay the electrician to fix it, because the electrician owes money to the video store.
And I'm caught in the middle-torn between my loyalty for the boss, and my desire to piss with the light on.
Like what?
Um... okay.
I can't say for certain until we get him back to the lab, but my guess is he was masturbating, his heart seized and he died. That's when the girl found him.  Something smells like shoe polish.
"Space Alien Revealed as Head of Time Warner; Reports Stock Increase."  They print any kind of shit in these papers.
Peptic ulcer.
No, thanks.
Why?
What kind of show?
Can we talk about this later?
I don't know. You going to lock the video store?
We're not playing in the street.
I'm telling you, it wasn't my fault!
I was just leaning on it! It was an accident!
So the casket fell over! Big deal!
So they'll put her back in! It's not like it's gonna matter if she breaks something!
Bunch of savages in this town.  Hey, Caitlin's in the back. You might want to see if she's okay; she's been back there a long time.
I told her that. She said she didn't need any. Why don't you join her, man. Make a little bathroom bam-bam.
Fuck you.
Oh please! I'm surprised I didn't kill you.
Why do I say that?  Randal... forget it.
What don't you do?  Randal, sometimes it seems like the only reason you come to work is to make my life miserable.
What time did you get to work today?
You were over half an hour late. Then all you do is come over here.
Which means the video store is ostensibly closed.
Unless you're out renting videos at other video stores.
You get my slapped with a fine, you fight with the customers and I have to patch everything up. You get us chased out of a funeral by violating a corpse. To top it all off, you ruin my relationship. What's your encore? Do you anally rape my mother while pouring sugar in my gas tank?  You know what the real tragedy is? I'm not even supposed to be here today!
Excuse me?
I didn't strain. I sighed.
I don't think so.
They are not.
What are you talking about? There's no fat on this body.
Done poisoning the youth for the day?
One seventy-nine.
A half hour.
I should start.
With you? I don't think so.
Nothing personal.
Like three dollars in mixed change and a couple of singles. People only get the paper of coffee this time of morning.
Why do you say that?
Theoretically, people see money on the counter and nobody around, they think they're being watched.
I had to use shoe polish to make that sign. The smell won't come off.
Why? You wanna have sex or something?
Really?
Yeah, right. You can't get enough of me.
How do you figure?
Women? Women, as lovers, are all basically the same: they just have to be there.
Making a male climax is not all that challenging: insert somewhere close and preferably moist; thrust; repeat.
Now, making a woman cum... therein lies a challenge.
A girl makes a guy cum, it's standard. A guy makes a girl cum, it's talent.
Something wrong?
I touched a nerve.
It wasn't directed at you. I was making a broad generalization.
These are my opinions based on my experiences with the few women who were good enough to sleep with me.
How many what?
How many different girls? Didn't we already have this discussion once?
Including you?
Twelve.
Including you; yes.
If you didn't want to go out with me anymore, why didn't you just say it? Instead, you pussyfoot around and see that slut behind my back!
You've been talking to her on the phone for weeks!
And then you pull that shit this morning, freaking out because I've gone down on a couple guys!
I'm not the one trying to patch things up with my ex, sneaking around behind your back! And if you think that thirty-seven dicks are a lot, then just wait, mister: I'm going to put the hookers in Times Square to shame with all the guys I go down on now!
Explain what? How you were waiting until the time was right, and then you were going to dump me for her?
Scumbag. What are you doing?
He's your cousin?
No way.
I don't know. I can't really tell from here.
I find it's best to stay out of other people's affairs.
No way, death-breath, that was too intense for thunder.  C'mon let's rock an' roll.
Where's the radio?
Hey, anything for a friend. How's the knee?
Funny, he told me he twisted it gettin' out of a hot tub.
Rescue One -- have located helpless climber, please prepare <u>idiot line</u> for transport, over.
Not on that leg.
You keep it.  Get up there if you can, and if you get a chance, do me a favor and kill him.
Help me!  I don't want to die!
He doesn't want my help.
He can handle it.
I haven't climbed in months--you lose the feel.
I don't know.  Here, lay down and get some rest.  We're going to need it.
We gotta get out and fire a flare.  It's the only chance!
Hand-holds?!  I can barely see them.
Are you crazy?  Has the altitude shrunk your brain, Gabe?
I won't do it.  No way.
Enough's enough.  How could anybody in their right mind... then again, you never were in your right mind.
I'm going to wrap it around your throat!
Forget it!  I refuse!
Don't lay any guilt on me. Suicide's a personal thing, best done alone.
The only faster way up is the East Face and it's smooth as glass.  Maybe a dozen guys in the world could do it in good weather, only a psycho would try it in a storm.
Anyone else following?
<u>Negative</u>.  The winds are too high.  I'm going to ride out the storm here.  I'll take shelter in the Douglas Exhibition Shaft. Over and out.
Ask the questions.
You dumb bastard, you waited too long.  If he made it back, this place would have been covered with police in a few hours.  The way we're moving, it's going to be anyway.
Lets get things nice and sparkling clear. This sarcasm, if I may call it such, does not become you, O my brothers. As I am your droog and leader, I am entitled to know what goes on, eh? Now then, Dim, what does that great big horsy gape of a grin portend?
I understand that you had a rather unfortunate encounter with the Police tonight.
Hahaha, and how are you feeling now?
Feel like talking to us. Answering a few questions?
Well, as I've said, we've heard about you. We are interested in your case. We want to help you.
But first we'd like to find out a few things about you.
Well, shall we get down to it?
Come, come, come, Georgie Boy. You're a big strong chelloveck like us all. We're not little children, are we, Georgie Boy? What, then, didst thou in thy mind have? Confrontation. Georgie backs down.
Tell me more, Georgie Boy.
Why do you say that, brother? I had a shower this morning.
No, brother. What d'you want?
Sorry, brother. I didn't mean any offence.
Why did you do that, brother? I've never done wrong to you.
... and this... He pulls Alex's nose.
... because I don't like you horrible type, do I, and if you want to start something... if you want to start... go on... well, you just start. Please do. Alex retching.
You're gonna be sick are you?
You wanna be sick?
You wanna get up? Well, you've gotta you see... well I want you to lick it. Go on... Lick it. Alex, gagging and coughing, licks the sole of his shoe.
And, O my brothers, would you believe your faithful friend and long suffering narrator pushed out his red yahzik a mile and a half to lick the grahzny, vonny boots. The horrible killing sickness had wooshed up and turned the like joy of battle into a feeling I was going to snuff it. Minister rises.
Good Morning, Missus. Lovely day, isn't it?
How're you feeling this morning?
Good. In a few minutes, you'll meeting Dr. Brodsky and we'll begin your treatment. You're a very lucky boy to have been chosen.
We're going to friends now, sir.
What's the hypo for then? Going to send me to sleep?
Vitamins will it be then?
What exactly is the treatment here going to be then?
You mean like going to the pictures?
Well, that's good. I like to viddy the old films now and again.
Fine, my boy, fine, fine.
You have, my son.
Indeed.
You certainly have not, 655321. You've been very helpful, and you've shown a genuine desire to reform.
Certainly, my son, certainly. Is there something troubling you, my son? Don't be shy to speak up. Remember, I know all the urges that can trouble young men deprived of the society of women.
Where did you hear about this? Whose been talking about these things?
I take it you are referring to the Ludovico Technique?
That's not proven, 655321. In fact, it is only in the experimental stage at this moment.
It has not been used yet in this prison. The Governor has grave doubts about it and I have heard that there are very serious dangers involved.
The question is weather or not this technique really makes a man good. Goodness comes from within. Goodness is chosen. When a man cannot chose, he ceases to be a man.
Be patient, my son, and put your trust in the Lord.
Amen. They cross themselves.
And there's Will the English in the Muscleman coffee mesto saying he can fence anything that anything that any malchick tries to crast.
The shiny stuff. The Ice. The big, big, big money is available's what Will the English says.
Thank you.
Yes, you could.  I think you need it more than I do.  It'll help.  I promise.
You're kidding me.
Jesus...
Was it great?  Better than great, it had to be...
You heard Armstrong play live.  I've never been this jealous.  You get to talk to him?
I think...
I don't know...
And you came all the way down here to see me?
Tell my son.  You have to hold a gun to his head to get him to come see me.
I'll fuck you up, you don't hand it over.
Where you been the last two hours? Your mother's been calling every ten minutes whining about how you didn't show up.
You always stutter?
It's not me.
I Ching?  You threw a man out a window!
What'd he do to you?
How can you kill him like that?
Who was he?
Rwanda-Burundi.  Central Africa.
Tell him next time he pulls any shit, you're gonna kick his fat ass.
Tell her I can't see her tonight, okay?
Why?
Fifteen years, although I prefer the term "assassin."
No.
You tell me to start a union, I'm blowing your head off.  Quit stalling and get out of the cab.
Let her go.
Water mains usually go in the winter.  It's August 1st.
Mississippi?
You know, Flip, Vietnam War was fought because of a bet Howard Hughes lost to Aristotle Onasis.
I gotta go, Flip.  Thanks.
You bit someone's nose off?
Don't tell me you're naked back there.
You're certifiable.
Believe you about what?
Uh huh.
Never, but I've been practicing.
Just a guy trying to put out a fire.
Holes?  I don't know what you're talking about.
Now's not really the time to get into this --
You go.  Send me a postcard.
You saw me standing alone ...
Now she tells me.
You already asked me that.  Why do you insist on making me repeat myself?
You've asked me that one three times.
I'm sorry.  What was the question again?
Honestly?  I think he has a crush on me.
Excuse me?
A year ago I was leaving work late one night.  Two guys tried to mug me.  It was horrible.  Jerry came out of nowhere.  To my rescue. Then he started coming to see me.  Could've been a storybook if he wasn't crazy.  At first I did my beat to avoid him.  But there's something inside Jerry and...  Jerry made me see it.  <u>He made me</u> <u>see him</u>.  That make sense?
You do recognize it then?
I know the story.  A federal judge.  He denied a man in prison an appeal for a new trial.
Walters had nothing to do with your father's murder.
This doesn't make sense.
I don't like it.  Something's wrong.
We don't know who Jonas is.  We don't know who it is we're cooperating with.
-- Understood.
Yeah, I do.
What do you mean?
Michael Kitz, National Security Advisor.
If it's attention you want I'd say you've got it.  Just one thing:  Why Vega? Everyone's looked at Vega for years with no results, and now, yesterday, they start broadcasting primes. Why?
... I can't believe they wouldn't take something as basic as our biological needs into account...
In ancient times when parchment was in short supply people would write over old writing... it was called a palimpsest.
Thank you, Mr. Sensitive.  I'm coming at this wrong... missing something... something...
Is it possible.  Yes.  But --
-- but I don't believe it to be the truth.
Can you help us?
It's so... small.
Keep it down, okay?  Drumlin thinks I'm enough of a flake as it is.  Look -- everyone here has their little fetishes.  Caven goes to topless bars, Vernon's got his carnivorous plants... mine just happens to be extraterrestrial intelligence.
And where exactly does that put your position...?
Really.
What'd you think?
I won't deny I was ambitious.  When I had my... experience... I wanted to tell my story to as many people as possible.  I'm the first to admit that process included making some compromises.  You didn't answer my question.
I don't consider you the enemy, Ellie.  I'm not 'out to get' technology.  I only ask the question:  Does it have to have all the answers?  I look out there and I see so much emptiness... People are so starved for meaning, and it's something they just don't seem to be getting from science.
I don't follow.
Hi.
It was quite a page turner.
It wasn't his fault. Nobody said anything about seats. We --
Here, Mom.
Nothin'. Ever'thing's cool's can be.
Tried to live always just as free and aboveboard as you been, and well, they ain't that much elbow room.
I don't know, Boss.
Maliciously destroyin' municipal property while under the influence. What was that?
Well, we ain't never had one of them. Where'd you think that was gonna get you?
Says here you done real good in the war: Silver Star, Bronze Star, couple Purple Hearts. Sergeant! Little time in stockades. Come out the same way you went in: Buck Private.
Well, you got yourself some time now. Two years. Hell, that ain't much, we got coupla men here doin' twenty spots. We got one who's got all of it. We got all kinds and you gonna fit in real good. Course in case you git rabbit in your blood and decide to take off fer home, you git a bonus a some time and couple leg chains to keep you slowed down a little -- fer your own good. You'll learn the rules. It's all up to you. I can be a good guy or I can be one mean son-of-a-bitch, it's up to you.
Wouldn't surprise me none.  Wicker Man says you got a hundred- twenny and some change in the Captain's safe and you got your five dollars pocket money... That'll buy you a whole fistfull of cards. You in or out?
Get away!
Yeah, those poor old guards need all the help they can get.
They ain't never seen a bull gang before.
Maybe we oughta call you No-Ears. You don't listen much, do you, boy?
No more than five. For a cold drink.
Kick a buck.
No. No chains either.
But you're dog enough. Maybe they'll let you sleep outside the box near your master.
You've been having bad luck with masters, haven't you? Your last one left you when the cops came... and now Luke. You should complain to the S.P.C.A.
Andy?
Stop acting like a silly little fag!
What first two murders.  We don't know about them here, do we?
When was that?
And you believed him when he told you he had done that.
Who was the man in the basement?
Where are you, Peter?
You don't admire me.  No police admire me.  I got one of you killed.  Why don't you say right out what you're here for?
Yes, I did.  Poor impulse control. The accounts of the firs two murders made it so clear they were the work of the same man, but you kept announcing they were unrelated.  You'll never catch him that way.
Look at the sign.  'Hell'?  In the Festival of Love?  You make any sense in that?
What's that music.  It's Abba.  I can hear it.  It's Abba.
I've got to go.  I've <u>got</u> to go.
MaryJane.  We call her M.J.
Is there a phone booth there?
Go and look for a note.
Well, there's something missing in there.  There was something around her neck when I came in there, but it's gone now.
Lieutenant  Quinn.
You know, M.J., when I watch you shoot, I realize I've got a little problem with my stance... could you just move over here and critique my legs?
You're right.  I can't stand that bastard.  Sorry.  This is something new.  Not the same guy, that's for sure.
Good.
You got a suspect...
I'm gonna drop charges on the break-and-enter at Hudson's...
Or the F.B.I.?
Give me Ruben back...
Yes, I fed her.  If she says she's hungry, she's lying to you.  Again.
She lies all the time.  Why would I say I fed her if I didn't?
I can't sit on this balcony forever. I'm beginning to feel like a potted plant.
Is the traffic heavier now? There seem to be three times as many cars as there were before the accident.
I thought she might come along. Handling a car again might be more tiring than I imagine.
You're not envious?
Haven't I? To the airport, if you could.
A complimentary ticket for a special stunt-driving exhibition. Definitely not part of the big auto show. There's a map in the packet and a note requesting you be discrete about the location.
I suspect it involves reenactments of famous car crashes. You know, Jayne Mansfield, James Dean, Albert Camus...
Serious. But you'll have to take your new friend, the female crash-test dummy. She dropped it off for you.
I did this already.
Have you been in contact with the principal about your job?
Then, you should call.
I think it's about that time, Letty. The charges against you have been dropped, the drugs have evened out and you seem to be dealing with your life quite well.
And the party?
Sage, rosemary...  Les Herbes.
No, no. They've got to be Puglia olives, packed in a light brine with a flavor that doesn't overpower the palate.
I'll be running it three days a week, and...
Not now, but maybe later, if they like the program.
Tomorrow?
A deal's a deal.
Letty.
I answered these questions last night.
I've already checked it out 17 times.
The lady knows this is a dandelion.
Oh, right.     I'm ready.   How do I look?
I was tired of watching what everyone else wants to watch. Now we can watch two shows at once.
Yeah?
I got worried. Are you OK?
I guess so.
You should go.
Paul, I just can't go. Is that OK with you or am I committing some horrible crime?
I'm sorry.  I'm just...I'm so tired lately.
No, it's not like that.
So, what do you say, Let?
I do apologize.    A student had a crisis.
I'm going to retire with a shit-load of money. Find me a small country that doesn't have an extradition treaty with the States and live the good life.
Yes I did.    Lose ends are messy.
When this is over you can say whatever the hell you want. I'll be long gone. Besides, who's going to believe you? You're just a two-bit crook.
You're there now?
You're calling me on your cell phone, right?
You're calling me on is phone?
My number's going to show up on his bill!
Yeah. Seems Maranzano wants to talk about buying the Merchant Street warehouse.
And nothing.     He's just feeling us out.
He sticks his toes in the water again, we'll cut 'em off.
I heard this quarter his profits are gonna be supernumerary.
Thank you.
Why do I always have to answer the phone?
I'm not any closer than you are.
And be careful when you get near the top. Zero has a very long one.
Do I?
You didn't think it was little suspicious that someone you only knew for a few hours wanted to sleep with you?
Can I trust you, Sami?
If they had taken us by surprise they would have gotten the tapes back. That would have left us with nothing.
You haven't answered my question.
I'm leaving you with my friends. I'm trusting you to do the right thing today.
You better.
You said don't do it, boss.
Oh, then we will have the house wine.
It doesn't matter where we go. Between Zammito and the FBI they'll find us. We have to end this here.
Oh, Marcel! I thought you were somebody else. If I knew it was you I would have never run.
He's over at St. James. They had to put two pins in his arm.
Feel free to correct him if you want.
And you don't speak French?
-- Zero isn't interested in your life story.  Who gets killed?
No, I like the bag. It would be good for the job tonight.
That's why we're only breaking one arm.
Like most things, I am nothing. It's the same for this sword.  All of it is simply a state of mind.
Then tell me where Jade Fox is.
Real sharpness comes without effort.
Go to bed then.  Miss has grown up, and is getting married soon.  God knows what the future will bring.
Autumn is coming.  I'll shut the windows for you.
I'm just borrowing some clean clothes.  I'm not staying.
I was just passing by and wondered how you were.
With all the traffic on your rooftop these days... it took me a while to get in here.  I can't wait any longer.  I was wrong to let you go.  Come back with me.  You'll be happy in the desert.  You'll be free there.
Jen...
She's out there, but I doubt she'll show herself.  We'll keep our eyes open.  Sooner or later, she'll come for the girl.
I doubt it.  This thief... it very unusual...
Who ever made that.
No further.  I'm serious.
Right.  You sure I can't just take you to the emergency ward?
Who?
Mister Funboy lives there?
Mom tried to cook.
You don't even remember...
Rowdy.  Let me fill in some gaps for you.
Your pain ends now.
Whoa, hey, whoa.  Business.
No shooting.
Forever.
About what you said today in the stable. I'm not a happy person.
You implied it.
No, it's okay. I mean I look at you with all your morals and values and well, YOU seem to be happy in your choices. I envy you. No bullshit.
Seriously, you're amazing. You have everything going for you.  You're smart, you're beautiful, you're determined. You're everything I want in a girlfriend.
I wasn't kidding. I'd like to take you out.
Why not?
Wait, don't hang up.
What are you doing?
Why are you doing this?
I thought you said we were going to be friends.
I have feelings for you.
That's not fair.
What are you saying?
I love you.
Margarita found them while cleaning your room.
Don't you raise your voice at me. Go to your room, now.
It's Kathryn.
I want to go home.
I want to go home.
I know.
I know.
Get out of here.
It's Sebastian. He's out of his mind.
I think he's high on drugs. He hit me, then took off. I'm afraid to be alone. Please come over.
Oh yes. I've read it over and over again. This baby's the real deal. Daddy's little angel. A paradigm of chastity and virtue.
It just so happens we're not in Kansas anymore. Our little angel's father has accepted the new headmaster position at Oakwood. She's staying with my aunt up in Connecticut while Daddy sells his house. Can you imagine what this would do for my reputation? Screwing the new headmaster's virginal daughter before school starts? It will be my greatest victory.
Care to make a wager on that?
Oh well, duty calls. Time to add another chapter to my work of art.
I hate it too.
She shot you down.
So what went wrong?
You're telling me you had the chance to fuck her and you didn't. God are you a chump.
Well done.
Like your step-brother Sebastian. I can't believe they didn't expel him after what he did to the school nurse.
It's really important.
That's exactly what I told Mr. Reed, but he insisted upon remaining home from business to talk to you, Miss Callahan.
You know what I wished, Daddy? I wished I could be a good girl.
You can't open it yet. You have to put all of them under the tree until morning.
Well, it seemed to me --
I'm never unfair.
I'm not shouting at you, but there's no doubt in my mind that you spoil this child!
Are you coming to see us. Miss Callahan?
I live right here.
You're upset about me -- I made you fight --I hate for you to fight.
I don't know yet.
No.
Well, I guess we're not a very proper family.
You wanted to share this moment with me.
Because it knows it can move with the swiftness of strong wind.
It's a warm breath -- warm and strong  warmed by the sunlight that shone on the deer's back in the hot summer; sweet with leaves and mosses.
It is wildness and freedom. No one can touch it.
I do suppose so. But if you were there yesterday, guess you can get there today.
Then I'll tell you a story  a lovely story. Do you know the story of Rapunzel?
Do you know the story of "The Headless Horseman?"
Look at me.
Little miss, you can't stay here. You've got to come with me.
I like to see her happy.
Jennifer gave her a make-over.
Good. Except for PMS.
Or if your boyfriend's an asshole.
My vision got worse again.
It is so hot in here.
It took me an hour to clean it up. That was not in my head!
I haven't gotten it yet.
I don't know. You have to take Sammy. He's afraid of me.
Well if he does, he didn't give you away. He must really like you.
No, I'm serious. How about we have dinner and I tell you about it?
Worried about what all your girlfriends might think?
Yeah right... You better go.
Yes, that's what we're looking for.
I'll make a note of that. Put the coverage on my desk.
Sometimes it's frustrating. Like this Gregory Jameson case. We don't even know what killed him. I'm putting together little details to see if we're missing something.
You know how moms always tell you to wear clean underwear in case you're in an accident? Well this guy wasn't wearing any underwear.
Yeah but a guy hung like a horse would need briefs to keep things in line.
A man killed in Central Park.
No, it's just... no one's ever said that. And I thought if someone did ever say it, I'd have to say it first and then they'd sort of say "I love you too" cause they felt they had to after I'd said it.
Like I had to say it? No, I wanted to say it.
I love you too.
Can't you bite me and then I'll be like you?
I'm staying here with you tonight. There's no getting rid of me.
No, I said it was our first date.
Tell her I'm eating.
That dude was torn limb from limb. No way a woman like that could have done it. You never seen blood on a chick's sheets from her period?
Oh, so you decide to be a cop? Seriously? You don't have sex with a woman cause she's on the rag?
I can tell she's not a killer. You just don't like her cause you have a hang up about menstruation.
It's a bit farfetched that Mark would rip guys to shreds just outta jealousy. This makes no sense.
Like a vampire or some shit?
The other one?
Jesus.  Small world.  Where's the photographer?
I'm afraid so.
Sorry, sir.
Patricia Crenshaw.
Who?
Why are they after you?
Don't know much, do you?
No.  Have a look.
Asks my name.  Over and over.  Just like a broken record.  Only thing is, I can't answer.  I've no idea what my name <u>is</u>.
That's what people keep telling me.
I have to go...
Yeah... You just want me to wave, right?
`Cause you know I can do other stuff. I mean,  if you wanted me to talk or...
Right.
Oh, sure.  Remember the convention speech?
You mean the press conference?  I have a couple of ideas I wanted to share with the country.
Like how?
Mild stroke?
Up and around?  Soon?
You scheduled a whole day with the First Lady?
Oh.  Excuse me.
I don't want him caring about his wife! What about the Vice President!
Dave -- I'm working.
I was gonna do something with Joan.
Oh my gosh...
Fine.
Oh... Thanks.
What?
The Vice-President...
Oh, come on, Bill.  Don't patronize me.   I'm not one of your little...  Turn around.  I'm talking to you!... Turnaround!
You1re leaving, too?
You have a lot of secrets.
Hi.
It's nice.
Maybe. We'll have a little talk first. Then....maybe...I can help you out. String him up.
I have looked bad for four years. Everyone in the world has looked bad for four years. Thank God looks don't matter as much as they once did.
How we gonna break the curse without a prayer or two.
What is it if it ain't a curse?
That sounds like a curse to me.
I'm sure that's true, miss. And that's why we're doin' what we're doin'. What's happenin' underground here is just what Lucifer planned for this sinful race o' man. But we're gonna beat Lucifer. We're gonna put an end to what's happenin' here.
That's why we didn't use prayers on this here white coat 'til after he was destroyed. We ready to fight when we have to. And we gotta fight now.
You think you can find your boat? There's a thousand little inlets and backwaters all through here. You remember all the ways you turned to get where you are now? You leave yourself a trail?
He's my contact for Chrissake! There's two crates. Can you get me into the hospital?
PULL IN! GET THE OTHERS.
Hey. Slow down. What is it?
That bastard. I didn't think he'd make his move so fast.
Oh, bullshit, Mary. It's because Rhodes is a prick.
We're both gonna leave. Leave the island. I've been talkin' to Tricks. We think we can smuggle out one of those inflatable rafts. They're crated up real small. They've got air canisters. There's food inside. Even a little motor.
Need what? Civilised order like we have down here? Christ!
For the good of mankind. That's what every monster-maker says.
Will do.
Needs Chris!  Must have Chris!
Oh come on, Pitts...
I told you, that's a secret.
No one, sir.  It was just me.  I did the proofing so I inserted my article in place of Rob Crane's.
It's Nuwanda.
Nothing, unless you object to having girls here.
It does?  What?
Huh?
Carpe Diem... seize the day.
Meeks.
I have something.
I don't know.
God, I want to do everything!  I'm going to explode.
What is it?
I guess.
Yes.
We have to make it to the third deck...
And where is our point of arrival?
I told you...
...there's got to be a way to access out back there...
You quit high school, lie about your age, join the navy, and next thing you know, four years are up and you need a way to make a living...
He's not coming...
Good! So maybe he also know where the hell am I going to get the parts I need...
A little to the left...
Line it up now, nice and easy...
You mean countries that are acknowledged by the UN...or like made up countires too?
Like Mamooli's country...
She fucked me.
She fucked you?
What do you think, Sal? Jesus, you think we'd miss this?
Well... you remember Cynthia?
Worse since she talked to who?
Elephants! Make way... I gotta get elephants!
Psst. Vince!
I don't know! I don't know either!
That's wonderful. I think you should... fresh air.
There's Vince!
It's ahead, Vince.
This is this, Vince. This isn't something else. This is this!
Merle? ... Merle's alive?  How do you know?
Merle gave me this?
But, Nick... Hey, I mean, where would a guy like Merle get money like this?
You loaded it, Vince! I saw you!
The fuck you didn't!... Gimme that!
He just wants me to make him cinnamon cookies like I made for you.
Kimberly!
Well, you've just been taken off the bench.
Later.  I want Doucet first.
I'm going to bring this down hard. I've got an A-1 badass killer loose, an election day after tomorrow, and I'm risking everything on you. You're going to bring him in.  I don't care how.  If you do, you'll get your freedom.  An official pardon from me.  A clean slate.  A good job.  A chance to get back with your family.  If you don't want to, I'll put your ass back in the freezer so fast, you'll forget you were ever defrosted.
And I want Doucet.
We seem to've come across a 211, sir.
Shut up!  Drop it.
There's no time.  There are civilians in there.  It's about to go down.
Well, I'm sure.  You're a cop.  I'm a cop.  Let's do what cops do.
'Bout the same time I busted Doucet I tried to nail this big-time dealer. I didn't have an ID, but I was close. Too close.  Gained the confidence of a badass named Dubbs.  He was going to turn me onto the big man.  He made me for a cop.  Mysteriously my fellow officers discovered ten pounds of heroin in my cruiser.
Nothing makes sense when you're a cop.
Great.  My partner's Marcus Welby.
With all this technology you don't even have to show up for work.  Who needs cops when you've got gizmos.
If you were set up, I want to find out who did it.
Remember, get the seat fixed.
Jabez! Careful --
No, Daniel -- they are not race horses. They are good old friends of mine. I call 'em Constitution and Bill of Rights, the most dependable pair for long journeys. I've got one called Missouri Compromise, too, and then there's a Supreme Court -- fine, dignified horse, though you do have to push him now and then.
Maybe you can, sometime, Daniel. I'm a farmer, you know, and like to show my farm -- but the thing I'd like to show you most, you'll have to see for yourself.
Well -- it's high and it's wide and it goes a long way and there is a wind blowing through it and a blue roof over it -- it's the hills up here and the rivers running south and the new States growing in the West.
You're wrong, Mr. Stone. There are people who live and die without e'er seeing it. They can't see the country for the money in their pockets -- And some think their state's the country, or the way they live is the country, and they're willing to split the country because of that. Well, I hope you'll meet all those, when you're grown. You'll meet the fire-eaters and the Circassian beauties -- that's part of the fair, to be sure. But if we'd had to depend on them, in a permanent way, the country would have stopped at the Allegheny mountains.
No, siree, it didn't. And it won't -- no matter what happens -- just as long as the folks at the fair believe in freedom and Union. So --  Giddyap, Constitution -- and let's keep going, Mr. Stone.
That's fair enough, Jabez. Man's got a right to mull things over. We'll drive round again, week or so.
What a fine boy you have, Jabez. How old is he now?
Well -- it seems to me -- I remember when you paid me--
Small? Oh, I see what you mean. Why, they vary.  Now a man like Daniel Webster, if I ever get hold of him, I'd have to build a special box for him and even at that, I imagine, the wing spread would be astonishing.  In your case --
That's just fine, Neighbor Stone -- but -- I have to be pretty careful of my seats of honor -- where I sit, I mean. You see, the whole country sort of has its eye on me, Jabez -- anybody in public life has that difficulty -- even you, Jabez. They watch us carefully, our neighbors and our enemies, and they see much more than we think they do -- and understand much more. My friends all like to think that I've got the good of mankind always at heart, and I've got to make sure that those I deal with have the good of mankind always at heart, too. Do you know what I'm talking about, Jabez?
You, Jabez Stone -- you and a lot of poor farmers, hereabouts -- good men of the earth who are in trouble because of you. Or -- am I wrong about those contracts, Mr. Stone?
They'd have a good neighbor, Jabez -- and that's worth much more than anything else -- much, much more!
Ahem -- Neighbor Stone, we want--
Oh, Jabez.
Will you come into town with me tomorrow?
I wasn't used to being big -- wasn't used to thinking in big ways. Now, I've made up my mind.
All right, Jabez ...
My son! Do you really think, Ma....
It's all right, Sheriff.
Let him try it.
The new girl -- Jabez says; she is from over the mountain.
Mary -- what love and trust could do for your husband, you've done. And frankly, in a very few moments, this is going to be no place for a lady.
I'll do my best, Mary.
My money? Why, Mister Stevens? What a quaint idea. Come over to the door. I want to speak to you privately. Stop throwing away that money. We mustn't let people see any softness in you, Mister Stevens.... People take advantage of softness, you know. Come out of there -- I'll give you an extension if you'll forget this stupid repentance idea.
The loneliness? Lonely with all your gold, Mister Stevens? That hardly makes sense.
You can talk to me ...
Why don't you?
Oh, that's what you want -- well, you can be perfectly honest with Jabez Stone -- now.
Dwayne Robinson, LAPD.  I'm in charge here.
Hey, I read the papers, I watch 60 minutes, I say to myself, these guys are professionals, they're motivated, they're happening. They want something.  Now, personally, I don't care about your politics. Maybe you're pissed at the Camel Jockeys, maybe it's the Hebes, Northern Ireland, that's none of my business.  I figure, You're here to negotiate, am I right?
Hey, business is business.  You use a gun, I use a fountain pen, what's the difference?  To put it in my terms, you're here on a hostile takeover and you grab us for some greenmail but you didn't expect a poison pill was gonna be running around the building.  Hans, baby...I'm your white knight.
The guy upstairs who's fucking things up?  I can give him to you.
It's useless to you!  There's seven safeguards on our vault, and the code key is only one of them!  You'll never get it open!
Put it down now.
I'm going to count to three...
We have a pregnant woman out there --  -- relax, she's not due for two weeks, but a marble floor isn't doing her back any good.  I'd like permission for her to more to one of the offices where there's a sofa.
Good enough.  And unless you like is messy, you'd better start taking us in groups to the bathroom.
Holly Gennero?
I've spent half my life on airplanes,   * I can recognize someone who just got off one.  I'm Joe Takagi, Mr. McClane.  I have ...something to do with this company.
It's a date.  You buy the ice cream.
What's it look like?  We're going in.
-- all we know?  We don't know shit, Powell.  If there's hostages why hasn't anyone asked for ransom?  If there's terrorists, where's their goddamn list of demands?  All we know is that someone shot up your car, and it could be the same flake you've been talking to on the radio!
Who the hell knows?  Maybe he was a stockbroker who looked at the Dow Jones and opted for early retirement!
Come on, nobody's gonna get hurt. If they were gonna shoot, they'd shoot now.
Yeah, well I don't blame him.
... armed robbery ...
What makes you think you'll be able to control it?
He hasn't so far.  I'm the one who can make a mistake.  That's what scares the shit out of me.
Give me the keys...
The TV ... they want to talk to you ...
Yeah?
No.  I had some legal training, but...
It was on the TV.
Oh, a long time.  Because I kept asking my husband where the heck could Junior be?  He wasn't around here.  I thought maybe he was in prison or some place.
No, not until after they killed him.
Yeah.
No, that's all.
Are you serious?  About throwin' a body outta here if we have to?
But do you mean in? ... But you just told him that if worse comes to worse...
But I want to know what you think.
I'll tell you right now - that I'm ready to do it.
They gotta stop sayin' that.
I just want to see all you young ladies are all all right in here.
I speak what I feel.
My God, Sonny - you oughtta see - Alla Brooklyn is here!  On all 3 networks!
I talked to the FBI, I told them about you, they said if you just come outta the bank it's gonna be okay.
Well, I'm only trying to get you outta this.  I told them you were in Vietnam, you always had good jobs, you were with Goldwater at the '64 convention, but you had marital problems...
I said you were never a faggot.
He was very understanding - you ought to talk to him ... Algeria?
Oh my God!  I don't understand.  If you needed money, why couldn't you come to me?  Everything I got is yours.  I got two hundred and maybe twenty-five in the savings.  It's yours.  You know it.
<i>Morning.</i>
Maybe you should fuck her mom then.
<i>I won't forget this, Domino. I'm sorry it turned out like this...</i>
Where is the money?
I think that you're lying. I think you know exactly where the money is.
Nice to see you again, Edna.
I can certainly think of one more!
Hello?
Fucking Map Quest. <i>Never again.</i> <b> EXT. DOWNTOWN GARAGE ROOFTOP -- NEXT </b> Ziering and Green approach a LARGE TENT. The WINNEBAGO is parked off to the side. Alf is inside... doing something with a WELDER on the front of the RV.
Real good.
I'm under the assumption that this is a free country and one can live where he pleases.
It's about turning that shit off and getting the fuck outta my pizzeria.
No!
OK.  OK.
That's it?
One has nuthin' to do with the other.
I'm getting paid...
Pretty soon I'll be making a move.
Fuck!  My money!
Naw, that's some stupid shit.  Now you know how I got that name.
I didn't say nuthin'.  You must have a guilty conscience.  What are you guilty of?
You must be guilty of something or you would have never come in saying the things you said.
Where we goin'?
I can run out and get it.
I can't be staying long anyway.
Long enough for us to do the nasty.
A quickie is good every once in a blue moon.
Then we'll do something else.
Trust me.
Trust me.
Fuck dat shit.  I deliver pizzas. That's what I get paid for.
Ya like him, huh?
Y'know, Vito, I know Pino is ya brother and shit, but the next time he hits ya, the next time he touches ya, you should "house him." Kick his ass.
If you don't make a stand, he's gonna be beating ya like a egg for the rest of your life.
That's what I think.
Forget it, Mookie.
Mookie, you're fucking up.
Tell 'em, Pop.
I'll tell you why!
Po, po, position...? Hey, here's thought, have you a bathroom?
Very good. Back in a jiff.
It could be anything. You're going to discover a whole new world when you get to school.
I don't follow.
Shift to your left.
Who's Captain Rob?
I know the type. Lives in the basement, smells like a sponge...
Sounds like a pirate.
Yeah, he's a pirate.
Peg leg?
Exactly! A pirate!
A-ha! You landed on Candyland! Now swallow it!
HARRY, he can and he did. And now it's on like Donkey Kong.
Wanna bet?
Don't snap at me like that. You're lucky I don't punch you right in the face.
What do you mean? We can't go in there or we'll be "it".
How true. But I still feel I deserve more than you do of this treasure. I mean, I found it.
I lugged it all over town!
But I ate your Mom's pie.
It was a diamond and you swallowed it.
HARRY, are we gonna build this thing or not?
Try one in a million!
I don't know what you're talking about.
You know, "some". The fag stuff.
I know, you want go for a ride.
"My dream date with Principal Collins."
Oh honey, I wouldn't miss this for the world.
You know I do!
Loser... oh yeah he was a loser alright. A big loser.
He was a big loser! What are you deaf!?
How baby-cakes? You've done it all.
The chest! The chest that I put my papers in.
The documents. The photos! The tapes! The evidence.
Sweetheart keep up with me for half a minute. The evidence of every scam we ever pulled. The evidence that's going to put us away for twenty years.
They are Fremen suits. I hope they fit well, my lord.
Do not interrupt!!! Do not speak lightly of the spice... ONE SMALL POINT...
My Lord?
Excellent!
You saw a part of what the race needs in the beginning.  In time you perverted the truth.  You sought to control human breeding and intermix a select few according to a selfish master plan.  How little you understand.
Too bad... thought they were Harkonnen.
Stop him, Jessica!
No.  I never drink -- wine.
The old ones were much spookier. They had castles, full moons...
The <u>women</u>?
I never thought of that.
Of course!  Dracula requires <u>presence</u>.  It's all in the voice, and the eyes, and the hand --
"Greetings.  I am Slick Slomopavitz, Seeker of Adventure." Audience laughs.  Applause.  "Say, that's a funny place to sleep."
"Oh, tract housing, huh?"  Laugh. "You need a new real estate agent."
Really?
So why didn't you do it?
But maybe not.
I was thinking about killing myself.
Eddie, I received a letter from the government.  They're cutting off my unemployment.  That's all I've got. Without it, I can't pay the rent...
I'm obsolete.  I have nothing to live for.  Tonight, I should die.  And you should come with me.
Did you see that kid grab Vampira's tits?
Yeah, she's really somethin'.
No, it's fine.  It's real!  In actuality, Lobo would struggle with that problem every day.
I told you, the octopus is made of rubber.  This is a piece o' cake.
Since I was a kid.  My mom wanted a girl, so she used to dress me in girlie clothing.  It just kinda became a habit.
This is my way of telling you --
Who do you think's been paying the rent?!  Who helped type your script, and did all your grunt work?!
I wanted you to say, "No!  I wrote the part for my girlfriend Dolores."
Like <u>what</u>?!
Oh my, this is very interesting.  Say... do you think it would be possible for me to maybe play one of these parts?
Hmm.  Those sound kind of small.  Oh, here's one that looks good: Janet Lawton.  I'd sure like to play her.
Ah!  Atomic Age stuff, huh?  I like it.  I'll tell you what, Mr. Ward.  Why don't you leave those film cans, and my associates and I will take a look at your little opus.  Maybe we can do business together.
Yes?
Don't worry.  You just haven't met right woman yet.  Oopsy.  That cabbage goes right through me.
Well, Mr. Weiss, I'm your guy.  I work fast, and I'm a deal: I write AND direct.  And I'm good.  I just did a play in Hollywood, and Victor Crowley praised its realism.
Yeah?  Whatever.  So did you like it?
Gee, I used every frame of film we shot.  Maybe they won't notice.
Um, I guess --
Why?!  I did all those things!  Hell, I even built the props.
Yeah!  Don't forget "Mercury Theatre"... And then every Saturday, I'd go to the little movie theater down the street.  I even started ushering there.
The poor girl's out of a job.
You don't wanna be noticed?
So how long have you known Eddie?
You shouldn't be embarrassed by the truth.  Mind if I order some hotcakes...?
Come on...
Ooh, the sister! She is hot.
Yeah, but when they went off people weren't making fun of them. They weren't bozos! I'm Pumpkin Ass again!
You know, everything you asked me to do I did. I call you for advice about Shari you say -  "Leave her be, see other people for a while." You just wanted me to get involved with Jill because it made for a better show.
No. You screwed up my life just so you could get higher ratings. You never gave a shit about me.
Tell me.
I'm gonna stick this right in your eye.
So do I. So what? I'm doing all right.
So everything he told me yesterday was a lie. Everything.
You're famous. Somebody called me. What are you doing in a place like this?
Ma...
And how is this helping? come on say, good-night to all your new friends and let's go home.
Ed, he needs a break. You don't know what kind of bad luck he's had --
I'm not. I'm not. I'm just Look -- you know, in a way, it's good. He got this out of his system now and he knows it's not worth it and, you know, someday if you guys got married or something --
Okay ...
Oh... how come?
What?
Come on.
In a second! In a hot second. Let me ask you something --
What?
All right. Let me ask you something... are you happy like this?
Oh Yeah? What's your master plan here?
It's me, Ed.
Let's remember how I got into this. "Please, Eddie, do this for me. I can't get a break." 
Yeah. My problem is I've got a brother who writes a sentence like "We grew up in a small, little bedroom." As opposed to a big, little bedroom?
Me?! That's you!
Do you still have it?
Ed?
Yeah. Why?
He ended up moving back to Milwaukee to live with his parents. I haven't heard from him in a long time. Poor guy. I warned him.
Dick... Dick,..
Tammy,  now we've come to a decision. He just think it would be best --
Not wasting any time, are you, Tracy?
Yes, I do.
Calm down, Tracy.  Just calm down.
As far as I know, they--
Hello, Tracy.
Take as much room as you want
Sure.
I also like bananas.
Sorry.
Have a great summer.  And good luck at college.
Yeah, plain scotch.
He's the opposite of you.  He's more like me.  Cold, calculating.
Seen him around.  He used to be a cop.
It's a surprise.  You like surprises, don't you, White?
Patchett uses a lot of ex-cop muscle.
He no longer works for me.  Find Susan's killer, Mr. White. I'll give you a handsome reward. <u>Whatever you desire</u>.
Susan Lefferts.
It looks like she was flailing, trying to get away.
Dick Stensland.  Had to be dumb panic.  If she knew him she would've been sitting with him... Right?
Man, why do you keep asking me that?
I never truck with no sissies!
Believed what?
Man, why're you talkin' about Larry?  His business is his business.
The youngest applicant by eight years.
I was thinking Detective Bureau.
Anonymous.  Probably nothing.
What?
Just don't shoot me.
I'm going to Lynn Bracken's.  I'll meet you at the Dining Car.
Oh, the best I ever had. Absolutely the best.
The silver screen's loss is your gain.
You want to know what Bud's like in bed?
When was the last time you saw her, Mrs. Lefferts?
Sid, how are they hanging?
Dope, liquor, hookers that look like movie stars.  Pierce Patchett has it all.
Don't know. Did you check everywhere? Maybe it was hidden in something. Maybe there was someone else--
Maybe you bumped into someone who took it and you didn't even know.
I don't know who he is.
Told by whom?
Really?
Well considering what a colossal douche bag you are, David, maybe I'd do best to simply kick your ass all over the capitol.
How do you know so much?
You used to work for 'em, didn't you?
Tell me about it.
C'mon.
Listen, Daniel, hang on one second.
Could you give me just a moment to talk to a friend of mine here? Not about this, but...Daniel?
Well, you know--
There's just, clearly, some administrative snafu. I'm sure this is the worst of it.
Yeah.
I'll see if I can, you know, work things out.
My guess is male, somewhere in his 40's or 50's.
Gimme a week and four guys from litigation and I'll have the Post pleading with us not to sue for libel.
I'm not goin' anywhere, Eric. I live here.
I don't know.
He's clever. He had help.
Sir--
I just meant--
I wanted to meet a man who could write such a long paper with so few adjectives.
I'm quite all right, thank you.
Now.
Now.
What do I love?  I love rice pudding, and water, the fish in it, hedgehogs! The gardens at our house in Freshwater - all my secret paths.
Don't go over it again, please.
I promise I'll come back.  I promise I'll never leave you.  And there's plenty of water and food. You can have a party.
Looking for the fossils.  Why should we wait until we're in London?  This girl was probably twelve years old.
Her hands and feet were tied.
I looked at them.  They're shrubs, small trees.  Exquisite.  And fossilized, rock hard. He walks away to the nose of the plane.
Cut the ropes.  I left a note, on his blanket.  At the next Geographical Society I shall await with great interest the announcement of the Fenelon-Barnes Slave Knot.  The Girl wouldn't leave, of course.  Her father had sold her for a camel. He turns over the propeller, the engine cranks up.
Okay.
You're the prettiest girl I ever saw.
Where've you been?
Are you planning to be the exception?
And you've forgotten yours.
I told her you can forget everything but you never forget your name.
You can't kill me.  I died years ago.
To arm-twisting.
Have to return the favor - take a few photographs for the army.
Yes?
Your friend?
Just go off.  I'll be quite all right.
Well then - yes.  Of course.
I don't think it does.  Anyway, he's indifferent to me.
Yes, for your hair.
Nya-nya-nya!
He's sleeping.
I'll tell him.  What is it?  Is it a mine?
Does he have to go?
What if you couldn't find him?  Sergeant, not today, please. Not this morning.
Why not?
There are times when you don't answer the phone.
Why didn't I think of that?
With that computer--nobody better. Out there...it's different. You twisted your ankle stepping over a curb on Madison Avenue.
Something of great value, something of such artistic and historic significance that only you could truly appreciate...
No. Why would I be?
Not a word.
Not bad. I didn't expect you to make it out.
I guess I have a more optimistic view of human nature than you do.
A lifelong problem, I'm afraid.
Our equipment has arrived.
Straight down the drive, right at the hedgerow, follow the lane. Don't blink, you'll miss it.
These rooms are solid stone. They haven't changed.
Yes, you can.  You can spoil a perfectly nice dance.
It's your mistake.
There is no big job.
Sure, it's only worth 25 million or so, don't bother telling me what you're going to do with it.
Where the money is.
No. You'll see when we get inside.
China will think it happened before midnight. Britain will swear it happened after midnight...
I'm not leaving without you.
Yeah, the lord of the manor doesn't haul his own groceries.
You damn well thought wrong.
Probably not.
Carlos isn't a friend; he's a client.
Well it oughta be, with all the work I put into it.
For what?
You did?  Wow, sorry about that.  Listen, Mario's a little not so bright.  He seems to think that you said --
Bullshit.  You're trying to feel less guilty about firing someone with three kids to feed.  Fuck if I'll help you do that.
Yeah.  Isn't that a shame?
Another raise wouldn't hurt.  And with all the time I'm gonna be spending on the road, I'll probably be needing my own cel phone, won't I?
Really?  It makes me sick.
You didn't care about my case?
Things like the head counsel for PG&E calling me with an offer.  20 million, plus attorney's fees.  Take it or leave it.
It's about 50 thousand per plaintiff.
I'm thinking ... I wish someone else had to make this decision.  50 thousand bucks is more than any other California toxic plaintiff has gotten. Ever.  But ...
And it's less than pocket change for PG&E.
Maybe.  but maybe not.  We still don't have anything linking this to PG&E corporate. Plus, there's the statute problem.  Plus, we're way short on manpower, so we'd need to bring on more lawyers ...
It's eight million dollars, Erin.  Eight million dollars.
Perks?  Jesus -- <u>perks</u>?
Yesterday.
Nope.  Maiden.
Not anymore.
I don't know.
Well, God damn it, Matthew -- Randy's mom doesn't work eighteen-hour days, and Randy's dad didn't leave her, so figuring out who's gonna take who where is a little easier over at Randy's house.
Just think of me as the person next door who likes it quiet, and we'll get along fine.
What do you mean?
What do you want, a joke?
Well, come to think of it, we did have a big event around here.  Beth started talking.
Yeah.  We were sitting around at lunch and she pointed at a ball and said, "ball."
Mm-hm.
That's okay.  I understand.
I'm real sorry, Laura.
I'm surprised Donna didn't say anything.
The Emperor?
Move this ship out of the asteroid field and into a position where we can send a clear transmission.
And code the signal to my private chamber.
The boy is our last hope.
We're not out of this yet.
Chewie, head for the bottom of the city.
Not likely!  Where are the speeders?
We'll have to go out on Tauntauns.
You bet it is ... and Luke's out in it.
Sit down, and shut up!
No kidding.  If this snowball's got nasty natives, they could be anywhere.
Or you ran into something ....
Yes, you do.
No lightspeed?
Something's wrong here.  Your friend Lando is very charming, but I don't trust him.
Chewie, do you think you can repair him?
Repairs ...
Take them, but I'm keeping a detachment of troops here to watch over them.
I'm altering the bargain.  Pray I don't alter it any further.
You've probably never done an honorable thing in your life.
What chance have we got in here? What are we going to do when they cut ...
Is there any chance of them surviving out there?
I thought you knew this person.
You are reckless!
This tree is strong with the dark side of The Force.  A servant of evil it is.  Into it you must go.
Only what you take with you.
Never.
Dr. Milo, please don't call my wife mad.
Perfect for the mission. Nobody else can pull it off - not an army, not a man.
We'll see.
What's in it for me?
What's the little black box do?
And I don't need to know. So fuck you, I'm goin' to Hollywood.
So what's the deal, huh? Go into L.A., find the President's daughter, secure the box, and bring 'em both out - and I'm free?
Tell the President to adopt. I think I'll like L.A.
You're gonna have to learn to respect the law, Snake. The United States is a no- smoking nation. No smoking, no drinking, do drugs, no women unless you're married, no guns, no foul language. It's a brand new day for you, Snake.
Right over there.
Looking to get out.
Which way?
Sewers. Come on.
Hershe, you were in Cleveland?
I sought only not to harm you, sir.
Lancelot, I will save you... Don't die.
Yes, yes, I know that. Everybody does. Lord Leondegrance is my only ally among the barons and the great knights. I can't lose him.
I must find the means to save him, then. I was hoping I could ask you for a little magic help, but if it makes you so tired...
...to ride out and meet them.
Rise, Mordred.
I recognize you only as my son, no more.
I'm going.
--Nothing!
People make you laugh?
Dumb riddles, Merlin. I am your King.
Look, I'm telling you again and you'd better believe it, I'm not about to put her in a goddamn asylum!
And I don't care what you call it! I'm not putting her away!
You're sorry. Christ, eighty-eight doctors and all you can tell me is all of your bullshit...
What is it?
Storage.
Good morning Karl. Oh Karl, we've got rats in the attic you better get some traps.
Uh huh. 'Fraid so.
Yes, I think so.
That's okay. I should've told you I wouldn't be in uniform.
Father?
Well, maybe he's sleeping.
Honey this is Father Dyer.
I came to say goodbye.
How's the girl?
Ah, that's good. That's all that's important. Back to business. Back to work. Bye now, Father.
Holy water.
But deliver us from the evil one.
I think the point is to make us dispair... To see our selves as... animal and ugly... To reject the possibillity that God could love us.
Bastards! Stop!
Look, Frankie.  You and Jack been playing here, a long time.
Right, twelve years.  Couple times a month.
So maybe it's time we took a vacation from each other.
It wasn't half full out there tonight, Frankie. I got six waiters standing in back listening to baseball.  I gotta move the liquor. To move the liquor, I gotta fill the tables. It's a matter of economics.  Me, I love you. I love both you guys, you know that. You're class.  But people today. They don't know class if it walks up and grabs 'em by the balls.
Accident?
My pleasure.
I hate your kids, Frank.
Only by relation.  Besides, they hate me, too.
They tried to electrocute me, Frank.
It was no fucking accident, Frank. The little one ...
She threw a goddamn radio into the bathtub. How do you explain that?
You got weird kids, Frank.
It's me.
Yeah.  Listen ... come out to the house tomorrow, will ya?
It's not family.  It's business.
We don't get a gig.
Something came up.  Don't worry, Charlie stayed true.  Both nights. I'll give you your share tomorrow. At the house.
Let's get it over with.
How about these?
Two years ago.  March.
Right.  I love you, Frank.
I love you.  I just wanted to say it.
Right.  The Royal.  When's the last time we were there?
February?
Right.  It's incredible how you do that.  Remember things.
Drove me crazy when we were kids. The way you never looked at the music. Miss Simpson would just play it and ...
Dignity?  Who the hell are you to talk about dignity?
Yeah?
Yeah.
This is where the auditions were.
We're finished.
What are we, an orchestra all of a sudden?
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I can't tell you how thrilled I am to be here. It's like a dream come true. And speaking of dreams ...
Piece of cake.
Maybe we should just listen to the radio.
He's just afraid to show it. Aren't you, little brother?
Yes, well, they are.
They are in tune.  But not with each other.
Uh, well ...
He doesn't bite.
Baker.
Because Blackie Carson books the Park and whenever we've needed a gig he's come through.
Just dinner and dance, right?
He called her.
Long story.
If I see him.
Why not?
What's a prom?
Eddie.
He's losing his teeth.
Like I had a choice with that anal-retentive Jon Archer rising my ass at the probation hearing.  At least he took an interest. You took off without leaving so much as a Post-it.
Let me have a look.
Eve, listen carefully.  The man you think is your husband -- isn't.
Apparently, fine.  He's coming into work.  That's the good news ...
Castor's still alive --  Technically.  He's a turnip, on total life-support ...
Not anymore.
I believe the phrase Dr. Hoag used was "titanically remote."  Who knows?  Maybe the trauma of having my face cut off pulled me out.  Or maybe God really is on my side after all.  By the way, I know you don't get the papers in here.
Pollux is -- what?
Walton, you have to let me see the warden --
Get rid of them.
Most of the current chiefs -- they must have pretty hefty prices on their heads.
Good, because I checked your salary -- and it bites.  How the everyday working-class stiff survives in today's economy is something I'll never ...
They say love is blind. Do you think that's true?
Good.  Because I'm fed up.
Is that tonight?
What about me?
Wheres my real dad?
No, honey. Go back to sleep.
Hey, is that really necessary?
There's no way I was gonna die in that deli...  Let's just say I've been on a lucky streak lately.
What the hell is happening to me?!
You know what the word glimpse means, J? Its by nature an impermanent thing.
Nice night for it.  I'll have Louis send your car home.
All in one tape?
Funny, Jack.  Im laughing on the inside.
No, Im serious...youre really stunning...
I mean back in college, you were a very pretty girl, theres no question about that.  But this...  ...youve really grown into a beautiful woman...
If you want to look at it that way...
Zeena...
But you always seem so certain.
Thats a big one for me, too.
Your pay check is a disgrace to pay checks.
I guess...some of them are probably faking.
A perk for what?
Dont worry about it, Jack...
Do I know you?
So we'll get egg nog.
I wouldn't know anything about that.
Tell me.  When you grew up in Brooklyn, how many astronauts did you know?  You went your own way then.  You didn't listen to people.  So why start now...?
Ben, the money's not important.  We could <u>save lives</u>.
Yeah, you and Debbie and perfect --
Got it, teach.
Hey, I'm Mr. Sensitivity now.  Clear the way, wide load coming through.
He <u>also</u> said we'd avoid that storm in space.  And we know how that turned out.
Victor must've taken him.
Oh, it is.
So are you!
I've never felt better in my life. When do you get off work?
Meet me at 4:01, top of the run. That'll give you a minute to freshen up.
<u>Girl</u>...?!
It's not just the money.  I could make money in my sleep.
History, Leonard.  <u>History</u>. Everything else is conversation...  How's the other matter?
Hilarious.
Never better.
Let's not jump to conclusions, we need a <i>massive amount of evidence</i> before making that leap.
No.  There weren't.  There was <u>you</u>. And <u>me</u>.  No variables, no math.  It was actually the simplest thing in the world.  But your head got in the way... like it always does.
I did.  I did, Reed...but I wanted <u>you</u> to be that man.
Just <u>find</u> him.
We understand your concern, but we've made our decision, Doctor. Any questions? Anybody?
It'll be close -- but there's still a margin of safety.
Tell him where he fits in, will you? I've got a few things to check out.
Can't remember?... What do you mean?
Yes, there's no time to spare. And those fibers can be quite tenacious.
Now I know...
No, it requires such absolute precision --
Oh yes, I'm sure Dr. Duval could. If we had the parts.
Captain -- head in the d1rection of the flow and drift with it.
Quite a piece of plumbing.
What about Dr. Michaels?
If those Corpuscles can take on air, no reason why we can't.  All we have to do is hook up the snorkel to that air chamber you were talk1ng about, and when Benes inhales, there should be plenty of pressure to force the oxygen into the tank.  How's that sound to you, Skipper?
Just what it is. Antibodies, destroying Bacteria -- or any other foreign invader that threatens the System.
Nothing you could see with the naked eye. But there's a microscopic radio-active particle inside.
Could I run a tube through that Wall, without harming Benes?
Then don't drift down further.
Wuddya do?  Carl looks around.
I don't think so. It's nice.
Jezhush.
One hundred! You lied to me, Mr. Lundegaard. You're a bald-faced liar!
Chaska.
Jerry, we're not just going to give you seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
Naw, I... Executive Sales Manager.
My father-in-law, he's the owner.
Jerome Lundegaard?
This is Reilly Deifenbach at GMAC. Sir, I have not yet received those vehicle IDs you promised me.
Mr. Lundegaard, that very well may be. I must inform you, however, that absent the receipt of those numbers by tomorrow afternoon, I will have to refer this matter to our legal department.
My patience is at an end.
Good day, sir.
No, no. I - I'd, I'd - pay you back the principal, and interest heck, I'd go - one over prime -
Well - it's cold, Margie.
No motels registered any tan Ciera last night. But the night before, two men checked into the Blue Ox registering a Ciera and leavin' the tag space blank.
Yah. Owner was on the desk then, said these two guys had company.
It's okay...
It's okay, Mike...
My car! My car! Tan Ciera!
I love you, Norm.
I'm afraid I have to insist you leave.
Okay.  Where to begin?  With your constant absenteeism?  With your unpresentable appearance?  You're up for review...
-- Instead of just waiting for their turn to speak.
The forwarding number.  I haven't seen you at any support groups.
You haven't been going to yours.
Really?
Like testicular cancer?
I've been going to debtor's anonymous.  You want to see some truly fucked up people?
Me too.  I got a stomach full of Xanax.  I took what was left of a bottle.  Might've been too much.
Okay.  Okay, I'm sure.
Nothing.
Your whacked-out, bald freaks hit me with a fucking broom.  I thought they were going to break my arm.
The were burning their fingertips with lye.  The stink was unbelievable.
Here comes an avalanche of bullshit.
Yes, fine.  Just, get on.  Stay away a couple of weeks, at least.
I wasn't really dying, I wasn't host to cancer or parasites; I was the warm little center that the life of this world crowded around.
What do you want me to do?
Why?  So you can say, "Oh, that's what you do." -- And be a smug little shit about it?
He farted on meringue; he sneezed on braised endive; and, with creme of mushroom soup, well...
You get the idea.
"I get cancer, and I kill Joe."
Okay.
Yes, I promise.
I said I promise!
It isn't... ?
We don't... ?
Imagine how he feels.
Nothing.
You never talked to me in front of anyone else.
What about them?  They're lunatics.
The house is rented in your name.
Night jobs -- while you were sleeping.
What about Marla?
Um, well... technically, no.
Defuse the bomb, please.
Yes.
It's the only way to get rid of you...
"Stuff."  Were the mid-terms hard?
I hope you're ready for this.
I was dead.  And came back to life. An EEG machine.  Where's Eugene?
Being alive after our time caused an outward ripple - a rift in Death's design.
I thought we were finished with this bullshit.  This is police work, not the psychic Hot Line.
Eighteen.  And it's "Hebrew".
Clean up?  I don't...
He can't breathe damn it.  I think his lung's collapsed!
No, I'm good.
You have everything, Kimberly? Credit card, cell phone, AAA card?
Fix-A-flat?  Road flares? Sunblock?  Mace?
Jeez, Mom, stop trippin'.
I think. But why'd they make him up like... Michael Jackson?
No.. I mean, I don't have anything on me. This won't be safe.
I wish you were on the plane!
Been on many planes that blew up, have you?
No harm. No foul.
WE DON'T NEED THIS NOW!
Insertion.  Call in to base camp by TRANSAT.  Proceed to point Tango November for rendezvous with our ground contact.  Indigenous agent. Co Phuong Bao.  We've been over this three times.
Where's your stuff?
Sometimes they do.  They're river pirates.  Opium runners.
You comin'?
Huntington Beach, California.
Nguyen is good boy.
Let's get that tent down!
Couple hours.  Let me buy you a coffee.
American.  Come to get you out.
Can you walk?
Keep it clean, Rambo, or I'll nail your hide to the shed.
I can't believe you lived with her for that long. If I had to live with my mother, I'd stab myself six times.
I don't understand you. What is the problem?
That's not true...You gotta ease up... Conversations have a life of their own. You gotta just go with it...We're having a lovely conversation.
It's not funny.  It's... sophomoric and mindless... and dumb.
Because it makes me feel good to see how not funny it is and how America doesn't know the first thing about funny which makes it easier not being a famous funny TV celebrity because that would just mean that I'm not really talented.
Hello, I'd like to speak to Lydia?
I don't know her last name... I'll be off in a second.
What... No... Lydia... I want to speak to... her name is Lydia... I...uh...
...<u>Forget it</u>... <u>Goodbye</u>!
Thanks.
He can't hear you.  Hi...I'm Dr. Weintraub....  I was on duty when they brought him in...I've been going over his record... He was brought in once before I understand...  ..."catatonic  stupor"...condition  rendered him non-verbal for a period of -...
I'm afraid not ... Then again, I'm not sure. The beating's bad but it's not the problem... It seems he's.. re-experiencing the catatonia... So, like before, he could snap out it in an hour or in thirteen months or thirteen years... ....I don't know. There's no way to tell.
Well, it's not unusual in his case... Sometimes victims of tragedies are subject to the brain's replay system. The brain never loses anything - it just stores it up and waits. A person could actually re-experience the full effect of a tragedy, long after the event took place. Are you relatives?  Well, it doesn't matter. We'll take care of it. He'll have to be sent back to the same institution.. 
You'd have the option to care for him at home but my advice is it wouldn't be the best thing for him. He needs hospital care. I just thought you could sign the release forms, but the city can do that. I wouldn't feel responsible in any way. There's really nothing you can do. I'm sorry.
Oh please!...I was born a Catholic in Brooklyn... I've been to hell and back.... I'll be fine...  ....Thanks...You're a gem.
Well, I don't understand.  What did you do -- did you pick my name out of a hat or... or... a list?
Well -- were there a lot of people in the room or just you or what?
Well, I mean... I don't know you... This has never... I've never won anything and... I don't have a VCR.
Did Phyllis in accounting tell you to call me?
Great place huh?
Thanks a mill --  And I'll give you a buzz as soon as I hear from the people upstairs and we'll get this thing off the ground... Thanks for stopping by, Jack.  Give my love to the wife and kids.
You can't just break into Langdon Carmichael's house. This man has done nothing.
All right! Listen - please...don't start drooling or...rolling your eyes when I tell you this but - You shouldn't do this..There is no Holy Grail.
Look, you're only sort of insane, really. People like you can lead semi-normal lives. You could get a job...
I take it back - you're fucking deranged... And you're going to get yourself killed trying to get in there!
No. I think you're a moron and I don't want to get into trouble.
Have you ever done any cloudbusting? You lie on your back and you concentrate on the clouds...and you try yo break them apart with your mind. It's wild.
It's just a bum...You know, there's enough in here for the two of you.
It sounds exciting.
It's ridiculous! I'm sitting here, listening to some asshole cracker compare his life to mine!
No, I'm not mad at you, hand. It'll be all right. Just spot and follow through...
I'll tell you...  ... l-a-t-e-r.
I can't talk to you right now, leave me alone...
Shut up.  You have bread, don't you, and a toaster of some kind?
Would you tell her Bobby's here?
I know.
No, I don't really think you're a freak.
What about Carl and Catherine? Is he just coaching her, or what?
Uhm hmm.
You're attractive, Tita. If you just did a little more with yourself...
Well, if you just maybe did something with your hair, or...
There's nothing to say, Tita...
Yeah. I said a week, and I've overstayed myself...
I didn't want to say goodbye to anyone.
I'll say goodbye to you, Tita.
I have played a few times. Here and there. As a matter of fact, I was once a rehearsal pianist for a Las Vegas musical revue.
Of course I do. It's music. You know...
Shut up...
Just give me a chance, will you?
At game, Carl.
Oh, my, "a summit conference." I wonder where I was, polishing silver behind the coal bin.
I hope I didn't hear that.
What do you mean "mass"... I have to come out and tell you, you're not that clean, either.
Well, you're not that bad, but some people... I mean, people's homes, just filth. I've been in people's homes...
In my personal thing, I don't see that. I'm seeing more filth. A lot of filth. What they need to do every day, no, once in a while, is a cockroach thing, where they spray the homes. And uh... can you imagine, if their doors were painted a pretty color, and they had a pot outside, with...
And they picked up! I mean, it wouldn't be filthy, with Coke bottles and whiskey, and those signs everywhere...
Then I want you to go to whoever's sayin' that and tell them to stop.
I did.
I kissed those girls.
I aint gotta prove nothin' to no girl, 'cause I got it like dat.
Eddie from Compost?
Wha'?
Yeah.
A girl named Amanda.
She's like this high, dark hair, skinny
She didn't say she had no man.
You mean her.
Sally Ann Cavanaugh. Oh wait, she couldn't work in your office, she's not from around here.
My God, you're serious.
Can I ask anybody now?
Your 'foolproof' way is going to land my ass on the front page while you're basking in Rio.
My associates did a biopsy on this man recently.  He's supposed to have a melanoma, or a carcinoma, some kind of noma. Hmmm. I can't seem to find any record of it.
That's it?
This was last month. So Alan Stanwyk does not have cancer.
He'll be so relieved.
I'd have been long gone.
Boy, what the hell's the matter with you?
Course he has. That's his wife.
What's that?
I didn't sell nothing! I didn't sell nothing! I just carried the drugs from the Chief to Sam.
Fletch, I never sold nothing.
Where am I going?
They serve dinner on the flight?
You've certainly thought this out, haven't you?
You sure those doors will be open?
The gun, the money, the tickets, and the dying.
You sure got the hard part.
Nothing to it.
I have this effect on lots of women.
Say, the reason I asked about Alan is that I bumped into him this morning and you know what I can't figure out?
I can't figure out why I went to Utah for the morning.
I'm such a heel. How'd you guess?
You are a rich woman.
It's amazing.
Your bone structure, shoulders, neck...
Just like Alan. It's freaky.
Depends on the question.
No.  I mean, 'no you can't ask me that.' I mean, ask me something else.
Because I'm bored. Oh, that sounds terrible, doesn't it. I'm sorry. If it makes you feel any better, I also let you in because I'm hungry.
Utah is not exactly a cure for boredom.
Oh, listen to me. I've never even been there and look what I say about it. Anyway, I know there'd be nothing for me to do. I don't even know anybody there.
He never sees them and I never met them.
I decided I was going to tell my husband about you today.
But first I called the Hall of Records in Provo. They checked on the deed. You're telling the truth. A minute later Alan came in the room and asked me why I was shaking.
Far out.  Larry? It's Fletch.  Well, it's not 'Fat Sam's', but... any port in a storm.  Oh, tell Frank I need a couple of months. The fifty grand's lasting longer than I thought.
Why not? Oh shit... really?
Jim Swarthout?
I need you to find my little sister. She goes by the name Zuzu...
But how did you know?  Here, take this picture...
We invested in these factories. In Vancouver.
No prob...
You're a fucking gentleman.  What do you want from me?
What are you doing at the office? You wouldn't believe what I've gone through tonight... I'm calling from the Mega Beta Pogo Sorority.
I don't know.  I'm so scared. Help me.
Stop.  We still got serious detective stuff to do, but we've been up all night so we should hit the sack for...
As Clark Gable said to Ava Gardner in Mogambo:  'Fuck the purse, we're gonna die-e-e.'
Ye-ah.
Yeah, Ford.  I'm okay.
Well, I got some good news and some bad news.
Good news is that yeah, I found him.  The bad news is...
<u>I'm.  The.  Biggest.  Sissy.  In</u>. <u>The.  Wide.  World</u>.
Yeah, yeah, I know the third one unscrambles the high bits and the low bits.  Shit, just start torturing me, man.  I didn't even know Johnny had a disc and I can't deal with any 'Don't play games with me, Mr. Fairlane' bullshit.
Julian, you're fired.
I'm clean.
No. 
Goodbye.
I'm going to put them on the cat.
Fake it.
Strike out, eh?
A piece of ass wouldn't kill me.
Morning.  Sometime.
Drink this.
Tell everybody we'll be back in an hour.
I say we keep sittin' on Boca.
Joel, don't jerk me.  I spent a lot o' time settin' this one up.
Stay with me, Gib.  We're gonna do this.
Did he?
It was under control, Bud.  Butchy's just getting tight in his old age.
I gotcha, I gotcha Chief!
He's not gonna stop, Satch.  He's gonna keep on...
WB2YKXB, who've I got?
My dad's name was Frank Patrick Sullivan, he was a fire fighter and a die-hard Mets fan.  And every night when I went to bed he sang to me...  Take me out to the ball game, take me out with the crowd...
Too busy playin' ball, huh?
Dad...Dad... There's... I need to...
Something happened, something...
It's Mom.
She's not here.
She...she died.  It's like it just happened.
No Dad, it happened a long time ago, a long time ago for me.
You there?
Just a minute, John...okay?  Don't go away.
Longbranch...?
Ten?  No.  I remember this case.  Three. He killed three women.
Oh, I loved it.  I wish you'd gone.
You work too hard, John.
You have the right to remain silent.  If you give up that right...
Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.
I vote for me.
Nothin'.  I was just foolin' around.
What?
Sort of.
Keep looking.
I have to.
I just want you to like me.
Being a jerk is better than being nothing.
You don't to say it.  I can tell.
That's it.  We're driving this baby back to town... in reverse.
This is taking forever.  I'm starving.
My ass.
Daddy, what is going on?
Wait a minute. I just...
Who ya calling?
Hold it.  Whoa... What's your name, son?
Please don't do anything crazy.
I'm here.
June the 19th.
That's all right.  I was just...
I'm sorry.  I have to bring you to a cell.
I know, I know, I'm sorry but the Sheriff is just berserk right now. C'mon.
No. And I'm not losing any sleep over it.
So what else is new?  Look Eva, you're asking the wrong dude to feel sorry for Tamara Mason. Wise up -- it's not hip to be her friend.
Ask me in about five minutes.
The fire alarm...
Charles, there's someone else coming along too.
A wonderful choice of places to dock a boat, Mr. Robertson.
I'm not staying in my room, Uncle Charles.
It's not that simple.
Whenever I get near the water, I see this young boy drowning. He tries to pull me down with him.
What do you mean???
You are going where?
Very bad today.
She wants a divorce.
It's over, finished and done with.
I'm completely stunned. I don't want this to happen.
Don't needle me, Elliot. Tell me how bad you feel. We're suppose to feel bad together. This is what friends do.
It's your best play, Nicky.
He'll kill it. He'll write a review so devastating it will shatter your career and cause the most unmanageable psychic grief. What happens to your apartment on the East River? Your house in Connecticut, where you watch things grow.
This is how we've managed to last.
In and out of bed.
We don't even like each other, do we?
I have a class. I'm late.
I'm not sure.
We're strangers in the night. The last thing we want is honesty.
Mystery. Deception.
What's sexy?
Even if the truth about a person is sad or depressing or shocking?
They're always winning. Until they lose.
Get yourself something to eat.
Wife and daughter. My father's still alive. He outlives me, starting tonight. Because the Mets just tied the score. It was only a matter of time, wasn't it?
I don't know Toyota. What does he do?
Why does it matter?
Why do you care?
No. They're not your team. They're my team.
To go to the theater. Wears I don't know what. Make-up, padding.
Because he is so deeply hated by so many people in the business.
Our Steven not only disguises himself.
He goes to the theater armed.
Everyone takes his turn.
In this place there are no untouchables -- and no work is beneath any of us!
All the more reason.
One more.
Ah, but my puritanism runs the another way. I'm far too modest for such a display.
The Government's afraid, and they don't know what to do. But they're more afraid of terrorists than of you. The Viceroy has agreed to your release if you will speak for non- violence.
Even as a boy I thought so.
I --
There is nothing I can give.
Somehow I expected not.
If you did this, no one could control it. No one.
It would be five thousand more.
A customer?  Does this Michael's cater to misfits?
What a relief.
I think I'd better choose the menu.  After all, you're learning how to be me, I'm not learning how to be <i>you</i>.
Listen, I don't want you to think I'm ungrateful --I know you and that little broker--what do you call him?
You're both going to a lot of trouble--  Maybe you can con somebody into believing you're me to get your foot in the door--but once you're inside, you're on your own.  I'm sure you're sincere...  ...but I was being groomed for something like this myself.  Even without the accident I don't think I would have made it.  My point is--how the hell do <i>you</i> expect to pull this off?
You're right, there's more atmosphere where you're going.
I'm sorry.  I think I was crying.
Have you forgotten?  I don't need any samples where I'm going.
That's the hair color in his profile?
You celebrate, Jerome?
You remember the '99 Chrysler LeBaron? It's the exact height of the front fender.  Looked right instead of left.
But "if it came to it" then it couldn't have your--  --nose.  How perfect does your child have to be?
That's precisely what <i>scares</i>me--that they won't do anything <i>foolish</i> or <i>courageous</i> or <i>anything</i>--worth a Goddamn.
I can't do this.
No, you don't understand.  I <i>can't</i>.
Beynon.
It looks fine.
Sure.
My mind's not on guessing games.
Fifteen minutes.
When are you going to learn?
It's all a game, don't bother me.
Get your clothes on, move your butt.
Oh my God.
Just fine.
Mexico. I'd like to find a quiet place to cross.
That right?
How long have you been married?
Can he trust you?
Fine. Nowt wrong with them.
He was drunk. Drunk as a lord.
I can't Jack. How can I?
You bloody whore. Frank was too careful to die like that. Who killed him?
Especially when I play the lead.
Yeah.
No.
That's nice. What'd you tell him?
Good lad.
I'll bet this one's seen some action.
That little shit!
What about Keith?
Pension him off.
What am I supposed to do?  I don't know where they've taken him. Do you?
Very...  So, who you working for these days Eric?
What are you doing? Advertising Martini?
Yeah,  Come off it, Eric. Who is it?
I have to. Things to see to.
Yeah, I'll do that.  Told you it wouldn't take long, didn't I?
That's right, Harry.
They killed the goose.
And now...
We're stuck with this fucking shit...
It's too...
Eh?
You get a bad month, all of a...
All of, they got you on this "board..."
Some contest board...
It's not right.
What could we get for them?  I don't know.  Buck a throw...buck-a- half a throw...I don't know...Hey, who knows what they're worth, what do they pay for them?  All told...must be, I'd... three bucks a throw...I don't know.
Is that what I said?
He would take you on.  Yes.
Uh-huh.
Was I?
No.
No.
When I talk to the police, I get nervous.
No, who?
Why?
You think so?
'Cause, you know, 'cause they weren't, I know that Mitch and Murray uh...
Would you excuse us, please.
Shelly, you blew the last...
...you didn't close...
And fifty bucks a lead.
The leads are coming.
I talked to Murray and Mitch an hour ago.  They're coming in, you understand they're a bit upset over this morning's...
I want to tell you something, Shelly.  You have a big mouth.
Will you shut up, I'm telling you this...
Guess who?
Sure.
Which...
Uh...
Home cooking...
Oh!  For the magazine...
Well, it isn't coming out until the February iss...sure.  Sure, go ahead, Ricky.
Gimlet.
Lingk.  James Lingk.
The check wasn't cashed?
Not to my knowledge, no...
They didn't get my contracts.
Your check as cashed yesterday afternoon.  And we're completely insured, as you know, in any case.
Go on, answer him when he talks to you.  Tell him: Columbus, Marconi... Garibaldi.
I just had a drive; besides, I want to see my brother-in-law Michael.
I'm a little short.  I've been out of work.  Let me owe you the money for a few weeks.
No.
 And he agreed?
Yes.
I don't know.
No.  But if they do have somebody, you'll do three years for perjury if you give them so much as a wrong middle name.
Mike wants it.
We know you're a busy man, with plenty of enemies -- we saw the opportunity to do you a favor, and we did.  No strings.
You know there's a Senate Investigating Committee recently set up; we thought it would be unfortunate if they were to trace anything though-provoking to your name.
Do you gamble?
Do you owe markers?
Have Tom Hagen meet me in the Harbor House.
We're making a big investment in Cuba.  That's my only concern.
The money was sent.
I wouldn't consider anyone else.
He's very kind, tell him it's appreciated.  I'm sure it will be profitable all the way around.
Turnbull is a good man.
I told her I would speak to you, that you are a reasonable man who acted out of some misunderstanding. She has gotten rid of the animal that caused all the trouble, so why shouldn't she stay.  As one Italian to another, I ask you the favor.
How much more a month?
What's to be jealous of?
Not so famous any of us have ever heard of him.
Tea is fine.
But I didn't do this!
We have his note.
But how're you going to explain this?  How did you get him out of the pool?
You mean -- you really want to draw me?
But why?
And it's just my head you want? Nothing else?
You don't want to draw pictures of me in my birthday suit, right?
I don't mind.  I'm not crazy about my old man either.
It will only make you self-conscious.  You'll have to remove your shirt.
But we have to match the other sketch.
I assure you, Mr. Boone, I meant no --
I'm game.  Sure.
Clayton is fine.
Catch my death.
Is that why you joined the Marines? For your father's sake?
What happened?
What was that?
Hasta la vista, Boone.  And give the jail bait a squeeze for me.
She took the night off.  Heavy date.  Some guy she's had her eye on for a while.
Only a mad scientist could do this to a woman.
In the sequel, James, two lady scientists should make a monster. And our monster would be Gary Cooper.
More your line.
Yes?
Of course.  This afternoon.
Everything.  Start at the beginning.
Of course.
Only hurts when I breathe. Lookit you. Where are Barney Fife and Aunt Bea hanging out? And Opie ... Where's Opie at?
Yeah Tell him to lay off Kip and them Tell him it's on
Your brother has four days. Fifty cars. Five-zero. For that he gets 200 large ...
What for?
You know my back.
You got a school teacher or Nancy from accounting, you don't put on Sly Stone or James Brown. You put on Ravel. Rachmaninoff. But if you got some wild one you just picked up at the track, you wouldn't put on Cat Stevens or James Taylor. You'd put on Prince. Or Isaac Hayes. Or, if you really wanted to get after it: Miles.
It's the same way with cars. Different cars. Different tunes. You can't steal a Maserati listening to Sinatra. You gotta get urgent. You gotta get Sonny Rollins or Led Zeppelin IV, on that shit. But never, never-ever take no Allman Brothers into a Lincoln Town Car. Could lead to disaster. Got it... ?
Good.
Peugot convertible ...
Gray.
There's no one left ...
You, too, Ma...
How's Kip?
Oh, for God's sake
Hello, Memphis --
About what?
About Calitri? No worries, man. I'll call him. He's a reasonable dude ...
I'm cool.
Thought I'd go for a ride -
Where we going -- ?
Kip took a job. Fifty ladies in two weeks. Only the two weeks have turned into four days. And not a single lady has been snared.
Six or seven...
I understand -
Oh, yeah.
How is he -- ?
Are you considering a comeback tour?
It can be done. Take two days to shop; one to prep. I'll offer up my bible for a small fee. You also have to hope Kip's jerk-circus didn't undo Castlebeck's linkage so much so that he's setting up surveillance teams on every city block. And then get yourself a crew...
"A people is a detour of nature to get 6 or 7 great men - Yes, and then to get around them..." Nietzsche said that.
The old crew. Go find them. I can't help you with that. Since I've cleaned up the act a bit, they no longer come around... A pity how legitimacy makes you unpopular -
Who's "Eleanor?"
Why do you call it "Eleanor?"
Shit all looks the same here --
You treated me like shit.
How much?
She's beautiful.  Look at her. Henry, look at her.
Paulie was just talking about him.
What?
It's been six months.
If Paulie finds out, we got problems.
He was jumpy. He hadn't touched a thing. In the old days, Jimmy would have ordered doubles and eaten it all.  On the surface, of course, everything was supposed to be fine. We were supposed to be discussing my case, just like we always would, but I had a feeling Jimmy was trying to sense whether I was going to rat him out to save my neck.
How?
Yeah.
Yeah.
What for? I got a pound of stuff in my jacket I've been carrying around all day. We gotta start taping it to your leg.
Jimmy just stood there on the sidewalk. It felt funny. I started walking down the block, but I noticed the stores were empty.
That fuckin' guinea, Will knows him.
Jesus Christ. Not even close.
Gone.
She went to Medical school in California.
Oh I'm sure, that's why only one of us has herpes.
This is your house, right?
All right Morgan, fine. I'll tell you why we're not going to "Kelly's." It's because the take-out bitch is a fuckin' idiot. I'm sorry you like her but she's dumb as a post and she has never got our order right, never once.
You're walkin' bitch, Will's takin' the car.
Hey, I'm the last guy to want to talk about school at the bar. But as long as you're here I want to "seize" the opportunity to ask you a question.
Yeah, can I help you?
No students work for me.
Which one's your building?
Oh, come on! You're not pinnin' this one on me. He left, I wanted to talk to him for another twenty minutes. I was havin' fun.
C'mon, that guy was a fuckin' piece of work.
I appreciate that.
This kid's special, Sean. I've never seen anything like him.
I think so.
We haven't really gotten into it. LAMBEAU Maybe you should. My phone's been ringing off the hook with job offers.
Cutting edge mathematics. Think tanks. The kind of place where a mind like Will's is given free reign.
Sean, I really don't think you understand--
I don't know... Gotta be at least four to one.
You're pretty quick with those numbers. How about the odds of me buying the first round?
Now you know Will, and I know, what you need to be doing. You have a gift.
--you have a quality-- something you were born with, that you have no control over- and you are, in a sense, hiding that by becoming a janitor. And I'm not saying that's wrong. I'm friends with the janitor that works in my building. He's been to my house for dinner. As a matter of fact I did some free consultation for "Mike" -- that's not his real name. That's in my book.
Yes. The pressures you feel, and again, I am neither labeling nor judging them, are keeping you from fulfilling your potential -- you're in a rut. So stop the Tom Foolery -- the Shenanigan's, Will.
Will, your not getting off that easy.
Like what, Will?
What places?
Time's up.
What?
Define that.
Yeah.
You're Welcome, Will.
I'm gonna travel a little bit, so I don't know where I'll be.
You know what I mean. I know you've at least thought about it.
Yes you have. You were thinking you were gonna get a good night kiss.
Yes you were.
'Cause it's nicer than my place.
Exactly.
They don't come over here that much.
Aah, it's kind of a hike.
All right, all right. We'll go.
Sometime. I don't know. Next week.
I'd say...  It's only four in the mornin', they're prob'ly up.
I love you, Will.  No take-backs.
How 'bout you?
But ain't no reason--
Okay. I think you're a darn fool, though.
We got to get outa here right away. Ever'body here? Where's Uncle John?
Sure, but what is this?
Joad.
Four.
Two.
Two.
Why, I guess so.
I never heard nothin' about it.
We was outa food. Tonight we had meat. Not much, but we had it. Think Pa's gonna give up his meat on account a other fellas? An' Rosasharn needs milk. Think Ma's gonna starve that baby jus' cause a bunch a fellas is yellin' outside a gate?
Sure, but you'd a throwed a fit if I hadn't tol' you.
Ain't nothin' the matter. I just ain't a-goin', that's all.
Why, sure. It won't be so bad once we get her washed out.
This got a floor. Wouldn't leak when it rains.
They charge extry at the comp'ny store but they ain't no other place.
Ya say we're acrost?
Thank God!  An' we're still together-- most of us. 
No.
Granma's dead.
Since before they stopped us las' night.
I was afraid they'd stop us an' wouldn't let us cross. But I tol' Granma. I tol' her when she was dyin'. I tol' her the fambly had ta get acrost. I tol' her we couldn't take no chances on bein' stopped.
Don't know--but it's better'n this.
They come. They come and pushed me off.
Can't tie him. Either we'll hurt him or he'll git so mad he'll hurt his self.  Reckon we could git him *drunk*?
Awright, go on! Ain't nobody stoppin' ya!
I ain't gonna fret you. Go on!
I seen 'em b'fore you did.
Now don't you go monk'ing--
Wonderful.
Whatever I can get away with.
You open 'em up and there's the sayings, stories, little bites of insight. It's the P.P.P. Six Day Week.
Yes.
Correct.  That's for you. Keep it.
Yes.
Yes.
No.
It's something I do...
Maybe some of the discomfort you're feeling is... guilt. Remorse. Over the innocent people you've killed.
What stuff?
Not me. So don't paw at me with your dirty little guild.
That sounds pretty interesting...
He using her.
One cannot love and kill.
I'll do it tomorrow.
Same thing that happened to you-- I stopped poutin' there on the sidelines. Got in. Got on the team. I joined the working week, you slick fucking asshole, so why don't you valet park your high horse and take it easy on your old buddy, Paul.
Good evening, Mr. Blank.
Martin, I don't know where you've been since you abandoned my daughter ten years ago, and I don't care. It was good that you left, and I'm glad you did. So what do you want to talk about? You've grown up a bit. Maybe I had you figured wrong.
I visualized you, in a haze, as one of the slackster, flannel-wearing, coffeehouse-misanthropes I've been seeing in Newsweek.
Oh, you know me, Martin. I'm the same old sell-out baby-boomer, exploiting the oppressed I got shot for at Kent State. But why don't we have a drink and forget the whole thing?
Well, it's worth it, really? I mean, how much longer do you think you need to work with Pilgrim?
Why don't you ride anymore? Grace told me you used to ride when she was younger.
That's very important to you, isn't it? Home.
How did you find out all that?
Why?
Whatever you want.
Fine.
Hi.
FOR YOU! Because I'm your daughter which means you're the best mother! Isn't that what you're always talking about in interviews -- having it all, the great career, the great family... Proving everybody wrong. Wanting everybody to think you're this perfect woman!
Well... honey... you know... that's just not his way. Maybe you can write him a letter or something. Say thank you... Don't think about it... You take care and I'll see you home.
That's okay. We have to talk about it and we're not always in the same place ... so... I just have to get used to it.  What do you want to do about dinner?
Sing it to me, Frankie!
Taking forever. I just got an additional list of sixty-two employees to interview before Monday. I don't know how I'm going to do it.
Mmm. I made good time.  Pilgrim's in the back. I found a new stable, but they can't take him until tomorrow.
It's fine. Comfortable. I still can't get used to how dark it gets around here, though. When we leave the ranch, I always hold my breath until I can see the motel.
Annie, I'm not good at this kind of talk -- goes round and round a thing but never comes to it -- so let's just say what it is. When you first came here, I didn't like you and I was worried. Tom means a lot to me and this family. Don't go looking here for whatever you looking for. Don't make that man go through something it took him a long time to see his way clear out of the first time.
He's a good man, Tom is. He's got a gift, come from heaven above, I swear. But he's still a man. And a woman can lead a man into the middle of a mountain lake -- and still make him think he's on dry land.
Oh hell, I don't know... According to Tom, she's a pretty determined woman. Must've thought it was worth it.
That's what some folks say.
He thought it was a ghost.
I don't have all day.
You want to go to a movie tonight?
So?
Maybe... look -- just...
I haven't been back in over twenty years, but I wouldn't be surprised. The population's larger.
Hack the Planet!
Shh!
Yo, brain dead, the manual!
Difficulty rating?
Right. If I win, you wear a dress on our date.
That's bullshit.
You lay a finger on her and I'll kill you.
And judging by this segment alone, it's already eaten about...
What?
You're the moron that's been invading my turf?
I got a record. I was Zero Cool.
Yeah.
We caught 'em.
Red handed! You won't be having any more trouble from them.
You know, you're right about that.  Check it, Friday.
Virus?
Excuse me?
What, it left a note?
A patient pickup and transfer to Smith's Grove.
Yeah.  Should be on the road.
Real charmer.
All right.
She's not dead!
You'll have to watch Jamie tonight.
Well tonight is very important for your father and me.
Its too late.
Its not exactly the end of the world, for goodness sake
I'm Dr. Hoffman, Medical Administrator.
Ready to go.  Who signs for him?
Outside.
I can't sleep.
Do you love me Rachel?
Like a sister?
Like a real sister?
Coming.
I'm ready. I'm ready. Okay, let's go.
No.
Right here, Ben.
No problem, Sheriff.
He's been here.
Batteries. I planned the generator for the house next week. I wished I hadn't waited.  This is squawk 79er zero of Haddonfield broadcasting on the state police emergency frequency. Can anyone hear me?
Hi, Dad. What happened?
What happened?
You blame everything on kids.
Look where?
This has not been my night. My clothes are in the wash, I spilled butter down the front of me, I got stuck in a window...
I can't.
He went out drinking beer with Mike Godfrey and he won't be back until late. YOU'LL have to call him tomorrow. Besides, I'm on my way to pick up Paul.
Annie probably took Lindsey out or something. Let's look for a note.
Not since 1963, since it happened. Every kid in Haddonfield thinks this place is haunted.
Totally.
I'm so embarrassed. I couldn't face him...
There's nothing to be scared of now. Get changed.
He asked me if I could help him find his purple lawnmower.
He said something else. "It's all right now. He's gone. The evil's gone."
You want to see some?
Well, let's do it.
Oh, is that what it is?
Right.
Yeah, it was funny, it was very funny.  But the show was about the two Frenchmen, now that was funny and it was warm.
Uh-huh.
Let's take a look.
Hi.
...ex-husband on the street the other day.
Oh, yes.  Who doesn't?  Look!
Yes, he's just adorable.
Look, don't do anything on my behalf.  I live with Frederick, and Hannah and I are close.
Oh, Elliot, please!  I can't be a party to this!  I'm suddenly wracked with guilt just standing her talking to you on the street!
It's been nearly a year since our first time and you're still married to my sister, which...I now realize is fine because you're probably much more in love with her than you know.
Yeah.  Uh, well, sure we did.  An- an-and in a way you led me on, because I truly believed you were unhappy with Hannah.  Otherwise, I would never have let myself be drawn in.  I was very weak.  So were you.  Now I've met someone else.
Was I?
Well, I-I don't think it's a very good idea.
Because it's the last thing in the world we need right now.
I don't know.
But, you got four children!
Well...I-I think we should wait till things settle.
You know, y-you have some very set plans on how your life should be structured.  A-a house, uh, kids, certain schools, a h--, a home in Connecticut.  I-it's all very...preconceived.
I-I-I know, but there's got to be some give and take.
Get his wine away.
Oh! 'Cause you won't exist!
That thought doesn't terrify you?
Based on what?  You never even see him.
Jesus...Jesus!
Oh...
Mickey, you're off the hook.  You should be celebrating.
Yeah...but you're not dying!
Why?
Oh, Hannah, she's-she's just embarrassed in front of you, that's all.
Huh?
Fro--?  You want a-a defrosted kid? Is that your idea?
With a, with a stranger?  With a--
Mmm, I never get upset over that. Mmm?
It's, uh, you never know--
He's not a loser at all!
He's the headmaster of Daisy's school.
Uh-huh.
But what I decided to do is some writing.  Yeah, I think I've had it with acting.  You know, these meaningless auditions at cattle calls.  And I can't handle another rejection.  Now let's face it here.  I gotta, you know, latch on to something in my life.  You know--something with a future.  I'm not sixteen anymore.  It's just...crazy!  I've got...an idea for a story. More than one.  And I just need a few months, you know, or, uh, a year even.
You make it sound like, you know, I have no needs or something.  You think I'm too self-sufficient?
You're grateful, but you resent me.
I remember you.
I recall you.
Yeah.
We didn't hit it off.
How are you?
I'm fine.
Oh, no.
Yeah?
Yeah, it was.
It's great.  I swea-- I'm-- I'm, tch, I'm speechless.  I was...I was not in the mood to listen to this thing now.  I don't know what to say.  I'm moved and I laughed and I-- Uh, I, you know, I was on the edge of my seat.  I just think it's wonderful! I'm, I'm totally...stunned.  This is not an insult.  I'm amazed that you can...  It was-- I just thought it was great.
Yes!  I was abso-- And...w- what...made you think of that climax scene where the, where the... architect is walking home with his actress girlfriend and-and the ex- wife who's schizophrenic jumps out of the bushes and stabs him to death?
Well, it was just fabulous!  I'm, I, you know...
I thought it was wonder-- There's maybe one or two things in there that I would do differently myself, but...
...but who cares?  It was just--  It was fabulous.
Fabulous, I mean it!  I'm so impressed.
God.
Tell me about your trip... what did you <u>bring</u> me...?
You tol me you wuunt ask me again til I'm ready....
I'm not.
You spend the afternoon in Bed?
You take this much time over everything?
OHFORGODSAKE, get ON with it.
We have a memo here, from your friend Mr. Krendler at the Justice Department.
He requests your presence, once again, as part of...
You want to <u>hold</u> him...?
'bout time you <u>learned</u>...
I wonder no longer.  You were out of the country.
I <u>sense</u>...  The faintest <u>whiff</u> of a perfume, whose <u>base</u>, whose <u>base</u>, whose <u>base</u> is "Hamamelis" ... it is <u>witch-hazel</u>--such a clean scent.  No, not a European scent. I would say it is a scent of the New World.  I would say, you have been in America.  Have I struck home?
...you have <u>brought</u> this perfume... brought this perfume.  Back.  <u>Back</u> from America.  To your New Wife...  You have given it to her, and some of...  Some of 'her perfume' has found its way back onto you.  Lucky man.  Lucky man, indeed.
They <u>will</u>, sir.  We <u>train</u> them, to the figurine, <u>eventually</u>, they consume a man, say, 80 kilos, say, in...
...we were speaking of my <u>father</u>...
...and my need for The Institution...
And how did he do that?
I'm afraid, this wine is making me woozy...
...not to turn around.
Oh, my <u>program</u>...
I can't remember.  I've got to make some money.
...yes, yes, yes....
Isn't it funny?  You can look on my face  which you would grant me, is the most hideous sight you will see in what I hope is a long life. You can look at me.  Which shows  a Strength which <u>must</u> come from strong  strong convictions.   But you <u>shy</u> when I say the name of God.
I just wanted to know if you've seen this.
It's about time. Isn't Fun great?
Stop, stop...I'm willing to put my mouth where my mouth is...I throw one overhand pass and Todd catches it-- dramatic pause--You let me go down on you...
Thanks a lot. Seriously though, by winning this bet, you will prove to the world that you indeed know everything.  Isn't the rush of gambling on your cynical philosophy of life enough?
Clever observation. Go back to Wichita.  Oh that's right, you can't.
So what?                                                    ]
About ten years a--why...Don't look at these...Come on...Stop.
Thank you, my love.                                         ]
Ronnie!
All right.
Shut up, it is. I told Dennis if he gave me another topic that was political, I'd spew burrito chunks.
You goddamn bitch!
Very very. The photographs?
People love you but I know you. Jennifer Forbes told me the petition she signed was to put a jacuzzi in the cafeteria. And Doug Hylton...
Don't talk to me like that.
No.
Mourning. Maybe watch some T.V. Why?
Hea<u>ther</u>, I've got something going with J.D.
S'okay....
No shit, sherlock. I can't believe it. I just killed my best friend.
Same difference. Oh jesus, I'm gonna...
French.
I did not want them <u>dead</u>.
Did not.
Did not.
I was thinking more along the lines of slitting Heather Duke's wrists open and making it look like a suicide.
You're not listening. People are going to look at the ashes of Westerburg and say there's a school that self-destructed not because society didn't care, but because that school <u>was</u> society. Is that deep or what? I'll let you put it in your diary, babe. Free of charge.
Just push the red button twice. That's what stops it. If that's what you want, babe?
What?
May<u>be</u>.
Oh, I was scared of the same thing, Heather. The minute you try to deal with the actual teenagers who have contemplated suicide you're stepping into quicksand. Quicksand filled with bad complexions, bad grades, bad parents, bad drugs, and all sorts of doody nobody wants to hear let alone bend down to clean up.
frowns at Henry.
From now on, you're sleeping in the house, where we can keep an eye on you.
and HERBERT exchange a glance. HONORA smiles at Juliet.
Well, actually, Mummy's left that programme now . . she's far too busy with The Marriage Guidance Council.
It doesn't matter.
It's so beautiful!
Don't worry, Gina! Mummy and Daddy love each other.
You came in for your EEG. You fell asleep and well, I took the liberty of...I'm sorry. You looked like a wreck Trevor.
Okay Mr. Statistics I've got one for you. What's the most common cause of death for adults over the age of eighteen?
Second most common?
Eighty third most common.
You just made that up.
Yeah, how's that?
Really? Do tell.
I saw her drowning inside the car, detective.
But... I thought...
Yes. Now go back to sleep. You're driving the rest of the way to gramma's remember?
Well they'd have to prove it in a court of law for one thing-
You probably don't remember the night we played. Your first year as husband and wife.
Whew. You bounce right back don't you?
I... think we need to talk, there's something really strange going on...
Come on, quit fucking around. Listen it's about... what we did together last night.
Huh?  Whadda you mean?
I don't need to be a hero, LaPlante, but I can't face people... the looks in their eyes... after the trust they gave me!
It was you!  I thought I heard...
Allen?  He... he's okay?
So you can call me "naive," Mister LaPlante.
I read the probation report.  It's not good.  I think you're going... going to prison, Mister... Bernie. I know that scares you but..
DON'T SAY "BILL," BERNIE!  DON'T SAY ONE WORD!  DIDN'T I SAY "ONE WORD AND YOU'RE FIRED?"
YOU KNOW WHY?  BECAUSE IT'LL BE AN <u>EXCUSE</u>!  IT'LL BE "BERNIE LAPLANTE EXCUSE NUMBER FOUR THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND SIX."  NO, FOUR THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND TWELVE.  THAT'S HOW MANY EXCUSES YOU HAVE GIVEN ME, I KEEP TRACK OF THEM ELECTRONICALLY. I HEARD THEM ALL, BERNIE.
THAT'S IT!  YOU TALKED!  YOU'RE FIRED!  OUTTA HERE!  GET OUTTA HERE!
OUT!  I TOLDJA.  JESUS CHRIST, I GOT CUSTOMERS WAITING!  AN' YOU WERE GONNA GO OUT LIKE THAT?  AN' MEET THE PUBLIC IN STOCKING-FUCKING-FEET?
I DON'T CARE ABOUT <u>YOUR</u> PROBLEMS, I'M GONNA THINK ABOUT <u>MY</u> PROBLEMS. <u>YOU'RE</u> ONE A MY PROBLEMS.  GET OUT! OUT!  OUT!
Sometimes.  His name's Elliot.  He saved a guy's life one time.  In a fire.
"The Nomm"?  What's that?
Were you in it?  In the war?
What picture?
John, I'm sure she could support just about anything.  I think I'll see you to your room. A sort of bodyguard.  Make sure no harm comes to you.
No, John, you're too hard on yourself.  I've got the creep here, the guy who's...
You said all the passengers were accounted for...
Quit?  She wants to quit?
You didn't?
How are they with kids?
So this really does the trick, eh?
Oh, fine.  She's gone away for a little while and when she comes back I've sort of resolved to really tell her how much I care for her.
I am.  I'm really feeling pretty good.  I have a much stronger sense of how far I've come.
Well, we talked about the whole disapproval thing.
I understand that.
No, no, no, no.
That would be stupid.
-- a sense of proportion.
I think we should talk first.
It's okay, baby, the police are coming.
Mom, <u>there's somebody in the</u> <u>house</u>!
Mom, I heard someone downstairs!
No.
Yeah -- she did a good job.  This glass looks brand-new.
I'm having the floor fixed,
Philip, what are <u>you</u> doing here?
Do you have enough money?
-- A man.
Not now.  I'm busy.
Interrogation's over, Bedsoe.
Cut him loose.  The D.A. says you ain't got shit on this guy.
It's circumstantial.
Maybe he was a lousy shot.
That's all?
No.  What am I to do?
I lied.
It's mine.  It's been in my family for years.  It belonged to my great, great, great grandmother.
Why?
It will end tonight.
He will not stop until it is over.
I like my work.
We'll see.
Me too.
Good afternoon...  ... Shirley.
No.  The money, please.
I can take care of myself.
Maybe Glen already picked up the disks.
I have contacts in Los Angeles.  Lawyers and judges who can help you.
Are you totally stupid?  What does it look like?
We had an awful lot of shooting.  You need a doctor in there?
Only if you try to grab me.  We could've shot you from the wall.
Find something:  Extension cords, rope, wire--we'll have to tie them tight.
You fucked up, Glen.
First my girls.  I get my girls, you get the other disk.
You go, Thomas.  You get out, and I'll stay with Daddy.
Go!  If you get out, maybe you can help the police!
Mars?  What are you doing?
Just one question.  Please.
Go, Chief.
I know the one.
And now I'm taking it back.  We're getting Smith out of the house.
Not until the man calls.
They've been in there all day.
Try Al.  See if you can open Al.
We want them.  You will not let anyone go into that house--or anything come out-- until my people recover these disks.
You will re-assume command.  In two hours, a group of my people will arrive at York Estates.  You will tell the Sheriffs that they are an FBI tactical team.
Of course.
How many in your family?
Their people?
I admire you, General. How do you keep command of your men amidst such madness?
I wish I were like you. Look at my staff, they won't work, they listen to no one.
How so.
I am on a list! What list?
What is it?
Please, except my humblest apologies...
That will take time.
Move? Where to?
The third floor are low class rooms.
Pack the bags, we have to move.
Jean Baptiste!
No answer. Please send someone to get them, please.
Go out! Where?
No, no.
You cannot go alone.
We are almost out of everything.
How dead?
I do not know, sir. I think they will kill us all.
You're the Doctor, sweetheart. 'Guess the atropine worked, then.
And what's Steven's status?
-- "oh, no, Officer, I'm very much alive -- just a joke to beat my husband at his own clever game -- What? What do you mean he's dead? It's all my fault, I may as well have killed him myself!"
-- the James Dean wannabe with the hair trigger --
So what stopped her?
-- there's already been way too many complications for a very simple plan. You ever find out what happened to Melissa Marr?
So we don't even know if she's alive or dead --
-- there's plenty: for all we know, Steven's got her spying on us right now --
-- the whole thing is falling apart!
Yeah...something.
Three times, to be exact.
Accidents. Fatal. Each of your prior wives, so we've been informed.
And I think that's case --
Did it work?
Over here!
I'm better than that.
-- listen to the man --
We're safe?
I hope not.
Sure it wasn't. Hey, anybody else here make their living with thrills'n'chills for the kiddies? Don't raise your hands all at once.
Really? Well, let it rip.
-- the sadistic prick --
Well, who's the damn thing <u>from</u>?
You didn't think to ask?
-- being utterly fucking useless, what else is new.
Alright, Mr. Pritchett, let me just sign the damn thing.
Very good. Well, I think I can say with complete honesty: I've never heard of any of you.
-- no more --
Why not?
Melissa...?
Melissa, it's Sara -- is that you?
Keep talking, I'll find you!
-- I'm coming --
Why don't you pass me your plate?
Well I bet you they're happy.
We're going to go someplace new.
We'll get it later.
That's great, honey.
Will, maybe we should have separate bedrooms for a while.
I just, I don't know...
Aubrey knows more about us than you think.
Were you fooling with the power?
Didn't you just see the power go off and on?  I just had a bulb break on me!
She's gone!
I'm ok.
White meat will be fine...
Come back to us honey, don't be afraid!
Did you remove anything in the cellar!
Not really.  Oh, wait a minute.
You wanted a story.  You got it.  Turn on the TV now.  And then get your ass down here ...  ...
It's nothing to do with me.  I wasn't even with him.
I'm trying to quit.
Maybe not.  But you know more than I do. You know something about this box. Something about a statue?
Woah.  Wait a minute.  Who?  The kid?
That you found.  What do you mean you found it?
No.  Really?
But how in God's name ...
Something like that.
Hudson, God's given you a gift for cat burglary, you can t just...
I read about these people in Newsweek.  Where's all the regulars, Crazy Jeff Cava, the Todd sisters, Indian Joe?  Where's Ed Kranepool's autograph?  Captain Bob's steering wheel?
Yes, master-thief, I can see that. You said something about a plan...
But I said I was sorry....
Don't act like you've never committed a crime before, Hawkins?  I know, I made call, when Anna tracked me down I...
I don't want to sound immature, but we were here first...
Close call, but she's our only way of keeping tabs on that damn mysterious Vatican organization. Hawk, it's time to go to the principal's office....
Fantastic.  Perfection.  The Vatican extends its jealousy to the lucky bidder.
Prison?
How long were you in?
Wow, you were "in the joint." "Doing hard time."  It's funny, but that excites me.  I seem to have a thing for sinners.
It's that kind of selfish attitude that...
You re not "some guy" anymore, Hudson.  Right now, you're the only guy.  Without your help, I....
Sure.  Face down.  Two endearing shots to the back of the head. That's your mark, man.  What did Little Eddie ever do to...
Surely a master-thief like you can tell the difference.
What job?
Two minutes, 35 seconds.  Damnit, I'm involved in this thing, so I just wanna know what this thing is. I wanna be treated as an adult.
Too bad.
Sharp.
With a little jazz.
The Hipster!
Yeah, I was all wet about your idea man... Well, thanks for being so generous... It is human, and you are divine... No, he's no faker. He's the 100% real McCoy beware-of- imitations genuine article: the guy is a real moron --
Mind if I join you?
Let me hold it, or you'll have a real shiner.
...I'm sorry.
Norville!
You're fools, both of you! It's obvious they're out to crucify Norville! They're trying to destroy him!
Forty-fourth floor, and it's very --
I --
Buzz... off! Ha-ha-ha-ha!
That must have been quite a disappointment, Mrs. Mussburger.
Get out of my sight.
-- So if you think it's appropriate, I'd like to bounce the idea off a few people at lunch --
...Her mother needs an operation...
No, Bennie: Lumbago.
I'm afraid so.
I don't know.  I prefer to think of her as a sleepwalker who can never be awakened -- feeling nothing, knowing nothing.
Mr. Holland?
I don't know.  He spoke to me last night on the boat. I liked him very much.
But she's not dead, Wes.
Please, Wes, do as I ask.  You must rest, you must sleep.
And charming?
Don't.  It will save you a great deal of trouble and other people a great  unhappiness.
She was beautiful.
Paul, we're not trying to blame Miss Connell.  It isn't a question of blame.  It's a question of what we are to do with Jessica.  The commissioner is very concerned.
Gotcha George, not a problem. Tomorrow. Hey, you want to start covering the old filmed entertainment sector yourself?
Overpriced bomb, cost over $6 million -- no stars, and no one's into the horror genre these days anyway. I'm advising the company recommend reducing positions there. It's disaster films that are gonna stay at the top.
Got a meeting uptown.
Up the organization!  Bastard.
Hmm. Good night.
Sure I do. Do I know what loneliness feels like? Sure I do. I know a lot about it, if that's what you mean.
All right.
Good.
Fine.
Hnnn.
Yeah.
Damn right, but where the hell were you?
Don't bullshit me around, Janey. Jesus Christ, I waited around for more than half an hour, in nothing but my boxer shorts, and -- and what's all that about? What the hell happened?
Yeah.
Sure is good shit. It's opiated. I had it in my chamber for a while. I was smoking this other --
Don't fret, Benjie, it's --
Sure. Maybe coffee.
Thanks for eating it. I don't know why I even pretend I can cook.
It's not like we're too busy.
I hope you changed the water in that bong from last night.
Groovy.  Young master of the revels, a treat for our hostess?
Yeah, well, you've been in love with like every other girl here, I was wondering when you'd get around to Libbets.
That's good, because I don't think Libbets is capable of the sex act.
My diagnosis is messed in the head. A poor little rich girl -- I mean check out the jeans and fur look. And lend your ears to this brutality. Like her mom and step dad and her step-sisters are going to Switzerland to ski over Thanksgiving break -- and like they didn't invite her!
They did it last year too. It's like traditional or something. They've got this humongoid Park Ave apartment and she just holes up there with a wad of cash.  Aren't the hugely wealthy sad?
Since he sleeps with every girl you ever show an interest in, why don't you just keep your Libbets thing a secret from him?
I don't know.
I don't know.
Hey Sandy, what were you blowing up out there? Your mom was pretty p.o.'d.
The ones you built?
I have to go to the bathroom.
Detective Dormer's not leaving for a few hours.
Maybe you could drive him to Spencer's.
Don't worry about him...
Then change it.
I don't remember.
No fibers, skin flakes, hairs...
One of the paperbacks we found in Kay Connell's knapsack.
When's that, a week?  Two weeks?...  We have to figure out a plan of action now.
To do nothing.
Dammit, Will.  Warfield had me locked up in his office again for five hours yesterday.  <i>Five</i> hours.  Asking all kinds of questions...
But he's zeroing in on <i>me</i>.  On <i>us</i>. Everyone's talking about it.
Well, I gotta tell you.  With a wife, three kids, and a pension plan in the balance, it's rattling hard.
Me and Hap.  A year and a half ago.  I knew the second I met Dobbs that he was guilty.  Smug, cold.  Dead eyes.  We had circumstantial evidence, but nothing to tie him to it.  Nothing concrete.  Went over every inch of that apartment.
Long as it's fun.
But you wanted to.
Drop the gun, Walter.
Listen to me.
What a pair we are. We deserve each other, don't we?
Oh, Lestat. I must do more than that. I've brought a present for you.
Tell me why...you've got to tell me...
And you never cried -
You are neither, Claudia. Now stop this --
No, you would not, Louis. Danger hold you to me.
Love?
I've come to answer your prayers. You want to die, don't you? Life has no meaning anymore, does it?
I want a woman.
Of course not. It's so easy you almost feel sorry for them.
I know. Let her alone.
Lestat, what do you mean?
You remember how I was, Louis.. the vampire Lestat...
He did it to make you stay with him!
What do you think she is, Madeleine? A doll?
Who? Who is here?
What are you doing in my closet?
Julie, you left four messages... Four.
He said he'd try. Try is like maybe. Try is nothing!
Work hard, huh? He's breaking your heart just because he can.  And I don't want to have to say I told you so...
Some.
We'll be better off in the open. If we stick together, maybe we can kill this creep for good.
Can't what?
Tyrell, you are an unstoppable force of nature.
What?
He's in it with Willis?
Rio, baby!
I said we start having fun. And that means now.
Make it three hundred. And throw that in, too.
You don't have to be a jerk.
This is General Nikolas Pherides, Commander of the Third Army. I'm Oliver Davis.  To be perfectly frank with you, we didn't expect to find anyone living here.
They used to believe that sort of thing in the mountain villages. Some still do --
I'll get Ida to make up your bed.
No one can take my father's place.
I was looking for you.
I don't know. As a child. I longed for a father and now - I don't know 
I wanted to be sure of something, General -- something that has always preyed on my mind. I have a horror of being buried alive and awakening to find myself shut in - entombed  imprisoned..
Because he was a brave man - because I liked him -- I came here to be sure.
It doesn't seem to bother you much, General.
Thea?
Not Theodosia. Theodosia's daughter -- your daughter.
Well, you're begging, and that's a whole lot worse.
I hate to do this, fella.
You've never been born. You don't exist. You haven't a care in the world.
What do you mean, I wasn't there? I remember distinctly . . .
Oh, I forgot. You haven't got your wings yet. Now look, I'll help you out. Concentrate. Begin to see something?
Thanks.
Joseph, now show him what happened today.
Oh, this afternoon. I thought I'd give the kids a treat.
Yeah  old Joe College Wainwright, they call me. Well, freshman, looks like you're going to make it after all.
Oh  Welch. That's what I get for praying.
Don't hurt my ear again!
Pretty much. You know, George, wish we could send Harry to college with you. Your mother and I talked it over half the night.
He's pretty young for that job.
Maybe you were born older, George.
I say, maybe you were born older. I suppose you've decided what you're going to do when you get out of college.
Still after that first million before you're thirty.
Aw, come on. Be a sport. Just dance with her one time and you'll give her the thrill of her life.
I'm not going to go, George. I changed my mind.
Yeah . . .  . . . you can take this one off now.
Would I?  You're not talking to somebody else around here, are you? You know, this is me, you remember me? George Bailey.
Well, what about the Building and Loan?
Well, Mr. Potter, I . . . I . . . I know I ought to jump at the chance, but I . . . I just . . . I wonder if it would be possible for you to give me twenty-four hours to think it over?
I'd like to do that.
All right, sir.
Hello. You look at me as if you didn't know me.
You've passed me on the street almost every day.
Uh-huh.
Gesundheit. This requires a little thought here.
I feel like a bootlegger's wife.  Look!
George, darling! Where have you been?
What the hell.  For you....
I think we're changing course a little.
We better go back in.
Shit.  Shit, shit, shit!
You bet.  Hang on....
I just made it up.  It means, "Get me out of there."  What the hell's that?
Abandoned?  It's a little early in the season for that.
If I had a $100,000 boat, I sure as hell wouldn't leave it anchored alone in the channel.
Please.  It's my job.
You stay right here.  You're going in with me.
Me neither.
All of us thank you, okay?
Come on, let's check the bite radius.
Bite radius.  You know, the size of the mouth?
The Shark's mouth.
Home it is.
For me?
Damn.
Going out.
10-4, in a few minutes.  He's down checking a buoy in the Bay Channel.
What for?
That's it?
10-4,   soon as I can raise him.
Affirmative, affirmative.  Turn the Kids day-sailing back to port.  I heard you.  Patrol out.
That's you.
Maybe.
What's that mean?
Anything?
I can go out if I want to.
Coming about, then.
What the hell is he doing?
Have you checked the bars?  The guy's irresponsible;  he's done this before.
Don't forget you have your brother.
See you later.
Nothing.
Yes?
... He ought to put him in here.
So tell Calvin.
Well, that's why you got it.
I want that shark, Kathryn.
Only to myself.
We're taking that shark alive!
I know it and I will not go down into this lagoon as long as you carry that!
Because I don't trust you, that's why.
The water ski show!  We have to get them out!
Sure.  No problem.
No.  Of course not.  Don't listen to him.  He's - he's...  ... my brother.
Now what?
Don't you dare.
It's large enough...
He needs a haircut.
Sometimes my father puts me in his lap and lets me steer the Jeep.
Nowhere....
We don't have anything straightened out.  You're uptight about something ...what's wrong?
I like it.  Really....
You have something to say about everything....
You check it....
I'm still five....
You guys must be starving....
Good.  So will I....
I don't want to talk about that.
I'm tired of hearing about it. There's no shark.  Sean wasn't killed by the same shark.. Dad didn't die because of it...It's all wrong... Some fantasy you've concocted...You keep bringing it up.
It could have been an accident....
I'm not saying you're wrong, just that there are other possibilities....
A big one....
Give me a hand here for Christ's sake....
A shark attacked Thea and some kids...She's going after it....
The world would be a better place if more sons danced with their mothers.
She's a tough lady....
She's had a lot to deal with...She needs time....
Oh, boy....
May your sex life be as busy as your shirt....
As the sun slowly sets in the West, we bid a fond farewell to the family of conch....
Half the pilots down here fly drugs ...He's always going off....
I am...You must know something about him....
I hear he flies a lot of private charters....
I've got to get to her....
I'm training to....
I'd have to manage a nookie parlor to do that....
You heard. Look for the knife.
Since when did you drink diet soda?
Why don't you dump the "Fat Lady?"
O.K. and I'm not in love with this fukker? That's how I feel about him.
What does it matter what I bel- ieve? .. What you gotta worry about is what Citrine believes ..
I'm asking it.
Bits.
I'm not telling you what to do. What I will say, is <u>right</u> <u>now</u>, that child's tricycle there is more important to me than this ..
I think he would have if he could have - been trying to get me up here long enough - I think he may have bribed the old guy to retire ..
I'm afraid I can't give you an ans- wer to that, Mr Goodridge. As I ex- plained to your secretary, we're do- ing a lotta looking, but we're not even sure it's her we're lookin for ..
I was hopin since we spoke that you might have remembered something that would give us an idea where she is?
No, just a minute or two .. I knocked on your door - no one home, so I followed the music ..
No problem. I'm not in a hurry.
How d'you know what I'm like?
Really? What did he say?
He said that? What else did he say?
Which is what?
I don't want them to arrest you.
Don't mix very well with beer.
He's not that bad of a guy ..?
Whatta you mean, "horrible?"
Don't worry about it -- I never told you what I thought of that memo either --
You lost your head, it happens.  I'm so fuckin jazzed!  Listen. I'm going to have to fly to Chicago tomorrow, how 'bout if we meet in the Dallas airport and we all fly into New York together for the draft?
No.
Bill, Rod, wait --
Give me your number.  I'll call tomorrow.  I'm just a little. I'm a little insane right now.  But it's going to be great.
Hi.
Mission... statement...
What?
Why do you love me?
Dotty -- this is not "guy.". This is a "syndrome."  It's called Early Midlife, About-To-Marry, Hanging Onto The-Bottom-Rung Dear- God-Don't-Let-Me-Be-Alone, I'll- Call-My-Newly Long-suffering- Assistant-Without Medical-For- Company Syndrome.  And if, knowing all that, you still allow him to come over, more power to you.
Ten seconds, Rod.
Now you want Arizona dollars.
You feel bad you tested positive? Quit doing blow!  You feel bad about your baby girl? Why did you leave the mother?
Huh?
Fine.
No.
What --
Damn right, and you can start by taking Rod's poster and putting it where people can see it!
I know.  It sucks.  I suck.
We'll go to the zoo sometime. Okay? I think I might have some time on my hands.
He's smart, Dr. Grant. And he knows so much about dinosaurs.
Don't worry, honey. We'll circle around and come back.
He's this way.
You couldn't have made that jump.
How would you have helped Eric?  He needs you, Paul. He needs us.
But he didn't. And neither did you. And I'm glad about that.
Just hold on.
It's a rapid prototyper. I feed in the scan data from the raptor skull, than the computer breaks it into thousands of slices which this thing prints, one layer on top of the other. It's the future of paleontology.
Alan, I want to tell you that I'm so sorry about the...
A well-accepted theory.
Then we go home?
Now, for our wedding anniversary this year we wanted to do something really special, something...
It's no use, Dr. Grant. No use.
Like if you shoot yourself in the foot?  Wouldn't matter.  You'd be dead  before you realized you'd accidentally pulled the trigger.
You gotta be kidding.  You dragged me out of Greenpeace to be a corporate stooge?  You couldn't get anybody else?
Because you said so.  Maybe nobody else believed you, but I always did.
I once saw a bull elephant die charging a jeep.  All the jeep had done was startle the bull's calves. I saw a lioness carry wounded prey four and a half miles, all the way back to its den, just to teach its cubs how to finish off a kill.
Rex won't be any different.  It'll come.
It's just fed.  It won't attack unless it's threatened.  Don't move.
You can't stay, Kelly, that's it. It's too dangerous.
Look!  Sarah!
Funded by whom?
Oh, no!
Move where?  Our boat's not coming for two days, your airlift is waiting for an order you have no way to send --
What now?
Find Nedry!  Check the vending machines!
Remember - - viable embryos.  They're no use to us if they don't survive.
I'll catch up with you.  You can go with the others.
John....
The - - agility.  You're right!
- - the undigested state of the berries because it's - -
They're not here.
No?  Non-linear equations?  Strange attractions?  Dr. Sattler, I refuse to believe that you are not familiar with the concept of attraction!
- - shut up.
Relax Donald, relax.  They're scientists.  They ought to be curious.
That's okay.  Listen, give me your hand.
Tim, you're gonna have to let go.  I'm going to count to three.
The kids okay?
Kids get scared.
I didn't say I was scared.
I know.
Wu?
It's safe.
Go  that's the way we're going to go.  What do you say?
Timmy!  The power is coming down, quick!
Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they didn't stop to think if they should.  Science can create pesticides, but it can't tell us not to use them.  Science can make a nuclear reactor, but it can't tell us not to build it!
Hold on - - this is no species that was obliterated by deforestation or the building of a dam.  Dinosaurs had their shot.  Nature selected them for extinction.
There's nothing that great about discovery.  What's so great about discovery?  It's a violent, penetrative act that scars what it explores.  What you call discovery I call the rape of the natural world!
Turn it off, Lex!  Turn it off!
Ken, it's Bruce. Listen, we've got a nibble on the Pendleton financing.
Mister Biller... now that we can see the lake, I think we should follow the shoreline to --
Fuck you.
It's all right.  Now... we're going to need a really good head-doctor for this. Someone who can get up on the stand and tell the jury that our client is mentally insane and has been for years...  We'll go through a dozen doctors before we find one who's willing to testify for us.
So?
He was a child killer in the late sixties... in a town called Springwood about eight miles from here.  Guess what his murder weapon was? A glove with six-inch blades.
Now.... according to the file, Krueger was burned to death in a fire in 1968. But get this -- beginning in 1984, there was _another_ series of murders in Springwood. All teenagers... all killed in their sleep... all killed with finger blades just like Krueger's.
Except this victim got away. I wonder if --
Up there.
I don't know what you could have read.
-- In magazines nobody reads.
Did you?
I gave it to him yesterday.
No, I left it in his office.
I've never seen him.  I don't believe there is a keeper of the files.
He has it, he just hasn't noticed it yet, all right?
I know.
Why would you suppose so?
One of you must be mistaken.
You won't have any trouble finding it.
Now you're saying Eduard was lured there?
I've heard of it happening.
Usually.
That's been noted.  But where does it lead us?  Unless you have something more to add.
-- Oh, yes, it's mad.
On the contrary, it matters a great deal.  We're engaged in immensely important research here.  I'm a revolutionary too, you know -- but a much more pragmatic one.
She went to the roof to sunbathe one lunch hour -- we watched her changing.
You're outta your depth here, Miss Darrow!
Does this look like the "Queen Mary"?? We don't take passengers! Full steam ahead, Captain Engelhorn!
All in due course, Ann. Our first responsibility is to get these artifacts safely back to London.
Sun's coming up ...  We've been in the fog for six hours.
Well, that was a monumental waste of time! I pay good money, only to be taken on some wild goose chase!  I made the mistake of trusting my idiot translator!
That's your monkey, Denham.
Yeah.
Don't belong?
Sorry. 
You think people hate you.
Didn't want you.
My name's John Klute.
I'm an investigator. I'd like to ask you some questions about Tom Grunemann.
Look, I'm sure this'll amuse you too. Ilia trying to get away from all that.
You said you wanted these.
Why?
What if i go out on tricks - you wanna come along? You could sit and read the National Geographic.
I don't get you.
I told you before, you wouldn't understand.
No.
Arlyn was a junkie; I'm not on junk!
You get the Christ out! You dumb stupid bastard, you don't know anything, you square, you get out! I don't have to show you anything; you get out!
Those were police laboratory people, they've been over the apartment.
I believed her, Pete.
I've just got a few --
Yeah.
He's in his room, playing.
Soon.  Very soon.
Uh huh...
C'mon, there's not much difference--
Tough shit.  You're stuck with me.
Sure.
Why does he decide?
Like a principal?
I don't understand, daddy.
Where will my bed be, where will I sleep?
Where will my toys be?
Who will read me my stories?
Daddy, what if The Face comes when I'm at mommy's?
Will you come and say good-night to me every night?
How long do you plan to live in New York, Mrs. Kramer?
Thank you.  I have no further questions.
Ted, I'm leaving you.
He is...  You sat in that coffee shop across from school--
You've been living here, in the city?
You want what?!
Are you out of your mind?! You're the one that walked out on him, remember?
Joanna, I don't give a--
Such as?
You want to know the real kicker?  The real kicker is, for the first time in my life-- the first time--I feel like a loser.
He wanted to know if I liked fried chicken.
I know....I know.
No.  Uh, uh.  Tell him I asked for it Friday.  I want it Friday. Period.
Fine.
Ted?  Are you there?
Any prospects?
How the hell are you going to do that?
I don't know, Thel...This whole thing has happened so...Pow, like that.
I'm gonna keep him, why?
Thelma, I've lost my wife, I'm not losing my child.
Maybe.  I said maybe.  What I mean is, ah...I don't think it'll really work out, but Charley seems to want it, so...
I know.
I have.
If I were to go into exile, could we expect any serious assistance, from India, suppose?
I am him.
I shall send a letter to America, to the President, informing him of our problem.
The Communists put their guns in the hands of the Khamba children and force the child to kill the parent. They have dropped bombs on the monastery of Lithang in Kham. It has been destroyed. Women and children, trying to escape from the fighting, have been shot with machine guns, fired from airplanes.
You have a lot to learn about organization. How to draw out people's opinions. How to make key decisions. Train your young Tibetans. When I make contact with you, I want to reach you through a Tibetan.
You can only go with attendants and a big ceremony.
You cannot.
But you are not a shepherd, you are the Dalai Lama.
I would not know. Maybe.
How could I ever leave?
My department doesn't have any record of that, Mrs. Bickerman.
He's not gonna hurt <u>me</u>.
And you like me.
Deep down, gut check.  I'm growing fond of <u>you</u> and it's liberating to say so.
Obviously some asshole in Hong Kong flushed him down a toilet.
'Cause he just ate a cow, you stupid--
Yeah and every time we think there's no more danger--
I'm a civilian!  You don't have any authority--
Jack Wells.  A museum sent you?
Adult males will charge hatchlings. If there's one out there...
Because they just consult their little indigenous charts.
I thought I might track the shoreline tomorrow, look for prints.
Ssssh!
I heard something.
Keep firing!
Yeah, I thought about that as I was driving... and... I haven't found somebody in my world.  You found anyone in yours?
So I was thinking... maybe if I met anybody in <u>my</u> world who was good for <u>you</u> and if you know somebody in New York good for me, we could fix each other up.
Worth a try.  We don't wanna be alone forever, do we?
Other than to eat us?
Lightweight Forward Area air device unit.  Whatever's out there, one shot with this and he's dead.
It's to make you <u>understand</u> him, with understanding comes tolerance. Too bad they don't put proverbs in Twinkies, my load would be lighter.
I'm sorry.
What?
I know and I thought I could handle it but work and pleasure along with somebody else, it's a dangerous mix.
The somebody else part?
Else.
Thanks, Ardelia.
Sometimes.
Sir, doesn't this "William Rubin" strike you as - I don't know - kind of vague?
Thanks.
He's a white male... Serial killers tend to hunt within their own ethnic group. And he's not a drifter - he's got his own house, somewhere. Not an apartment.
What he does with them - takes privacy... Time, tools... He's in his 30's or 40's - he's got real physical strength, but combined with an older man's self-control. He's cautious, precise, never impulsive... This won't end in suicide, like they often do.
He's got a real taste for it now. And he's getting better at his work.
Like I have a "knack" for Dr. Lecter?
Good idea. Meantime, try to get a feel for Catherine Martin. Her apartment, her friends... how he might've stalked her. I'm going to the other two clinics, Minnesota and Ohio.  Now's the hardest part, Starling. Use your anger, don't let it keep you from thinking. Just keep your eyes on Catherine. We've got less than 30 hours.
They'll use their best men. But they better be paying attention...
I think so.
Sometimes you do.
That is both impudent and untrue... Tell me, how did you feel when you viewed our Billy's latest effort?  Or should I say, his "next-to-latest"?
Life's too slippery for books, Clarice. Typhoid and swans came from the same God.  Tell me, Miss West Virginia - was she a large girl?
Big through the hips. Roomy.
Mmm. And what else...?
Was it a butterfly?
I'm waiting for your offer, Clarice. Enchant me.
Got dressed without turning on the light. I went downstairs... outside...
That's a childish, bullying stunt, Mr. Crawford. I was a battlefield surgeon, so you can put away your picture.
We leave in the morning?!
I won't sleep tonight. What an adventure!  I absolutely cannot wait to return to Portman Square, having laid eyes upon the full-blooded, red men in the wild!
Top of this ridge. Fort and Lake George are downhill of it.
I have nothing to go back for.
Duncan...  Duncan, I promised you an answer. You have complimented me with your persistence and patience... But the decision I've come to is I'd rather make the gravest of mistakes than surrender my own judgment.
Do not let gratitude get in the way...
Tradin' your skins in Castleton?
It was a war party. It means they're on the attack up and down the frontier.
Webb's at Edward?
Only twelve miles away! He could be here day after tomorrow.  Find your man, sir! Captain Beams will give you the message.
Sir!
Atten-hut!
Yes.
My master owns these lands and your father has been ordered to drive off the English squatters. They have consented to go. So now he calls them enemies no longer.
But so many suns have set since Le Renard struck the war post. Is he not tired?
That Le Renard has the power to lead his people into the light, I know well.
These observers were doing something. A test...I think they sank that ship on purpose to cover up their mistakes.
The good doctor hasn't showed yet.
No.
After a month of it you'd think I'd be used to it.
Where's Jones?
What's your air reading?
Twenty minutes!...Who had tank duty?
What you don't understand is that my crew is in jeopardy.
I'm not anxious to find out, either.
Do it.
The man is unbelievable... I say, leave him in there.
Shhhh...don't tell no one.  Job security.
What game, Cobb?...I'm on my way to Nirvana...
I'm on the way to the looney bin?  Hey, man, I'm not the dude sun bathing in his clothes.
Probably the plumbing.  You gonna make me finish that puzzle by myself, or what?
"Debbie Does Dallas"...  Hell, it's in Russian.  I can't read it...
Don't fuckin' worry, I ain't.
Seven hundred for the pair.
And nobody wants to live next door to the people that we live next to; a bit anti-social, you know.
Apart from those shotguns.
Don't play innocent with me Bazza; spanking!
I won't be seeing you again Chris; I have paid him every last penny.
That was Hatchet Horrible Harry.
We're in the spite. They were his fucking guns that we sold; we gotta find 'em.
I didn't touch him, he just passed out.
Invitations?
Well we have got about a hundred thousand pretty pieces of paper with the Queen on it. Will that do?
Samoan Jo's? Yon mean the pub? Hold on . . .
I don't know, but what I do know is that there's no more Harry, which means there's no more debt, and if there's no more debt there's no more problem, and there's no more problem with our neighbours because they are all dead. I think, if I get this right, we haven't done anything wrong anyway, which means we are in the clear.
What do you mean, me?
For half a million?
And still got a sense of humour. That's not monkey nuts son; you can still fold.  OK, before I loan you this, I expect, if you lose of course, my money back within a week, Crystal? That's Sunday, OK?
I got contacts. Listen Tom, if you pointed them at me I'd shit myself or do whatever you said to do. Either way you still get the desired effect.
Seven hundred each.
Hold on, give us half a chance to count it.
Oh, come on, Amado--
Leave your sister out of it.
I'm sorry, Sergeant Major. There wasn't anything I could do. Shadow gets crazy--
Colt Peacemaker.
He swore by it.  What?
So is Buddy on your short list?
You got to investigate. No question about it.
Yeah, it's a pretty cold trail.
I been here with him eight years now. He built it when he was with Leora.
There was a bunch of 'em You never met. Me neither.
I thought we already had this out? Next year, if your grades are high enough--
How many B-average students do you think they take at West Point?
He can't hear with that rig on-- Mikey!
Old bullets.  He uhm-- makes art with them.
So tell me why I shouldn't make this place off-limits.
I assume a lot of your business is from our people.
Mercedes Gonzales Ruiz.
Better late than never. Korean War hero, Sheriff for near thirty years-- Buddy Deeds Memorial P--
We don't need a new jail.
We're already renting cells to the Feds for their overflow--
I told the story enough times--hell, we were just in the car, he was stewing about the fight with Buddy while we drove over to Roderick Bledsoe's--
He owned the colored roadhouse before Big O--
No. I think his widow's still in their place in Darktown, though.  You think it's Charley Wade, huh?
It wouldn't happen to be your construction company gonna get the bid on building this thing, would it, H.L. And Jorge, you wouldn't be thinking about a couple dozen new jobs to dangle in front of the voters--
That was the night he disappeared?
And when my father was Sheriff?
What was your deal with him?
I'm surprised he bothered with it.
So I've heard--
Well, you were working there--
Got divorced, I wasn't gonna work for my father-in-law anymore. The fellas down here said they'd back me--
I got to admit it's not what I thought it'd be. Back When Buddy had it-- hell, I'm just a jailer. Run a 60- room hotel with bars on the windows.
You've got your mother, your kids--
Yeah--
What's up?
I haven't seen anybody come by.
Yeah. It's quiet--
Sure.
You haven't paid the cab.  He won't give us your bags 'til you pay him.
Thirty-five bucks.
I'm out of here, man!  Are you coming?
He won't.
He's with us... He's with us...
Sure.
I told you --
No.
I wasn't.
I was grateful to him.  I owed him my life.  And he loved me. He couldn't always show it, but he felt it.
Harry...
The usual.  Full house. Standing ovation.  I tell them it's magic...
Yeah.  Remember Quaid?
Somebody killed him.
I just saw him.
Just tell me about Swann.  Or are you too scared?
I'm afraid she's not in.
Too late.  Why are you here? Did you cone... up here for a reading?
Illusionists get. Las Vegas contracts, D'Amour.  Magicians get burned.
He deserved it.
I did it for Dorothea.
Now that I'm dead, the spotlight's off her.
You didn't try hard enough.
I should have been honest with you, right from the start.  I wasn't born to show people the error of their ways.  I was born to murder the world.
I know, it's stupid.
I think he kind of liked me...Is that so hard to imagine?
How'd a Japanese guy get a name like Hans?
I don't know, I think maybe I broke it? I knocked into something the other day...
Tomorrow.
That's what you said the other night.
Well, that's good, I have to get the kids off for school.  Can I call you in a little while?
Ok, well... I love you.
Good-night.
Good...I'm tired.
But I like to... and I don't smoke that much.
Ok, I will... later.
We're here for the week. I'm shooting in Osaka for a few days.
Have you met Charlotte? My wife.
No.  Of course not.  Mmmm.  Anago.  My favorite.
So you're going to kill her?  Put the gun down Claire.
My secretary?
No, I wasn't, actually.
You ready?
Miette, come here and relax.
I think you gave me the wrong one.
It was blank.  Nothing on it.  You gave me the wrong one.
I looked at the coroner's report.  My father's O positive and my mother...A negative.
So...then the coroner's report is probably wrong.  I mean...this is ridiculous.  There's been a mistake.  I don't believe any of this.
That can't be right.  My birthday's tomorrow.
And his message was  "Together, no matter what?"
Nothing you couldn't find out from reading the papers.  And you're already wrong on one count.
Really?  You know, seeing these guys away from the court, the facade slips. You catch things.
Nothing.
Whenever you lose, you get this attitude. But it's just a game.
The blue.
Really?  Well, come on, then.
Then I'll get you some punch.
No.
Always on my ass, anyway.
Just cause I don't kiss her booty like you...
Hey, don't take it personal.  And don't think just cause we play the same position we have to compete with each other.  We're teammates, okay?
Besides.  I've been starting point the last two years.  Ain't no way some dumb- ass freshman is taking my spot.
I'ma be in the NBA.  You're gonna be my cheerleader.
She's a ho cause she's sending her coochie through the mail.
And?  She's not saying, "I think you're a nice guy and I wanna get to know you better," she's saying, "I wanna bone."
Yeah, an honest tramp-ass ho.  But I guess you'll stick your dick in anything.
I don't.
Who's Spalding?
What?
Plan to.
Fine...Maybe I'll come by later.
No, it looks good.  I mean, it's cool.
We need to talk.
What?  Oh, and, uh, don't say "shit."
We were just studying.
Okay.
I've been hearing you.
What mess?
What?
Tell me what?
I mean, it's not true, is it?
I'm fuckin' hammered, Burt.
ooohhhhhh no.
I'd like to talk to you.  Your boyfriend let me in, I just knocked on the door --
Ok. For one thing, we're gonna need to turn that music down so we can talk, ok?
What's that stand for?
You mind if I come in, check things?
Did we win or lose, I mean --?
I was listening --
-- and I'm through playin' games.
"The" cause of dullness in others --
-- and lemme tell you this: Samuel Johnson never had his life shit on and taken from him and his money stolen -- who took his life and his money?  His parents? His mommy and daddy?  Make him live this life like this -- "A man of genius" gets shit on as a child and that scars and it hurts and have you ever been hit by lighting? It hurts and it doesn't happen to everyone, it's an electrical charge that finds it's way across the universe and lands in your body and your head -- and as for "ruined but by himself," not if his parents take his friggin' life and his money and tell you to do this and do that and if you don't? well, what --
Don't do this, Don.
Frank Mackey.  That's your son?
So you sat it out, that's what you did?
...ok...
yeah.
THAT'S NOT MINE.
I'm sorry, Stanley.
Do you know the answer to this?
I think that she thinks I may have molested her.
No.  But I probably will get a call back.
I'll get it because I'm a good actress, Richard.
Earl asked me, Linda, please, Linda, I'm sorry -- Earl asked me --
Shut up -- shut up --
Stand up.
M'lady...?
My guards are useless!  Take her from me!
Making the key to the throne.
But -- what is he doing?
We have grown wiser with age.  Now we know that some problems cannot be settled with a sword.
Hell may be our destination, dear Porthos, but not this trip.
Come on...
He lures us to capture.
You can't drink with a friend you haven't seen in months?
Midnight!  Mon dieu!  Driving the youngsters hard, eh?
Another?  How many times have you saved his life in this year alone? Three?  Four?
I was feeling sorry for myself. Raoul is getting married, he proposed today!  I love that boy beyond all measure, I've spent everything I own to give him education and opportunity.  Now he has complete happiness, and I mope.
Perhaps not as much as you might imagine.  When tutors answered every question except those about who I was.  When I was imprisoned in a way no other man had ever been, I knew there was something different about me.  But a king...
There is... wrath... in me.  I have learned to hide it.  Those years in the cell, I dreamed that freedom would someday just happen, the way the mask happened.  Now I am free. And with each free breath I feel the growing desire to make someone suffer for all I lost.  Look at this, all this that for ten years I could not see!  What if I become a king -- a king no different from my brother?
What is its antidote?
Who came?
And you never knew why?
It shall be done, your Majesty.
Yes, your Majesty.
Eh?
... Two-thirty-seven.
Aramis!  I have been expecting you!  We are satisfied, that will do.
Listen, my darling... Raoul was a... a good friend.  And now he is dead and that is very sad but --
Did you report it stolen?
Right behind you.
And who are you?
I'm done talking until I get a lawyer.
Well it's just kind of a coincidence, isn't it?  Stanton and Fleming, both started in '83, both in area six...both in Vice?
Figure you would have tried it already.
Tubbs listen!  I don't know anywhere else to go!  I need your help!
It's...it's a long story.  Can we meet somewhere?
Please...
No thanks.  How do you know they can't catch you on this thing?
I knew I could count on you.
Hop in.
He may have an unconscious homosexual conflict. A fear of being gay. He objects to the word 'fairy.' Plus smeared bloodstains indicate that he put the shorts on Charles Leeds after he was dead.  I believe he did this to emphasize his lack of interest in Mr. Leeds.
Have him meet me with pictures of Lecktor's books...
Library of Congress.
Why don't you get Birmingham P.D. a methane probe out of D.C. and have them cover the backyard...  maybe the cat's dead and the kids buried it.
What if it encourages the Tooth Fairy to do something besides write?
We want the cans the Jacobi home movies came in.  They're in the far corner of the room under the windows.
He asked for Will. He said he might call back tonight. I tried to hold him... I'm sorry... He said 'tell Graham "broken mirrors."'
They had to shape up their employment practices to keep this defense contract.
Some remarkable events have happened in Birmingham and Atlanta.  Do you know what I'm talking about?
Yes...
No.
That's true.
Describe exactly what you think he did to Mrs. Leeds and I'll tell you if you're right or not.
Goodbye.
I love you...
You got a deal...
Huh?
Pretty well.
Yes.
I refuse.
Hi, Andy.  How's the weather up there?
Andy... it's me.  I've got some crummy news.  Taxi's been canceled.
Ehhh, you know those guys.  If he had his way, I'd be stuck in the hospital, running tests all day.  And anyway, I've found a new guy who's gonna be able to instantly remove the cancer.
Yeah!  He's a psychic surgeon in the Philippines, and he's amazing!  He rubs you and sucks the disease right out!
Twenty!
Deal.
Hey, I love movie theater popcorn... but that doesn't mean I have to sit through "On Golden Pond."
No!  YOU get in the kitchen.  I'm gonna make you dry my dishes!
You're a wimp.
Then your father's a wimp.
Yeah, exactly -- "was"!  But now, you're creatively bankrupt.  In fact, Ladies and Gentlemen, Kaufman's so desperate, he PAID me to do this tonight!!  I'm a plant. It's just a fresh coat of paint on an old broken-down routine.  Isn't that true???
Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I know!  Wink wink!  Nudge nudge!
I'll take my chances!!
Wow, you can't BUY this kind of publicity!
Why isn't he MOVING??
Oh shit.
I'm just doing my job.  You gimme that Juris-my-dick-tion and you can cram it up your ass.
All the time.  It's called mescaline and it is the only way to fly.
That's what you think.  They've promised to back me, Trinity. They're going to reinsert my body. I'll go back to sleep and when I wake up, I'll be fat and rich and I won't remember a goddamn thing. It's the American dream.
I need an exit!  Fast!
Hello, Neo.  Do you know who this is?
It's an honor.
More important than what is when?
You believe the year is 1997 when in fact it is much closer to 2197.  I can't say for certain what year it is because we honestly do not know.
Your mind makes it real.
Morpheus, I don't know --
I know.  You're Neo.  Be right with you.
Bingo.  Not quite what you were expecting, right?  I got to say I love seeing you non-believers. Always a pip.  Almost done.  Smell good, don't they?
I'd ask you to sit down, but you're not going to anyway.  And don't worry about the vase.
Right now, all I can tell you, is that you are in danger.  I brought you here to warn you.
They're watching you, Neo.
Please.  Just listen.  I know why you're here, Neo.  I know why you left your family and your friends, why you left your home to come to this city.  You're looking for him.
That the Matrix cannot tell you who you are.
That's different.
Are you worried?
No.
I'm going in after him.
I have to.
Morpheus did what he did because he believed that I'm something I'm not.
I'm not the One, Trinity.  The Oracle hit me with that too.
Hey, Mikey, he likes it!  Ready for more?
Tank, it's me.
Thanks.
All right!  Quiet!  For $40 I could give you...
Anybody wanna have a game?
Thanks for the ride.
No, she isn't.
You tell me that in front of these creeps?
He has about twenty-eight bucks... it's all he has on him.
Michael, nobody's out to screw you, I guarrantee that.
You're right.  You're right.  Look, I'm not gonna wind up paying his debts.  You know that.
'Amen I say to thee, thou wilt not come out from it until thou hast paid the last penny.'
No...his business is bad.  But I'll decide what to do and you...and you just keep out of anything that might...might...er draw attention to you.
Oh yeah, that's a possibility.
No...we can come back in a couple of weeks.  Besides, if we're both gone for three days it wouldn't look right.
For God's Sakes...I told you before...nothing.  Charlie, I can't stay in here too long at this hour...will you please listen to me?
Of course!  A double for Michael, Tony.
You think so?
I lay awake nights in a cold sweat, I want this party to be like some- thing Mom would have made for you, I want it to be perfect --
And you could care less --
Good.  Songs.  What songs should Sidney -- Pancho and his six men we can forget about -- what songs do you think he should play?
Okay.  All aboard - New York, New York!
You mean this, sir?
Bontecou wants a speedier response than that.
I'll make a note of it.  Anything else?
Oh, excuse me.  This is -- uh -- this is --
I thought this was practically a done deal --
Bontecou wants a quick response and --
Don't you want to hear the details?
So I am to understand from your re- sponse that you do not want to hear the details of Bontecou's offer?
Certainly, Bill.
Yeah.  Neat.
None facety, mistah.  You come for me?  Dat's good news.
Doctor?  What could be wrong wit' you?
It's so very nice to see you again.
You appear at his side out-of-the- blue, stay at his house, eat dinner with his family, it's practically a first.  You're in the red-hot center of big business and I thought you were a regular Joe.
Not the one I met this morning, hit- ting on me in as nice a way as I've been hit on in a long time, but the moment you find out I'm my Dad's daughter, you act like a stranger.
Not now.
Why don't you get off his case?
Maybe it's the draft through the door.
-- That was the place... and you were the guy.
I won't.
You're putting me on the spot, Bill.
What do you mean?
Can you keep a secret?
So can I.
Why didn't you stop me?
I'm sorry to hear that.
With you?!  Who is 'you'?  Did you tell her who you are?
Does she know where she's going?
'...Yes --'
It's enough now.
There's going to be plenty of time for that.
I think you know --
Yeah, I give a shit.
But we want you back, Bill.  Mean- while, enjoy your party, celebrate, we'll attend to the nasty details. And Mr. Black, may we say thank you.
Bravo.
I'm sorry.  But give it to me again. The short version.
Yeah, it's good to get together.
Raise away.
Well, remember how you told me about "lightning striking"?  The nature of it's in there somewhere.
Yes, but --
How 'bout another cup of coffee?
And I want to get into my apartment and go to work.  Please, what do you say, another cup of coffee?
I know about your fucking condition, Leonard! I probably know more about it than you do! You don't have a fucking clue about anything else!
No. Just leave the stuff lying around as if it were yours. Like you just took it off or something.
Just two. So far.         *
I don't want blood on them.
Strip!
Who is he? What have you got me into?
He'll kill you, Lenny.
Yeah?
This guy's dangerous, let's think of something else.
Can I ask you something?
Are you Teddy?
Did Teddy send you?
You're in a playful mood.
Think so? You don't know? Didn't you write it down?
Lenny, as a buddy, let me inform you. Your business here is very much finished. You're still here because of Natalie.
Why? Come on, Leonard, we talked about this. It's not safe f or you to be walking around like this.
Are you sure?
His name's James F. Grantz, John G. Check     * your tattoos.        *
There's three between Miami International and the glades.  I'm gonna try for her, but this is triage.  Protect the maximum number of lives.  You need to know that...
Yes you do...
No, you don't, Jim.  'Cause if I close this down, you got nothing to make a phone call about.  And my guys don't have a week for a Feeb bureaucratic process.  Every hour longer they're in there, they risk exposure.  So, right here, right now, they're back in or I pull them out and close you down.  What's it going to be?
You do business in Cuba with your husband?
Hola, viejo.
Sonny Burnett...this is my partner, Rico.
Mrs. Rico.  But don't worry.  She is safe.  To insure that, I am keeping her close to me.  It's always good to keep people your friends care about close to you.
"No, viejo.  That was Jos Yero, splattered all over his motherfucking wall."
On my way back...
Then you should.
I'm my <u>own</u> man.  And anytime you want to see how much man I am?
...what else, what else did he indicate to you?  I need to know everything he said.
What's it say?
Maritime.  Jose will fill you in.
You don't like us finding your load?  We can go and lose it all over again...
Lotta rich women back there...
Men, they mostly faggots.
Well, ain't no use hanging around here.
I got me two hundred twenty-four bucks of flat folding money...  He know what he can do with that chicken-shit day's pay. And if he ain't man enough to do it for himself, I be happy to oblige!
You gonna beat me, Joe?
Gay ends in Y. Fey. You like that -- gay fey -- is that your problem?
I'm inviting you. I mean if you're not located, I got a place. I'm inviting you, goddamit.
What's all this sweet talk about Florida? Your friend O'Daniel got a stable down there now?
Yeah, well, so?
What you're driving at, you want me to get lost so you can go to your fancy-ass party.
Don't say nothing about you either.
Well, what the hell, I got nothing better to do.
I been thinking. I hope we're not gonna have a lotta trouble about my name down there. Because like what's the whole point of this trip anyway?
I mean New York's one thing, but can you see this guy, imagine it, running around the goddam beach all suntan and he's going in swimming, like, and then somebody yells 'Hey, Ratso' -- how does that sound to you?
Sounds like crap, admit it. And I'm not gonna have it. I'm Rico all the time, okay, do you blame me? That's agreed, okay? We're gonna tell all these new people my name's Rico?
No sir, I'm no cowboy really, but I'm a first class stud.
You bet I do, sir.
Well, not too, I mean, a little.
Little fuckers are thieves, rapists, pickpockets, murderers, you name it - they do it. Don't trust any of 'em...
Ziat!
The Hilton.
Well, it's an interesting place...  Tell you the truth, I think the food is lousy. The crap they sell in these little restaurants. I went out to eat in one of them last night, and I had to run to the damn toilet... You shoulda' seen the toilet.
Something like that. Cigarette?
What did he do?
Billy!  Please!
Yeah.
You can't take anything seriously.
It's not important, just technical things. We make our case.  You were very good, you spoke well. The Judge like you. It look good. Don't worry.
Yeah...?
Weird shit...?
Look what you did! You stupid sonofa-
Third rail is dead.  Get me up.  There must be a manual override in the booth.
Scent glands.  Insects use 'em to identify themselves to each other.
Taking a cab instead of hiring a limo?
So?
Yeah, barely. We haven't found anything down here. Nothing...
Jump in.
Oh, right... They been here since noon. I told them you're real busy.
I always say if you can't enjoy your own company, you're not fit company for anyone else.
It shouldn't be too much longer.  Once the roads are open, the lines'll be up in no time. If you give me their numbers, I'll keep trying them for you.  Could I ask you a favor?  I noticed in your case there was a new Paul Sheldon book and...  and I wondered if maybe... 
If you wouldn't mind.
You'll never realize what a rare treat you've given me.
I know how that can be.
I don't know.
Great.
What? What happened to "I'll treasure whatever you do?"
I really value your criticism, but maybe you're being a little hasty here.
--not fair?
--cliff-hangers--
My secret is I only use fresh tomatoes, never canned. And to give it that little extra zip, I mix in some Spam with the ground beef.
Why would I run away? I'm a writer, Annie--it's all I am--and I've never written this well--even you said that this is my best, didn't you?
Well, this deputy would rather be home under the covers with the Sheriff.
I'm sure you know Paul's been going to the Silver Creek Lodge for years to finish his books.
Not quite. I just called, and they said he checked out five days ago. Isn't that a little strange?
I am. Well, maybe not completely--
Only because..it's spring..chalk it up  - to spring fever.
Good.  Biocyte stock is just a week or two away from going through the roof.
An outbreak of <i>Chimera.</i>
In downtown Sydney for a start.
Ninety-three point four million.
Exactly where is she?
No.  Should I?
No.  Just as if I'd like to.
Not tonight.  Bad timing.  Sorry -
Hi.  Would you mind slowing down?
This wasn't what I had in mind, Nyah.
Betting table twelve off the paddock. Nyah, are you up to this?
No.  You just looked as if you did.
We could lock down passport control and all ports of authority, but that won't stop Ambrose, and beyond him, we don't know who else we're looking for -- all terrorist bank accounts of which we're aware are stable.  No deposits, no withdrawals.  Therefore no suspects.
Do you?  Even assuming you're able to prevent Ambrose selling Chimera, you've now got an additional problem.  You destroyed all of Chimera at Biocyte.  If Ambrose is going to sell Chimera now, he'll have to do it by taking a pint or so of Miss Hall's blood to market.
But that leaves another seven or eight pints of Chimera.
Yes, I believe that's right.  Now my understanding is that 20 hours after exposure, the victim becomes infectious. Highly infectious.
That simple, huh?
Oh. Uh. Commencing diversion.  Alarm in cosmetics.
Yes, Anatoly, yes.
All ten million.
Take off your coat.
Take off your God damn coat!
Bastard!
Yeah.  I follow you.
You mean <u>I've</u> lost enough agents for one night.
Now I want you to hold onto it.
Because if you knew what you were getting into, you never would have done it.
Exactly, that's your job.  Tomorrow on the train, you can't let this list get out into the open.  What's the range of this thing?
I'll get you close.
We'll see.
Roger that.  Opening doors now.
Wonderful.  Ran into a convention of auto dealers at the Drake Hotel.  You hear the one about the astronaut who comes back from the first manned flight to Mars after two years?  His wife's got a year old kid.  So he says "All right.  Who was it?  My friend Harry?"  She says no. "Oh, it was my friend Sammy."  She says it wasn't Sammy.  "Oh, I suppose it was my friend Lou."  "No, what's the matter, don't you think I have any friends of my own?!"
I was sitting in a cafe waiting for you and suddenly there she was, standing in the rain just outside the safe house..alive and beautiful..and thinking Im dead and gone.  God knows what shes had to do forget about me to keep going and get the job done, I..
That's not so good for you, my friend.
Nobody. Loretta is getting married.
Johnny Cammareri. I think it's great and about time. What's she gonna do with the rest of her life she don't get married?
I like your dress.  It's very bright.
Yes.
I'm going to marry him.
Yes. Do you want...
Excuse me.
I don't understand.
All my life I have never reached a man. I knew that I would reach my husband, but I took my time and he was dead. Ronny.
I want to cut you open and crawl inside of you. I want you to swallow me.
Get all of me. Take everything.
You're mad at him, take it out on me, take your revenge on me! Take everything, leave nothing for him to marry! Hollow me out so there's nothing left but the skin over my bones. Suck me dry!
Come on.
Is Johnny here?
Good! We can get this out on the table.  I'm Ronny, Johnny's brother. 
You? No.
My mother is dying. When she is dead, I'll come back and we'll be married.
A week. Two weeks. No more.
How about a month from today?
Where? At the City Hall? No! I want the whole wedding or we will have Bad Luck. For a whole wedding to be planned, a date must be set.
A month from today?
I'll take care of it, Johnny. I'll take care of the whole thing. All you have to do is show up.
Good. When you love them they drive you crazy cause they know they can. But you like him?
And who's gonna pay for that?
Did you see it?
Oh.
You gotta date?
Where is she?
It's late.
Sure!
I am alone in the world.
Yes.
No.
No. I think the house is empty. I can't invite you in because I'm married and because I know who I am. You're shaking.
You're a little boy and you like to be bad.
I'm too old for you.
Good night.
WE NEVER SUSPECTED YOU!
Please!
I'm not interested.
Oh, please!
I am Arthur, King of the Britons.
What does it say?
What?
Bloody peasant! 
Come on, patsy.
Ask me the questions, Bridgekeeper.  I am not afraid.
My name is Sir Launcelot.
To find the Holy Grail.
Blue.
I will send help, brave friend, as soon as I have accomplished this most daring, desperate adventure in this genre.
Farewell, Concorde!
I'm ... your son ...
Yes.  It's not a very good name, is it?  But we are nice and we shall attend to your every ... every need!
The what?  But you are tired and you must rest awhile.  Midget! Crapper!
No, no, we must find the Grail.
Yes!  With a herring!  With a herring!  Cut down with a herring!
So, there are rules.  Things you do and things you don't do.
You don't tell Her Majesty how you feel.
Not down south you don't.
Aye.
Your Royal Highness.  What a pleasure to see you here.
I don't think I've had that pleasure.
Not now he doesn't.  This is my place.
My own.
Is that the Queen's request?
I wouldn't know.
What I do, I do for my Queen.
Maybe, once.
Why?
I do what I do.
Aye.
I said.  I serve the Queen.
It's a fine spot, ma'am.
Aye.  But there are Fenians reported on the mainland.
I'll decide when it's exaggerated.
Indeed, and for that they are eternally grateful.
In so many ways ... and yet it is your presence they crave.  A figurehead.
No, she wasn't.
What is he doing there?
I made no request to go out riding today.  How long has he been there?
They are demanding the dismissal of John Brown on grounds of drunkeness.
Sure.
What the hell does that mean?
Greg never came home.  A few hours is one thing, Nick, but this is different. Something's happened to him.
No way.
Okay.  We'll see what's up.  But if things are cool, I don't want to hear anything more about this.  Life's too short, know what I mean?
What?
Put in a quarter.
Yes it does.  Don't you see?  We have to play by the rules.  That's what it wants.
Yeah, that's what worries me.
I know.
I'm okay.
You have no time.  What is your question?
You have no time.
Fucked up.  That's what they said I was.
Interest?! There's six of the top actresses that want this thing.
That's good. They're allowed, but I don't like 'em...for obvious reasons. One man used to live here that had a prize fighting kangaroo. You wouldn't believe what that kangaroo did to this courtyard ... let's see your Aunt's apartment ... it's a good one.
Hi...do you work with my Aunt?
Diane?
But it said #12.
Just to see if there was an accident on Mulholland Drive.
Come on... let's find you something to wear.
I'm all right.
Gotta keep an eye on her, that's all.
Keep her from gettin' in trouble, that's all.
Unreal ... so, you're looking good. Whatcha doin' these days?
Making ends meet, huh.
Yeah, look at my digs ... times are tough.
It was just a thing. The story made you laugh.
Good. Nice to see you, Bruce. Johnny.
Give me a fucking.....
You didn't think about it did you ? I read your file. It said you had a nervous breakdown.
Know what ? That it was your fault ?
So was I. So don't give me any shit. Your business is just as bad. At least I'm up front about it. You kill people slowly. Your corporate take overs can decimate a families livelihood over a year sometimes two. Now you know how it feels.
It'll end. It'll end with him and McCay. Then the park shuts down. Permanently.
Not quite....
What the fuck are you talking about.
You've got it boss. One more mangled body to the East River, coming up !
I had suggested that they tone down the program so that the "guests" might take longer to expire.
But sir, most of the people we are putting into the "Park" are accountants that embezzle or investment bankers. They are not known for their physical or intellectual prowess.
That's right, sir. He does a thorough background check and if he finds them to be criminal or guilty of embezzlement, then he will put them in the park. He has refused the last three suggested "guests".
Yes sir. It turns out we put an innocent man into the "park" and he was not the one who stole from the stamp machine. That is also about the time when Bruce began refusing.
Bruce may still refuse. It is my belief that he is becoming more belligerent.
Just a temp who pissed me off and a girl who turned me down for the night of her life.
Shit, I forgot about them. Well, I guess the boss man wasn't as tough as I thought.
You're paying the bills.
I've never heard the Flintstones reduced to a sexual exploitation quite like that. You're funny.
I just need to sit and think for a second.
We made it !
Oh, just put it over there.
I thought I told you to lose this guy.
I think the phrase was &quot;Sleazoid Geek&quot;.
You're still asking me to break the law.
Well the thing is your room is right next door to ours, and so we thought, well, I thought, if you were willing we might move you to Grammoo's room, and use your old room for the nursery. See we're gonna be up half the night with a newborn and there'll be a lot of noise....
Well not far, just down the hall. Plus Grammoo's room's a lot bigger, and you get a view of the whole neighborhood.
Was it a nice funeral?
Look we react to every kick this baby gives, maybe Vada's trying to tell us something too.
Maggie Muldovan? Did you...know her?
Well, we didn't have a camera...so she just wrote the date on the bag and said, &quot;This will be out wedding album, this will be a day we will never forget.&quot; We never did.
I've got something better.
Well actually I was born in Siberia and then they shot her and sent me home to my Dad.
My mother.
I never met my mother.
It's not funny! I mean what am I gonna do? Without that yearbook I'm lost. I can't just walk around town looking for someone with a Wilson High School Letter sweater!!!
WHAT??
At least it gives you plenty of exercise.
Jerk! You IDIOT!!!
You better ace it...you sacrificed our whole vacation.
Ahh, that's right, like one big happy family. This is Nick's room and uhh....
Dating, seriously dating. You're thirsty, want something to drink? Sure you do, it's been a long trip.
Yeah, well he left out a couple of steps, ah look, I've gotta get back to these bills, Phil will you help Vada get settled?
Is that a yes?
You couldn't?
Sort of?
Where I come from, involvement...generally calls for a substantial piece of jewelry.
All right, so you don't like jewelry but...eh...you do like...eh...good music. Liszt, one of my favorites.
Hungarian. Famous for their beautiful music...and beautiful women.
You have no idea.
Can't stay, I'm just here because my wife.....
What Hurts Vada?
No. Just, more activity.
Old Spice, Phil says it's a timeless classic.
Is it really your camper?
They come in all sizes honey, just like shoes.
In a minute, look it's hot, sweetie you'll burn your nose, look out.
I forgot about that picture, where did you find it?
Ahh, that little Chevy was your mothers favorite car.
She was pretty, and kind, she had your eyes. Oh boy did she love to laugh. Sometimes when you laugh, you sound just like her.
Uh huh. You know what your mother did when she found out she was gonna have you? She came home and painted this whole room pink. She was so sure she was gonna have a little girl.
Yes, I did, very much for a long time, and even now, I get a little sad when I think of a pretty flower or a sunset that your mother would have liked.
That's good, memories are good sweetheart. Vada, I'm sorry; I was trying to keep it from you, I just couldn't. You're a good girl, and I want you to be happy; don't be an old grump like me.  Seeya in the morning.
Oh, Vada...
Pause as he takes all this in I think your Dad would miss you.
I'm not upset. I will never play with those girls. I only surround myself with people who I find intellectually stimulating.
Can I use your bathroom first?
You don't have to wait, daddy'll be mad if you're late.
Yes!!
Hey there's your Dad and Shelly.
That was Grammoo's. It's a phrenology chart, they used to study the bumps in your head to see if you had a good personality or not. Come here, i'll diagnose your head.
Come on, it's fun.
My mood ring! It fell off! I gotta find it!
I'm gonna marry Mr. Bixler.
It is not.
Not true.
Like they do on TV?
No.
But, I don't know how.
I'm just glad someone finally put this thing in its proper perspective.
He's still in love with you.
Chill?  Since when do you say ch...
I can't even say it.
You need a few dollars.
What? Because I'm a little understand...
... always.  The best dim sum, the best camping stuff...
... best valley in New Zealand, best... women's shoes...
We settled this.  And I reneged. That wasn't fair.
It's Jules, you guys haven't had a call from, say, Kimberly, have you?
I told him, get the important stuff, Kim's ring.  I'll collect the inconsequentials.
W...
Till the gas ran out.
Michael!!
Except for the hot affairs we'll have twice a year.
Me, too.  I'm getting married tomorrow.
No, it's for the best, it really is.  We were so wrong for each other.
The job thing would have broken us up, eventually, anyway.  She couldn't have lived with it.  I know that now.
Shhh.
If you find her...
What is that sup...
Hi! Star.
I won first prize.
Eater  says she doesn't see how you do it.
Oh just about everything, I guess. Those doctors started on an overhaul and don't want to quit. They keep taking things out. She's going to come home an egg shell. Tough, though.. She's tough.
Green.
Absolutely. Listen, Barnett, I understand your position.
Nothing; Barnett. It's my job.
Stop it!
The Hell he did. Look, I'll see you in the morning.
No. Mr. Green, I don't know how to tell you this -- your wire passed away -- I thought they'd called you at home.
It's hard to say. Doctors thought she'd come home a week ago. All it was was appendix.
Did an exploratory and according to them, she needed an overhaul.
I've been a Little dyspeptic.
But, I'll take some of that Nyquil... you know it puts you right to sleep no matter what's wrong, you go right off...
I can't.
How much?
You're not.
Sleeping.
Out.
Well, you just remember, if you can't kick front, kick back, 'cause at least you're kicking... Ten minutes, okay?
Yes, you are.
I said we'd give you an interview. I never said we wouldn't kill you.
What?
Did you ever do one on Wayne Gacy?
Whose ratings were higher?
How 'bout Ted Bundy? Ever do one on him?
Good...yuppie piece of shit.
How 'bout Manson?
Yeah, it's pretty hard to beat the king.
Could I get a Coke for Mickey?
I said I'd give you a interview. Now unless I'm mistaken, we just did a interview.  We did an interview, didn't we?
And a snake-eye glare.
He squashed him mentally before physically defeating him.
Mickey and Mallory have that edge.
They've hypnotized the nation.
I'm as serious about that as I am about going back to the donut store, and dipping that stupid Mexican's head into the batter for forgetting my chocolate cream filled. Gimme that other box.
That dumbass probably put my chocolate cream filled in there by mistake.
What's the big deal? Take out my chocolate cream filled, put one of these roasted coconut---
So you're giving a man who butchers whole families, little babies included, my chocolate cream filled?
Yeah, sure.
Why?
How so?
But you'll never be whole again.
Stay up here and finish your interview, I've got to see what the hell's going on down there before I can take responsibility for you to film there.
That's right.
Okay.
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
I still don't know what you're talkin' about.
Used to be. On the railroad.
Well, what d'you know?!
'That right? I thought he was up North.
Where's he at?
You must be new in town.
Well, my mother was the only good teacher the colored school ever had. Nobody bothers with those kids.
It's hard to see any change. But I'm going to stay. Another year, anyway.
It's better than it used to be. Eight years ago they still had a lynching here. They tied a man to a car and dragged him to death. My father knew who did it, but he didn't say anything.
Well, what d'you think?
It'll be fine when we get done with it.
My father's never done a thing for any of them.
Watch out!
How 'bout the key?
Workin' a saw mill.  Here's to.
Sorry.
It's for your own good.
You can be cocky now, boy. But you won't make it. You won't last. I just feel sorry for Josie. I knew it wouldn't work out.
What's the matter?! You mad at me?
Nothin'.  She's all right. Wouldn't have made it without her. Christ - haven't worked in eight months. Right now, I'm waitin' for some insurance money. And man, when I get it, I got plans to make me some more.  Let's get out'a here. This place gives me the willies.  You got some money?
What's the matter?! It's a celebration!
Don't give her the satisfaction.  Your wife is on her way...
My man's coming to get my ass out of here. That's good enough for me.
Play it straight with me and you've got nothing to worry about. When it's over, I inject you with the antitoxin.
What does this have to do with me?
Put the Sense/Net Police on it. The matrix is their turf.
Could be your A.I.'s calling card.
No, but it traced me.
Are you even really alive?
Steppin' razor a warrior. But this man...  ...This man stone crazy. Surely, the Mute is a false prophet. Our paths uncertain.
I need its matrix coordinates, Dixie. I've got to nail that thing where it lives.
A guy who calls himself Armitage.
Nobody has.
Not good enough, man. They planted something inside me. I'm on my own countdown.
Less than thirty minutes.
Don't worry, Dix. I'm on a roll.
There's no call for violence. I've simply accessed your memory for a spokesperson. You use that gun and it will only create another inconvenient interruption. You see, you've been avoiding me, Case.
We'll find out soon enough. If you don't pull the splices out.
I don't sleep much. You packed?
Sure... Maelcom's a rude boy, right, Maelcom?
Well, do you?
Nice.
Yeah, I know.
Well. I like a man who gets to the point.
If you say so.
Jos - Maybe you should turn it down.
It's great! They're behind you. They feel like they know you.
Transitioned?
You're a sick puppy, Geller.
Maybe I could talk to Rigfort, you know, tell him the whole story.
Josie, you rock my world. You're like the most amazing girl I've ever dated. You're so smart and fun and crazy! You rock my world.
No. They're at the Franklin Hint Expo at the Skokie Holiday Inn.
I know.
That's what makes you interesting.  As a teacher.
You do. Seem to. Have passion. In the classroom.
I don't have to say that.
No, surprise, I thought you'd be--
You were attracted to me?
Wait, I was going to tell you--
But now you don't have to--
I did exist. I do exist. I'm the same person!
I don't! Look, you could get to know me, again.
I'm handing out a free lei to every customer! What do you think?
Change is scary. Robbie, let me tell you a little something about the mail business. I've been in it over thirty years. And in those thirty years, the only thing that's changed is the Elvis stamp and some gun laws. People are bored! They wanna shake things up!
We went through the door...
I know.
I'm grown up now.  I have to leave some time.
I can't help it.
<i>                      -- A box? --        Is it steel? --                     Are there locks? -- Is it filled with a pox? --                          A pox! -- How delightful, a pox!</i>
Just out for a while.
Oh, come on Dad...
Where's Jesse?
I want him back.  Jesse, talk to me. Jesse!
Yeah, well, Schneider's got a stick up his ass today.
That's okay, I wanted to.
World History.  But, I'll see you in the morning, right?
What's this?
I'm fine.  Nothing's wrong.
yeah, I had a bad night.
My Dad thinks I'm on drugs, my Mom thinks I'm crazy and I'm not sure I don't agree with her.
Hi.
How'd you sleep, honey, okay?
Can't it wait till morning?
He's close...
He's heavy in the halls...
Why is that?
I lost too much over this already.  I'm through with it.
Doesn't matter.
No...
What?
I know what it is.  I just can't believe what I'm hearing.  What has she talked you into?
I won't allow it.
I'm a vegetarian.
Fine.
Yes.  Well.  My pleasure.
No, it's my fault, I thought this would all be over by now.  I just wanted to sort of apologize for the kissing thing.  I seriously don't know what got in to me.  I just wanted to make sure you were fine about it.
There's no 'unless.'  No one has said "whoopsidaisies" for fifty years and even then it was only little girls with blonde ringlets.
Don't think about it.  We'll sort it out.  Now what would you like -- tea ... bath...?
You and every person in this country.
What is it about men and nudity? Particularly breasts -- how can you be so interested in them?
No seriously.  I mean, they're just breasts.  Every second person in the world has got them...
But... they're odd-looking.  They're for milk.  Your mum's got them.  You must have seen a thousand of them -- what's the fuss about?
That's not true.  And wait a minute... this is crazy behavior.  Can't we just laugh about this?  Seriously -- in the huge sweep of things, this stuff doesn't matter.
I see.  That reality is a real 'no,' isn't it?
Okay.  Fine.  Fine.  Good decision.
Miracles do happen.
He wouldn't say.
Tony -- what do you think?
Me?
Well, yes.  Groovy.
The others?
Can you tell her I'll ring her back.
Okay -- perfect timing as ever -- hold the fort for a second will you, Martin?
I believe I have.
No, don't think I do.
Yes -- she might think you don't have true love on your mind.
No, 'fraid not.
That's compared to, like, earthquakes in the Far East or testicular cancer?
I'm going to throw out these old videos.
Right -- let's talk about rent...
Yes, thank you, Miss Ratched. Since our last meeting I have been reflecting, quite seriously, on the nature of my problem. Naturally, I'm referring to the capacity to obtain the necessary results in order to obtain... No, no. To personify the very existence of that relationship regardless of the function...  Regardless of the function, we will confront the question of... Yes. Yes. The question of... Existence... Relationship... Function... Confront... Yes, confronting us in the moment of deepest crisis... Yes, the crisis of our souls. Of our souls, which I am trying to fully understand the problem... the problem. Not to shut ourselves off, but somehow... Somehow to understand fully our capacity... to obtain... to personify... the question... existence depends... depends on the question... to reflect... to reflect...
Mister McMurphy!
Mister McMurphy, there are old men here who couldn't hear the music at all if it were lower. That music is all they have, and I wish you wouldn't lean against the glass there, your hands are staining the window.
I'm sorry, Mister McMurphy, I count only eight.
But there are eighteen patients on the ward, Mister McMurphy.
I'm sorry, Mister McMurphy, but you must have a majority to change ward policy.
Yes, Miss Ratched...
I-I d-d-don't know! M-M-Miss R Ratched g-g-g-g...
Ah-ah-ah-are y-y-y-you g-g-g-going t-t-t-to muh-muh-muh-marry her?
C-C-C-C-Candy!
Wu-wu-wu I-I-I-I th-th-think sh-sh sh-she's th-th-th-the ma-ma-ma-most bu-bu-bu-beautiful wu-wu-wu-woman in th-th-the whole world!
What for?
Hey, what's that?
Me too...
Now, what would I be trying to say?
What are you talking about??? Everybody was covered!!! Everybody was covered!!!
Hit me.
Me, too! Me, too!
It is worth considering... Miss Ratched?
Yeah, you don't know how to get outta this place!
Sure...
Now, wouldn't you pray for twenty bucks, a bottle booze an' a piece of that angel cake?
What?
I'm sure you will.
Oh...
Evenin', ma'am.
Why, sure, ma'am...
Jus' cleanin' up, ma'am.
Cleanliness is a twenty-four-hour job, ma'am...
Yes, but...  He was having an affair.
My friend has lost her fucking mind...
You're sure...
Yes.  We did.
What's mezzaluna?
That's it.  That's it.  That's all I need to know.  Bless you, thank you, thank you.
Thanks.
I take it things didn't work out between the two of you?
I know I'm limping.  I stubbed my toe.
NO.
He likes to read...  Did he mention anyone in particular?
What?
Thank you, Peter.  Thank you so much.
No, it was more than that.  It was very generous of you.  It was very kind.
Yes.
Yes?
Oh, Faith.  My name's Faith.
Yeah.  He's around somewhere.
No.  He's never asked me.
Why should I ask someone out who I don't want to go out with in the first place?
But it's July.
What about your job?
You don't have a passport.
Because you were afraid to fly.
Does Dwayne know about this?
You and the other 99% of the women in the world.
You know, no offense or anything Kate, but I think I'm starting to see Larry's side of the story.
Nothing.
Because I'm the one who's single.
Sure you did.
Okay, okay.  You join him.  But first will you ask if he's here?
You sure you'll be okay?
I'll be back before you leave.
So.  I guess I've got a wedding to go to.
I thank you.
She said she knew where to find him, and then she grabbed my car keys, and--
She didn't give me a chance.
Sure we keep records!
We was robbed last night and we can't find no books.
What do you mean, odd? We was robbed like I told you.
I just fnished work. I counted the bags.
Why me, Charley? I'd feel funny going in there.
But going in that church, I'd be stooling for you, Charley. You make a pigeon out of me.
Hello, Edie.
You think I'm just a gravy-train rider in a turned-around collar?
I only live up there and across the roof.
Listen, Edie, am I going to see you again?
I don't know.
Edie, down here it's every man for himself. It's keepin' alive! It's standin' in with the right people so you can keep a little loose change jinglin' in your pocket.
If you don't  Keep your neck in and your nose clean and You'll never have no trouble down here.
I I brought this for you, Terry. It was Joey's.  Yours is coming out at the elbows.
Go ahead, wear it.
Don't hang on to me. And don't follow me. Don't follow me.  Call the Father. Ask him to take care of Charley for me. My brother. There's something I got to do.
What are you going to do?
Edie. The Commission. Your subpoena. I know you got a subpoena.
A question of who rides who.
How much is your soul worth if you don't?
Ball games! Don't break my heart! I wouldn't care if he gave you a life pass to the Polo Grounds. So you got a brother. Well, let me tell you something you got some other brothers and they're all getting the short end while your cousin Johnny gets mustard on his face at the Polo Grounds. If I was you   Listen, I'm not asking you to do anything, Terry. It's your own conscience that's got to do the asking.
Good luck.
We're getting ready to hold public hearings on waterfront crime and underworld infiltration of longshore unions.
You'll work.
Raise a hand to me and... .
You'd be off the pier for good.
No.
Aw, you know I don't like to count, Johnny.
What do you mean?
What are you down here for to see we don't make off with any of Mister Friendly's precious cargo?
I'm afraid I'll faint.
The Princess of Darkness would have you for her own to join us through extreme pain.  Yet I am inclined for one as lovely as you, to be more lenient. I have but to touch you with my finger, and it would mean the end of you, all over, quickly and painlessly...
I repulse you?  Very well.  It seems you have chosen your own fate. Live with it!  I should say <b>die</b> with it!
From Glades to the turnpike.  Then I left with Glenn.
Yes.
Get the shotgun.  And her purse.  I'd like to know who she is.
Say anything in there about Karen Sisco?
Yeah, but what happened after she drove off with Glenn?
She just sat there, looking right at me.
I saw Karen Sisco.
Shit.
They're gonna rape the maid, aren't they.
And then they'll kill 'em.
You're gonna use a ram?
The manager's door is metal.
How are you, Raymond?
It seems to me I been reading about you in the newspaper.  Busted out of some joint in Florida, huh?
Someone down here?
I don't recall his hat, but I've seen pictures of him lying dead, shot by Texas Rangers.  Did you know he didn't have his shoes on?
They put a hundred and eighty-seven bullet holes in Clyde, Bonnie Parker and the car they were driving.  Bonnie was eating a sandwich.
It was May, 1934, near Gibsland, Louisiana.
I can go to the bar.
Those guys bother you?
I couldn't believe it.  I was thinking of you by then, a lot, wondering what it would be like if we did meet.  Like if we could take a time-out...
Who you talkin' to, Studs?  Me, or Buddy.  I can't tell, you got those shades on.
I guess the bright glare out here made it hard to see the numbers on the weights.
How many?
Okay.  How many going out?
When?
You know who they are?
Oh, yeah, I'm calm.  In fact, I'm totally "relaxed..."
Glenn?
You crazy, come up <u>here</u>?  It's fuckin one degree outside.
Uh-huh.
Some<u>one</u>?  Gimme a hint.
Gimme another hint.
Great.  We got one of 'em.
Where do you think I might find Maurice?
The State Theater?
He's pretty laid back, confident.
Not at all.
I want to bust his ass, put him in shackles.
My married boyfriend - setting him up with that news story so you could talk about infidelity.  I couldn't believe it.
Foley <i>kid</i>napped me.
No.  Course not.
Forget about her.  Tell me where the money's at.
Where the fuck is Foley?
Ooo, she's thinking of her date!  Come on, you've been dating a pilot.  We want to know what we can expect.
A m-missionary?
Good shooting, Rafe!
Home of the brave!
How sweet.  Is that when you put the move on her?
Danny, what the hell are you trying to do out there?
No.  You're trying to beat me.
Bullshit.  We've played with each other, pushed each other.  This is different. Like you want to prove that you're better than me.  Who's that for -- Evelyn?
He told me he didn't want to leave me with regret.  Now that's all I have.
Well...sure.
I take it back, about the flowers.  We're all gonna die.
No, he...got some news today.  He'll be okay, he just didn't feel like coming tonight.
They were bringing back a ship full of wounded and needed extra nurses along.  I wrote Colonel Doolittle, and told him I needed to see you before you go.
It was.  I couldn't have you go away, wherever it is...to war...without knowing something.  You think I made a choice, of Danny over you.  I didn't.  I didn't have a choice.  I'm pregnant.
Crank her!
Stag movies. Smokers.
I don't know how you do it. I've never even dated anybody but Charlie.
We did for a long time. We just got married too young, and ended up blaming each other for missing out on things.
On what?
Yeah. I've gotta go. Arthur's picking me up soon.
Pretty strange.
You mean my wang? Listen, it's running real late.
That's real big of you.
You're kidding. You wrote a song? Is it about a guilty girl and a trusting guy... she wants to hurt him, and he wonders why?
I know.
What would that be, sir?
Of course.
He won't tell me, but I've got my suspicions. And I don't want any of that. Don't keep her out late.
Is that one of your poems?
I'd love to.
That would be impossible.
Mom, is there any coffee left?
Look young lady, I grew up through the depression. I fought in the second World War. Six days a week I get up and deal with the public, the bank and the bill collectors. And on the seventh day, when God rests, I don't have to listen to my daughter calling me a fool!
Oh Mom, I forgot you were ever so young.
For what?
I don't feel very festive.
You know, you two are wonderful parents. I'm really going to try to behave myself.
I'm not doing any tutoring this year. I'm too busy.
All right. I'll be in the physics lab. Make it fourthirty. I have a rocket club meeting.
When do we start?
It's all, gone wrong, nothing's working out.
You were meant to. You're one of those fortunate people that good things happen to. I have to get out of here.
--Drew, he's your dog. Are you listening to this?
It's been a few years.
I'm not hungry.
Zowie.
He was dead. You know he was.
Good. He said he'd be over for dinner at eight...  I mean... he misses you, Mom...
Because they deserve to, Walter.
He's not sorry, okay, fine.  Why don't we see what we find out from the blood work? I'll work on getting a specimen, I'm sure hospital food could help in that direction. Maybe, by then, we'll hear from my doctor, and we'll go from there. Okay? Everybody happy?
Ready for what, baby?
I hope you're ready for "Studs," because that's what's on.
Sounds delightful.
Charles, I must apologize again, for the Kronos mishap.  It was a scary few minutes around here. Wow. But thank God, the complaint was found. And no damage was done.
Arline decision. Supreme Court.
Want to hear my favorite aria?
Sure thing.
That's right.
Absolutely.
One. Here, in front of my ear.
Well... One time, Mr. Wheeler's secretary, Lydia, told me Mr. Wheeler had a problem with my earrings.
Why are we going to do that?
You want to give me an AIDS <u>test</u>?!
But he's got lots of other people's lives to ruin...
Yeah... ?
Lisa, c'mon. One guy sticking his dick in another guy's mouth? It's disgusting.
Yes, we did.
Dr. J.!
Lookit. Lookit!
Four fulls, one half. That mean we're halfway there? I hope?
We can, can't we? Trust you?
Riddick? How close?
Cargo hold, everyone in the cargo hold. lesgo, lesgo, lesgo.
Thought you found his restraints over there. Toward sunset.
Ease up, ease up. JOHNS! Just tell me what....
That's what I said.
What the hell's it matter?
79 kilos.
He's dead. Cap'n's dead. Christ, I was looking right at him when --
You hear me? Captain's dead. Owens too.
And you're certain you can find the way back? Even in the dark?
Think a soul could get lost there? With all those pilgrim-types?
I'll need a receipt for that.  For all these.
Not afraid of the dark, are you?
Kept calling it "murder" when I did it.
Sacrifice play. Hack up one body, leave it at start of the canyon. Like a bucket of chum.
Nice embellishment.
So which one caught your eye?
What, it's broken?
Zaius seems to think there might be another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone. That's what  we'll try for. What about you?
Good luck then.
It's probably wrong --
The evidence was very meager --
That was before Dr. Zaius and half the Academy said the idea was heresy.
Blessed are the vegetarians.
Sustained.  Your archeological theories have no bearing on the disposition of this creature.
What signal?
Let's take a look.
I'll start by following the shoreline.  And my nose.
Dr. Zira! Silence that man!
Oh, your case was preordained. In a way, you performed a service for the State ...  Because your hearing made it possible for us to expose Zira and Cornelius.  And now the Tribunal has placed you in my custody for...final disposition. Do you know what that means?
Emasculation, to begin with. Then experimental surgery. On the speech centers. On the brain. Ultimately, a kind of living death.
Listen, listen -- I can speak --
Taylor, please --
He doesn't know.
How the hell did he get away?
De fool think he's gonna get it but he ain't known for his thinking.
I got one...
Yeah.
I volunteered.
Yeah, I dropped out of college and told 'em I wanted infantry, combat, and Nam...
You a crazy fucker, givin' up college man.
Barnes gets killed, his jaws'd go on clacking...
Baaaa! Fuck it, they sold us out - so what! What'd you'all expect? Civilian life is phoney BULLSHIT man. They're ROBOTS man - watchin' dopey television and drivin' dopey cars, and they fuck up, nobody dies. That's all right, you keep fuckin' up, politicians keep lyin'. Cause it don't really matter. Don't mean shit. So what! Whatcha want - a parade! Fuck that too! No war time no grunt never got no respect. Till he was dead - and even THEN! You're fighting for YOURSELF man! You're fighting for your SOUL, dat's all. Remember dat. And it's some goddamn battle too - if you'se a man, wrestle with that angel...  ...Love and Hate - the whole shitbang show, that's the story then and now and it ain't hardly gonna change...
Would you mind?
If you change your mind about the cocktail party, or anything else, give me a buzz.
Disgusting, aren't they? If you really want a Martini, I know where you can get one.
I'd rather wait until it does matter.
You don't know who he is?
He was following us--but he's not a policeman.
All right--following me.
No matter. There's nothing I can do about it.
Take me home--and forget you ever saw me. That's a silly remark isn't it?
You wouldn't like it.  I've been there.
And I'm begging for my life--and yours.
Yes.  Yours.  You haven't murdered anybody.  You killed Mitchell. Wasn't that an accident?  It must have been.  If you kill a blackmailer, you kill him dead--so that he can't talk anymore.
And that nasty man that followed us last night.  You didn't kill him.
Magruder does.
But the next one is murder.  First the little step, then the longer step , and then the step you can never take back.  You could tell about Mitchell.  You could tell about Magruder--and the detective. It would hurt, but you could do it.  You could never tell about me.
Every day of your life you'll want me.  You'll never get over it. Every time you see your face in the mirror--
They're all crude, when they don't work. Had breakfast?
To do what?
What will they do to you?
You're still a police officer, Jeff.  I saw you send those two men away. I know they were watching me.
If I call the police, your price will go down to a minus sign.
For five hundred, what do I get?
For two hundred?
You mentioned information.
A thousand.
Got the information on you?
A private joke.
I don't.
Lay off, can't you?
Thank you. It is rather late... and I'm not young anymore. Good night.
One of those nice long manila envelopes--sealed.  Not too fat- not too thin.
You get it's brother.
Maybe we've been pretty dumb--
Not quiet yet.
I hear she's a very pretty girl.
Aye.  You have a point there.
You know what would happen to you if I turned these over to the police?
You'd go to jail. For a long term.
What a shame.
Well, I am a great admirer of your work.  I read your books on Chartism when I was still at school.  I'm a journalist, not a historian.  There are questions of method, and approach.  I wondered--
Yes.
Didn't Evelyn Waugh say that the country under Atlee seemed to be under enemy occupation?
What went wrong?
I see.
No, it's all right.  I can get a cab.  Night night.
I haven't really thought about it.
Name so Susie Barrington.  Daughter of the eminent historian, Anne Barrington, step-daughter of the scandalous Matthew Byrd the acclaimed sack-artist...
Yes, finally.
Are you up to something?
The bed's all made up if you want to stay.
It's because he desires you.  The women get all the breaks at these conferences.
Then one of them was sick all over your new dress.
I know that part.  Tell me something I can use, here.
A flaw I'm working on.
Yeah, right, vision is highly over- rated.
Whoa, whoa!!  Think it through!  I'm the only one knows where they are. Just let me talk for a second.
SHIT!!
Caught my first tube this morning.
The Ex-Presidents are the best I've seen, kid.
It sticks out, so I can't lock it. Look, Angelo, you think I joined the FBI to learn to surf?  This was your lame-o idea in the first place.  You gotta back me up on this.
Nice tattoo, Dietz.
Shrimp and fries.
I need you to teach me.
I'm serious.
Well, I'm just gonna go back out there till I catch on to it or break my neck.
What?
I... I don't know.  I can't describe what I'm feeling.
What do you mean?
Jesus... this is inhuman.  Uh... I wasn't told of any operations in this area. They shouldn't have been here.
Anytime.
That's the problem. Apparently they strayed off course.  We're certain they've been captured by the guerrillas.
Twenty-five percent.
What?
What's that?
Uh, no.  How do I get to Beverly Hills?
Yes.
Fine.
Edward.  My name is Edward.
Oooh, thank god.
I sell them.
Upset.  No.  I never get upset about business.
Whether I liked him or not is irrelevant.  It's business. There's no emotion involved in business... if you want to survive.
He's good at what he does.
Shall we mingle?
Where are you taking me!?
Huh?
Not all men hit.  And no one is going to hit you anymore.
It was a business decision.
Yes!  And you don't even know where you're going!
Hear me out.  I've known you a long time.  I see a difference in you this week.  Like that tie. I'm suddenly wondering if this girl's not the difference. Especially when I see her talking with David Kross.
Viv... don't be stupid.  We're whores.
Do I!?  Momma!
I rather hoped you'd be wearing it.
That's all right.  I'm sure they're quite lovely.
'Scume me.
May I live a thousand years and never hunt again.
I swear it will be done.
If you'll release me ... whatever you ask for ransom ... you'll get it, I promise you...
I was giving you a chance. No matter where you take me ... there's no greater hunter than Prince Humperdinck. He could track a falcon on a cloudy day. He can find you
Of course you will.
Hear this now: I will come for you.
This is true love. You think this happens every day?
What hideous sin have you committed lately?
It never happened.
It never happened. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          117.
I just don't think it's right, killing an innocent girl.
How many could you handle?
That leaves twenty for me. At my best, I could never defeat that many.  I need Vizzini to plan. I have no gift for strategy. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           82.
Right, right, sorry.
The Eel doesn't get her. I'm explaining to you because you looked nervous.
As you wish...
I swear it will be done.
True, but that's hardly common knowledge, is it?  Thank you. Now, there may be problems once we're inside.
He's already dead.
That does put a damper on our relationship.
And what is that?
You keep using that word -- I do not think it means what you think it means.  My God! He's climbing.
I'll tell you in a minute. First, let's drink -- me from my glass, and you from yours.
"Of the silvery moon,
"I want to croon,
"To my honey I'll croon,
"Honeymoon,
"Keep a shining in...
I'm sorry ... I don't like people touching my blue blanket.  It's not important.  It's a minor compulsion. I can deal with it if I want to. It's just that I've had it ever since I was a baby and ... and ... I find it very comforting.
Mr. Bialystock ...
It's a little better, but you still look angry.
Shut up, you idiot.  He's a harmless nut.  Play along with him.  It's almost in the bag.
I'm turning myself in.  It's the only way.  I'm going to cooperate with the authorities.  They'll reduce my sentence and then there's time off for good behavior.  And maybe I'll get a job in the prison library.  So long.
We swear it!
Yes.  We would!
All right.  Finish the job.  Let's get outta here.
Here I come, ready or not.
Oh joy of joys!  Oh, dream of dreams!  I can't believe it.  Birds, birds, do you hear?  Otto, Bertz, Heintz, Hans, Wolfgang, do you hear?  Ve are going to clear the Fuhrer's name.  Fly, fly, spread the words.
"Deutchland, Deutchland ... "
Vat?
OH.  "I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy, Yankee Doodle is my ... " Listen, this is not place to talk.  Come! 
She might have used an alias. Mary Crane's the real name, but she might've registered...
She was seen leaving town in her car. Seen by her very victims, I might add.
I don't need pills... just sleep.
Just what he told your detective.
Sam! Why call when we can go?
Of course we will.
Why not?
The bathroom.
Thank you, Mr. Bates.
I'm sorry.
Arbogast.
This place! This isn't 'a place.' It's my only world. I grew up in that house back there. I was a happy child. My mother and I... we were more than happy.
Nothing. Here, let's clear the path.
Who are you? What is your name?
By the way--did you hear a shot last night?
I'm going to call the police.
No?
Delighted, I'm sure. 
The body of Joan Gale!
I'm not kidding. Joan Gale's body is packed in the box in the basement, and I saw the most horrible thing down there.
Don't take my word for it. Get down there yourself and give a look.
I want to see the original pictures of Joan Gale.
There's an autopsy ordered at Bellevue immediately. You better skip over there.
It's all yours.
Cry-baby?
My lawyers will be on the job in a little while, and I warn you people anything you print about me you've got to prove. Dad won't stand for--
For a few minutes the afternoon before -- before --
They didn't give me a chance. We had a couple of drinks and she was all right then. She seemed happy.
She laughed and told me that we were being silly, that we didn't care for each other any more but we needn't hate each other ...  ... She said she wanted to be friends.
We planned a trip for her. I was going to send her to Bermuda.
No.  Why didn't I take her out somewhere? But she was laughing and seemed so happy.
Stolen! What are you trying to do to me? ... You're working with the police! ... You're trying to make me say something that can be used against me! You're trying ...
Then why are you telling me a crazy lie? ...
Who'd steal her body?
I want the money back I've thrown into this rubbish heap.
Don't lose sight of him. This is the most important thing in my life.
Where to?
That's the physicist's playground.
Then you get it.  You'll understand.
What did you expect?
Ha ha ha, that's some idea, a cantaloupe.
Buddy, quit that, you're just a child, you're not supposed to be interested in such things.
You know, that Daddy of yours is the funniest man, the things he says, you never know what's going to come out of his mouth next.
No, you can't. And I'll tell you this -- he scares me. As kind as he is, he scares me. You can't fool around with him, not with that man. And, boy, I sure better not try nothin' like that with him again, he'll fire me.
Buddy, what's come over you? A child like you, askin' such things.
I have a knack for designing clothes. But I had to buy the shoes and the pocketbook.
Oh, Waski, you don't even know what we're talking about.
Well... maybe...
Oh, shut up, Buddy.
Buddy, that was my place.
Hello, Daddy. How are you?
It isn't Yankee whisky, Daddy, it's Scotch.
Then... may I speak quite frankly with you, Mr. Hillyer?
I have of course observed the girl in treating her.
I think we both know her.
The girl worries me. If she walks down the street like that, an army will be following her.
She will succeed.
That farmer in Gadsden was awful eager to get rid of her, and I'm beginning to see why.
Well, she loves children, all right.  She loves everybody.
You are the one who's good-hearted.  As for Rose, let's hope for the best.
Yes, of course.
Honey, please...
Poor thing, don't cry, Rose. I know you feel awful, but don't cry, honey, nobody's perfect. Who's the father, dear?
Who?
If you've got time before you go "out," get me a half-a-cup of coffee, Rose. Not a whole cup, a half-a-cup.
Um-hmmuhh. I never drink a whole cup, my nerves can't stand the caffeine. Ehh-hh, Lord awful insomnia in reverse last night. Lay there and sweated blood for hours.
Wonderful. Except I can touch the place back there with my tongue, I wouldn't even know I had that tooth pulled.
Boy, for four or five days there I didn't think I'd live. But I'm my old self again!
Oh, no, sir.
What?
Doubted my ability all along, the little bitch. I never remarried, Buddy, you know that, don't you?
She's te reason -- cured me of women once and for all. Oh, I got rid of her, Buddy, I didn't waste no time kickin' that bitch out. Hell, she was screwin' everybody in Savannah. I caught her in a motel with this long tall son of a bitch and boy did I beat the everlastin' piss out of him!
I beg your pardon, epi-zoo-tics? Do you mean "epi-zoo-ot-tics," an animal epidemic?
No, Waski, she won't die, because we are praying for her.
Ohh-hh, a little. Oh-h, I ain't never been to no dentist before. He's gonna kill me, I just know it.
I was offered that job as a waitress.
Cuff'em.  Let's see what these two love birds say once they're sitting in separate cages.
Word is, while the vice cops on the East Coast were standing around playing pocket pool, 300 kilos of heroin got smuggled into New York City.  And, right now it's making a cross-country journey to Hollywood, U.S.A.
What do you want me to do about it?
Who's that?  Zimmermann's money-man?
Okay, seriously.  What about Napoleon, huh?
You've never heard of Napoleon brandy, Mister Smarty-Pants?  How do you think it got its name?
Forgive me for not ooing cartwheels over commemorative salt and pepper shakers
Can't you say something nice once?
There'll be other chances.
Wave that flag, hero.  Keep dreaming those dreams.
Shit.  You're right.
Whatever goes bang.
Seatbelts fastened, please.
Yeah.
You father was seduced by the dark side of the Force. He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker and became Darth Vader. When that happened, the good man who was your father was destroyed. So what I have told you was true... from a certain point of view.
His lightsaber.
We got separated.
I don't know.
No, wait! I thought you were blind!
All right! A little higher! Just a little higher!
I'm rather embarrassed, General Solo, but it appears you are to be the main course at a banquet in my honor.
Form up. And stay alert. We could run out of space real fast.
You're wrong, Leia. You have that power too. In time you'll learn to use it as I have. The Force is strong in my family. My father has it...I have it...and...my sister has it.
Your father he is.
I told you, my car broke down.
Yes, Janet.  Life's pretty cheap to that type.
We'll just say where we are Then go back to the car We don't want to be any worry.
Yes.
Goodbye
Now I
Oh my, my,
They didn't like me.  They never liked me.
By accident?
Yes.
What're we going to do?
Oh, Rocky -- you worked so hard.
Don't say that.
You's the novelty, Champ!
Apollo, I'm sure there's a way to salvage this.
Don't like yours neither.
Move your shoulders down.
Charge it.
Mr. Gazzo wants the two hundred now!
Mr. Gazzo says I should get two hundred or break the thumb.
Hey -- if a good man can make a better life, let him make it.
Take your shot, kid -- You got money for trainin' expenses?
Why?
C'mon, Rocky. I'm twelve.
What?
How do you mean?
...I'm doin' it for a friend.
I get the robe an' Paulie gets three grand.
Yeah -- See the fight last night? Apollo Creed beat that English guy bad.
I hate the friggin' game... I'd like to talk some business.
Look at my hands -- See how the joints are swollen.
Sure I like her.
I dunno -- she fills gaps.
She got gaps. I got gaps -- together we fill the gaps.
Don't talk dirty 'bout ya sister.
My problem is I got a fifty-year-old lust and a three-year-old dinkie.
You'll have it in the morning.  Now be a sport and lemme have twenty bucks to put in my pocket.
Check the scrawl.
If I can find whoever wanted to kill Acme bad enough to get this.
He had a will, all right.  She took it off Acme the night she and R.K. Maroon knocked him off.  Then she set up her loving husband to take the fall.
What the hell's a freeway?
That's what this is all about?  Tell me, who's gonna use your lousy freeway? We got the Red Cars, the best public transportation in the country.
That's not Roger.  It's one of Doom's men.  He killed R.K. Maroon.
No one knows.  He bought the election a few years back.  He's been rulin' Toontown ever since.
Sure, Valiant, sure...
Don't do that!  I'm innocent I tell ya. The police'll just dip me.  They were waitin' for me when I got home last night.  I ran.
Gee, Eddie, I'm a rabbit.  We always run.
A blindfold, cigarette, noseplugs? Just kidding.
How much is a shave and a haircut, Roger?
I rest my case.
I will bite my thumb at them; which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.
I do bite my thumb, sir!
[Aside to GREGORY] Is the law on our side, if I say ay?
But 'tis no wit to go.
Hie you make haste! But look thou stay not till the watch be set, for then thou canst not pass to Mantua where thau shalt live till we can find a time to blaze you marriage, reconcile your friends, beg pardon of the Prince and call thee back with twenty hundred times more joy, than thou wentst forth in lamentation. Quick hence! Be gone by break of day! Sojourn in Mantua.
Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed. If that thy bent of love be honourable, Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow, By one that I'll procure to come to thee, Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite; And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay And follow thee my lord throughout the world.
I uh, by and by I come--But if thou mean'st not well, I do beseech thee--
By and by, I come: -- To cease thy strief, and leave me to my grief: To-morrow will I send.
Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed.
A man, young lady! Lady, such a man As all the world- -why, he's a man of wax.
Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower.
Nay, bigger; women grow by men.
Is she a Capulet?
Very good.  Now all we have to do is live long enough to get paid.
That's why you were riding with him.
You were a soldier, were you?
Alright?  It's bloody fucking freezing in here!
I'm touched, really, that they'd send someone of your caliber.  It's nice to know that they didn't make the mistake of underestimating me twice.
I'm sure.  But I'm sorry to say that it's too late for trust: we have a serious problem.
Really?  Do you have the money with you?
You first, Edvard.
I think not.  After you...
But you hate each other!
Hello, my friend.  He doesn't look French to me, Vincent.
Anybody tries to unpleasant me I'll put two between his eyes -- one to do the job and the other to make sure it takes.
I don't think so.
Jujitsu.
Not at all.  Similar, but not the same.
One's a lot more painful than the other.
You weren't around when I woke up, I thought maybe something had happened.  This has been one very fucked up job, Sam, and I'm not taking any more chances on anybody...  Including you...
Yes.
Yeah.  We need out fucking heads examined.
Cause the Russian production company would be easier to find.
Gonna be tough.
I get the picture.
The horniest dog in Nevada.
Oh so God's like Western Union and he just dropped us a couple million bucks?
At the expense of six people.
What are you thinking?
Well neither have I, but it's us or him.  If he talks, or writes a note or whatever, he's gonna turn us in.  Besides, he's just a low life scumbag.  His kind is hardly even human anyway.
Okay then.  I'll do it.
How badly do you want that money?! How bad do you want to stay out of jail?
Who said anything about killing?  Just keep driving straight...
No.  It stops now.  It stops here.
That's the deal.  If you don't like it, forget it, no one wins.
Maybe.  That's where it was during Denning's last report.
It was all over the local news. Dwayne was there, acting all official.
I love you Sally.
Yeah.
I wanted to ask you some questions about last night.
Did you say After Midnight?
Sure.
Oh, that's ok, a lot of men feel uncomfortable when they come in here.
Oh yeah.  Between here and Vegas we get a lot of customers.  All types.  Even had an officer, just like you.
No.  Something wrong with you Dwayne?
Well, I just got a lot of things on my mind is all.
Dwayne put the gun down --
We're gonna talk.
Yeah.  Figured you could have it.
Those are five hundred dollar chips.
No, I just assumed...
No, sir.
Throw us in jail?  I'm about to bust you right now.
How do we know you're not lying?  Let me see your badge.
That's right.
Never leave home without it.  Lee, this one's on me.  You save your money.
Blend in?  I'm two feet taller than everyone here.  Where you going?
She said I could pick any girl I want.
Hey!  You don't break in front of a black man in a buffet line.
What?
I cannot go to LA...
Oh, sweet glory hallelujah...
Skirt just came off.  She's in black bra and panties -- Victoria Secret Spring Catalogue, page 27 -- wait a sec - there's a tattoo on her left thigh... it looks like Snoopy.
She just took her hair down.  Now she's going for the bra -- the clasp is in front -- she's using both hands.  You better get that ice.
We are not partners.  Between your daddy, my daddy, and the beating I just took, as far as I can tell all partners get you is dead.
You got that right.  And we ain't brothers.  Maybe we should just end this right here.
I won't talk to you, you don't talk to me.  We'll die in peace.
I don't believe in reincarnation.  So I won't see you in the next world.
I believe in heaven.  You people believe in heaven?
Is it the same heaven, or is it a Chinese heaven?
I thought it might be like those five foot and under basketball leagues.  They don't let everybody in.
Fine by me.
No.
Mind your own business.
There was no sex.  She was very traditional.  We were waiting until we were married.
No mu-shu.
No kung pao chicken.  Never.
Once in a while, steamed dumplings.  But only when she was drunk.
Tell me the truth, Carter.  Do you think I have a good voice?
Forget it.  It doesn't matter.
Wait here.  I'll handle this.
She's going home to New York.  I need some ice.
And Hu Li killed him for the plates.
Baby Duck?
Put the plates down.  It's over.
The first drop will be made tomorrow. At twelve o'clock.  The amount will be fifty million.
In used currency.  Nothing bigger than a fifty.
You're shittin' me.  You know the Beach Boys?!
What plate?
No.
Did you make the plate?!
He was trying to kill me, not you.
It was a man I was after in Hong Kong.
No, no.  I'm full. Too much fin and hump, you know, gives me gas.  scuse me.
I am sorry, but I have too much respect for women.
Good. That's standard military packaging for plastique. Get a look under it.
This whole thing is goin' down tonight. I need to know where the Ambassador is gonna be. The Feds will be keepin' a lid on everything. You thing you can do that?
Alright, Johnson, thank you.  So...what are you wearing?
Try a bus load of - no, make that two bus loads of Chinese --
Do it!
Ambassador, let me assure you that the FBI has made this a top priority. We have plenty of manpower on the case.
As I said, sir, we've got all the people we need.
Let me take you back inside, okay?
Weird.  Like after all those years you would remem--
I left four messages.  You don't return my calls.
Look, he's in pretty good shape.
Whoa, Ike.  Getting a complex, buddy?
No, I'm not.
Thank you.
Yes.  Conviction.  Conviction that I'm onto the truth.  You're going to do the same thing to "poor bastard number four" that you did to the last three.  You're going to run again.  And I'm not leaving until you do.
We'll see.
I'm not a boastful man.  What's your point?
You don't know.
Maybe you should ask her some time. Ever thought of that?
Yeah.  It's kind of nice.
I love you, too.
Yes, I've seen it.  And I have to say it's the rudest and most offensive... joke anybody's ever played on me!
Thanks.  Will you fix my hair?
Thank you, Dad.
He's allergic to everything, don't worry about it --
That doesn't make any sense.
About what?
You'd probably have to go somewhere to really look into it.
Okay.
Do you want a matrimonial, past wives, any kids--
So you want a financial, is he a deadbeat, we can do a D&B --
A sense of humor.
Oh.  Like Glenn Close in that movie.
You want a tail.  I got a guy in Seattle --
Walter and I are engaged!
It's me?
It's hard to imagine.
How about rapacious and love- starved?
It is easier to be killed by a terrorist --
Right, right.
I don't think I have to now.
You have to give them your phone number or they won't let you go on the air.
Not now, Jonah --
Jonah, I'm leaving --
Victoria? She's okay.
Okay.
Sure.
It'll take him a while to come around.  A month ago he called one of those radio call-in shows and told them I needed a wife --
Now that I'm seeing someone, it's a whole other thing.
Naturally. You think I parked here for a cup of coffee?
No thanks.
That's none of their affair.
It never ends.
Sure. Where they're negotiating. In the company office. We'll go up there and picket the place.
What?
What's more important than sanitation?
What makes you so sure?
All right, but later. I've got a meeting now.
Yes. To plan for the picket line tomorrow.
Yeah. Lots of provocation lately. They figure if they can lock up the leadership on some phony riot charge, maybe they can bust the strike.
What attitude?
He's a guest in my house, isn't he?
Maybe. I think he's got a few things to learn about our people.
How about in the house?
Did you see his hair color?
Leave me out of this.
Nothing.
I don't want anything. Why are you so suspicious?
You really need to lighten up.
I can't tell you.
It's Tom.
I'm serious, dude.  You always seem to be on top of things, even when you're tweakin'.
You mean, like to throw 'em off?
Palmdale
I think on account of his nose.
He doesn't have one.
I'm not a tweaker.  I don't use drugs. I never had.
Understand what?
Big Bill.
Yeah, dickhead.
Danny, he isn't gonna find out it's you.  Domingo was a slinger, he must have sold to hundreds of different people.
Whata you mean?  He told me -
What's to stop him from just ripping me off then?
Hey, you want me to do all your work for you, numbnuts?
Several possession charges, but nothing major.
They have. But they never found a lab.
Come on, where's your pioneer spirit?
Hey, do you think you could eat me if you had to?  And if so, which part do you think you would find the most delicious?
Okay, okay.  There's a house up there. I'll go ask for directions.
Maybe he isn't showing.
In West Fork?
No kidding.
So they travel around from place to place and preach?
What about the Captain?  Where's he from?
Yep, you step on a rusty nail, get lockjaw, never say another word as long as you live.
Jackson, how many times I got to tell you, you're from Tennessee.
Say what, Cap'n?
Don't that get kind of expensive, Cap'n?
To each, his own.
Yes.  Do you know Sibelius' Fourth Symphony, The Normandy?
I heard.
You know classical music?
Where are you from, Captain?
But, sir...
Goddamn it, sir...
PUSH!
How about you shut up and take your position?
Well, if we had ten times the men and a lot more ammo, we might stand a chance, but not against those tanks.
We're going to hope like hell the tanks were on their way somewhere else.
Yeah, how so?
There's to be a bright side, look for it.
There's always a bright side.
Well, I, for one, like cheese.
I thought you said we had an hour, sir?
I coach the baseball team, too.
I won't need to sir, it's already here, behind the barricade so...
We all have, he's got nine lives, or he's bulletproof, or some damn thing.
Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...
Listen, I don't know your name, but what are you doing for lunch?
Lloyd, honey, just come home, okay?
Read it.
I dream about it.
Well, it's almost over.  We've gone to school together for three years, and we've been through a lot.  But with that training out of High School gone, what's going to happen to us?  We all know what the answers are.  We want to be happy, go to college, own a car, maybe raise a family.  But what if that doesn't happen?  I have, I have to be honest though, I have all the hope and ambition in the world.  But when I think about the future, the truth is, I am really...scared.
Dad.
'I like him'?  Diane, I'm talking about being honest with people, being decent...
Eight.
Goodbye.
Twisted?
What?
Basic.  Hmmm.
Job?  Being a great date.
So am I. I want to see you again.  I want to see you as much as I can before you leave.  I said it.
Sixteen weeks is a long time.
Today is tomorrow.
I just don't want it to get too heavy.  I feel really overloaded. I have this theory of convergence, that good things always happen with bad things.  But I know you have to deal with them at the same time, but I just, I mean I don't know why they have to happen at the same time, I mean, I don't know why, I just wish I could work out... Am I just babbling?  Do you know what I mean?
I just can't have any social life right now.
Be friends?
Friends with potential.
Okay, good, this is all very noble.
Oh.  Okay then... Lloyd Dobler, 555-1342.
Dude, I can't do it!
Alright!
A charade?  How could it be a charade?
They're not gone, they're here.
I just told you.
Nice things cost money.
Done.  Lets not talk about it anymore, let's have a good time.
Yes.
Yes.
The war could end.
Give or take what, Stern - how many - count them.
I lost a day of production.  I lost a worker.  I expect to be compensated.
Would it do any good?
The first two were stabbed without thought. The sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision.
What? I can't hear you...
I'm losing you.
Okay, okay. I'll call now. I'll call you back.
Its over, Cotton.
Hey, it's cool. Hallie's into it, I'm into Hallie...
I think it's out of your control.
Aren't most serial killers seemingly harmless?
I see you read the book.
And an explanation is, of course, out of the question.
Oh Dewey, I'm sorry.
Over here.
I'll give you one guess.
Are you in danger now?
Where is your attacker?
Stay under the safety light. Help is on its way.
Please, I have the perfect excuse.
Gotta.
Maureen looks at Phil, confused...as if seeing for the first time...IT'S NOT PHIL. She pulls away when, the Ghost-masked Figure grabs her with one hand, the other one clutching the hunting knife. Maureen sees it, her mouth billowing forth a LOUD SCREAM That is matched by the entire audience as they SCREAM at the screen.
Ne ask that you sell individual squares of toilet paper for a mere nickel a piece.
I get scared really easy, okay.
Look, I'm stuck on the freeway. I think there was some big accident. It could be a little while so I don't want you to start freaking if I don't get there at exactly,  Eight thirty.
Oh I wouldn't miss it for the world. I bet you did such a great job.
Heh heh I bet they are babe. I bet they are. Look, my battery's dying . . .
I'm Gale Weathers, author of the Woodsboro and Windsor College murders, and anchorwoman for TOTAL ENTERTAINMENT. Maybe you've heard of me?
I'm not at liberty to tell you that Miss Weathers. You're no longer working with the L.A.P.D. I don't even know why you're standing in here right now. By all means I should have you thrown out.
In my fifteen years as a homicide detective I've never met a single soul as pushy and brazen as you are Miss Weathers.
Deal, but I'm still Detective Kincaid,ok?
Understood.  If you'll excuse me Detective.  Gale.
Listen, Detective, I wanna see this studio where all this shit's going down.
What so you can just exploit her again with another book? Sid doesn't need you Gale.
Who is it?
I don't know. Screw them. Look, what's important is that we stick together. No matter what. If anyone is next it's you or me Jen.
GALE WEATHERS?! What are you doing here? No press on the set!  No press, no press on set! Get that woman out of here.
I know! He killed Kincaid!
Let's get out of here!
Great. A spirited one. I'll be seeing you real soon Sidney. Real soon.
It's called tact, you fuckrag.
That's right and now that you're no longer a virgin. You gotta die -- those are the rules.
I just wanted to see her, that's all.
Yes, sir.
The police say I scared him off. It wasn't me, Sid.
See, it couldn't have been me. I was in jail, remember?
Understand what? That I got a girlfriend who would rather accuse me of being a psychopathic killer than touch me.
Then what is it? Is there somebody else?
Is it the sex thing? Am I being too pushy?
It's been a year since she died.
When are you gonna let that go, Sid? When my mom left my dad -- I just accepted it. This is the way it is. She's not coming back.
You have to move on, Sid.
Fuck you.
Why don't you want to talk to me?
You tell me your name, I'll tell you mine.
What's that noise?
They'd never make it in time.
Come on. It'll be fun.
It's an easy category. Movie trivia.
I'll even give you a warm up question.
Name the killer in HALLOWEEN.
Come on. It's you favorite scary movie, remember? He had a white mask, he stalked the baby-sitters.
Your call.
I don't think you're so bad.
...yeah...
What were you doing out here?
How is she?
Have to be. The shit she's gone through.
Not my daughter... not my...
Forget it.
Scary night, isn't it? With the murders and all, it's like right out of a horror movie or something.
Do you like scary movies, Sidney?
What's your favorite scary movie?
And why is that?
Oooooh... before or after he sliced and diced.
Working, thank you.
Twice.
There's always some stupid bullshit reason to kill your girlfriend. That's the beauty of it all. Simplicity. Besides, if it's too complicated you lose your target audience.
Maybe Sidney wouldn't have sex with him.
Could be. Now that Billy's tried to mutilate her, you think Sid would go out with me?
Because he's probably dead. His body will come popping out in the last reel somewhere... eyes gauged. See, the police are always off track with this shit, if they'd watch PROM NIGHT they'd save time. There's formula to it. A very simple one. Everyone's always a suspect -- the father, the principal, the town derelict...
So while they're off investigating a dead end, Billy, who's been written off as a suspect, is busy planning his next hunting expedition.
Are you kidding? This is like Christmas.
No prob. I'll pick you up after practice.
Yeah, yeah... are you okay?
I'll be there by seven. I promise
Later.
It was him, Tatum. I know it.
Deal.
Thank you.
Greed.  It was written in blood.
Where was the girl?
Where was the prostitute?  Where was she?
NO!
What the fuck is going on?
Guessing at this point is useless.
Detective Mills here.  Honey... I asked you not to call me here. I'll call you back...  What?  Why?
And, if it's a threat.
Just wait!
I want him bad.  I don't just want to catch him anymore.  I want to hurt him.
No kidding!  No fucking kidding!
I don't know about you, but I feed off my emotions.
We're focusing.
The Divine Comedy.  A History of Catholicism.  A book called Murderers and Madmen.
We had him.
No, actually, I wasn't sure at all.
I can't let you do this...
I guess I won't be showing it to him then.
Did the wife confess?
What, Ben?
No sir...pleasure.
You're right sure you want to <U>jump</U> 'em, Ethan?
There sure is! I'm going to tell you somethin'...I wasn't going to speak of it...But I'll tell you now. Did you notice them scalps strung on Scar's lance?  Did you see the third scalp from the point of the lance? Long... wavy hair...
Grab hold!...
You said there'd be a thousand dollar reward.
You got it with you?
Leggo...
YOUR cattle?...<U>DEBBIE'S</U> cattle!
What?
Oh no! Tell her she's got to go back...
You breeds are all alike -- two drinks an'...
Livin' with Comanches ain't bein' alive...
A little Comanche squaw - SQUAW!
We got two around that age...
You'll have to wait until we reach the agency...Fall in behind the column...
Sorry...  Keep the column moving!..Close ranks there!
Oh, damnit!
Someone from the village.
Ellen, what are you trying to prove, anyway?  That we've created ourselves a ghost?  Come on!
What are you talking about-
Oh no, no.  You're not bothering him.  He has lots of time since he's been retired.
A tumor - which could cause pressure on certain parts of the brain and, thus, influence your perception.
I guess someone lost their key. You did get your tetanus shots, I hope?
Yes.
Really?
Ned is wrong for it.
That's me.
The Apothecary? Will, what is the story? Where is the shipwreck? How does the comedy end?
To the Palace at Whitehall.
No, it will turn out well.
I don't know, it's a mystery.
I will.
There was a wager, I rememberas to whether a play can show the very truth and nature of love. I think you lost it today.  You are an eager boy. Did you like the play?
"Then have my lips the sin that they have took."
I have to get back.
I must. I must
"Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day> It was the nightingale and not the lark That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear. Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate tree. Believe me, love, it was the nightingale."
Lady Viola isyoung in the world. Your Majesty is wise in it. Nature and truth are the very enemies of playacting. I'll wager my fortune.
I was a poet till now, but I have seen beauty that puts my poems at one with the talking ravens at the Tower.
Victory is the same as defeat. It's giving in to destructive competitive urges.
Discussion group, Alex, discussion.
I just thought we should discuss it.
Security.
There was a break-in.
About the mail --
Where do you think you'll go?
Nothing. We thought you were someone else.
What? Oh, yeah, sure, if you want. I tell you, every letter this guy writes to you is the same: they all begin like pure love and descend into open pornography. I dream of your thighs, the soft touch of your white skin leading me in desire, while I, aroused and inflamed --'
I thought we all were.
But you're a doctor. You kill people every day.
And now you tell me.
No, no, it's different.
It tastes different.
I'll wait there.
Everything.
Alex.
As smart as you are, you'll need a little help.
Yeah.
Did you ever kill a man?
I should hope so.
Would you like to see the rest?
It's like recognizing criminals by their crimes.
Lester, don't you think that uhh --
Does she have a pancreatic ulcer?
That's very serious. Who's her doctor?
Gee, that's very serious...
Ruth Lesserman had a pancreatic ulcer.
It turned out to be cancer.
So what are you doing going over there? You're not her doctor.
I hope she's all right.
I wouldn't say so if I didn't.
And I certainly wouldn't tell Lester.
I mean it or I wouldn't say it.
No.
Her?
No.
It isn't?
I guess so.
I guess so.
Okay.
Yeah.
-- Maybe she'll come with us. If I tell her how important it is to me, I don't think she'll mind. Do you?
Jill's really great, isn't she?
Do you? You still see him?
I don't want to... I swear...
Jackie, can we --
-- do you want ice?
No, man.
What?
That's too bad.
Hey, stop by the shop.
Yeah, baby.
When I get off work.
I'll call you.
I'll call you.
Neither do I, baby.
Nothing, I'll call you, okay?
Let go of me.
That's all you've got to say?
-- tell me something -- did you talk about me?
Did you?
Yeah, I know. Did you?
Did you?
Did you?
What did you say?
What did you say?
What did you say?
Oh yeah? I mean I know.
Your hair looks -- well fabulous.
Who?
Hey, you were never going to give me the money.
I am?
Who do you think I was talking to?
Steve?
They're Yorkies and they don't shed.
Oh, honey, don't be totally naive.
No, listen. He's a very good hairdresser.
-- never mind.
-- no.
He's a hairdresser.
Two weeks from tomorrow.
You're going.
No, it's not that...
No.
No.
No.
You mean they ate each other up?
French Fries and Ketchup.
Mr. Halloran, what is in Room 237?
Yeah.
Oh!
Only about three months.  Eh we're from Vermont.  My husband was teaching school there.
Eh... Mr. Grady... weren't you once the caretaker here?
Thank you very much.  I'll do that.
Good.
Your money's no good here.
Lots of ideas.  No good ones.
Yes, I did.
Absolutely nothing.  How is he?
Of course you are.
Wendy...
Wendy...
Well, my predecessor in this job
Royalty?
Fine.
If you don't stop it I'm going to vomit. I mean it.
What's that?
For getting a divorce?
It's just an outward symbol of everything that's inwardly wrong in this town. Not bad, huh? I read Sherwood Anderson in college. I can jive that shit all day.
I'll give you the telephone numbers of my ex-wives, dear boy- they'll be interested to hear that.
But you are, you know- you are my dear boy.
I didn't shoot him when he was a man. I shot him when he was-
Yes... you've always been that to him. But if you can't leave your booze in whatever dump you call home, you better just stay away.
What you say?
Hey, Sisters.  Are you going in there?
You lying sleazeball!  The best years of my life!  What am I, garbage?  Am I lint?
Not in years.
Why?
But don't you get money?  From the Vatican?
Because we're
Um, I don't really know this one...
That's true, wouldn't that be great.  Of course, we never know when things are going to change.  Any one of us could be transferred to another convent, tomorrow.
What?
Keep moving!
Right to Hell.  Just kidding. Where is that bus?
Of course.  But it's almost lunch.
My what?
I am?
What?
Oh?
I'm a Christian.
Okay -- no limo.
What're you gonna do, put me in a bag and bury me?
Me too.
No.  Most of the time I'm thinking about you.  And now... you've really changed.
You re sort of... radiant.   your eyes are shining.  You're rea1ly different...
A hiding place.
Not... totally.
She's a broad!  Got it!  Just some broad!
We're losing it.
Which convent was that, Sister?
Yes -- two men -- and they had guns.
But where?
Okay, so the problem is still the nun outfit, right?
You are the blacksmith.  Ever shod a horse with a hoof this large?
You will stay at her side?
Pardon me?
Even though I have seen confessions pried from the lips of the accused, often quite literally?
Not Liberalism.  Equanimity.
I know it.
Now, hold the bowl steady.  Back to business.
Man or woman?
Business, best hidden is hidden best at night.
I need time for thinking.  Without you hanging on my coattails for a change.
Perhaps it is because your suitor's hands were recently very nearly wrapped around my throat.
The massive fellow... Brom.  For someone you call "friend," he misplaces a good portion of jealousy.
Which may explain his temperament. To have asked twice means the answer was "no" at least once.
No stone may be left unturned.  It may appear harsh...
You are not regarding it in full. The Widow Windsor had been run through by a sword.  I followed the bloodless wound, a wound whose path I could not comprehend till I had seen the Horseman with my own eyes.
The child she carried was eight months grown at least... near to birthing.  The sword had pierced its tiny heart exactly.
There was no blind stabbing.  This singular thrust found its target omnipotently, as if the Horseman made certain the unborn child died with its mother.
It was not butchery.
I have no solution for its meaning yet, but I could not just ignore it.
To avenge his father, and the others.
I'm drawing bad blood from the wound.
It is a prime tenet of science, Philipse, that because one thing appears improbable does not mean you embrace the utterly fantastical.
Yes.  Here...
May I see my mother?
She did not do it... please listen...
No, sir, please... she is innocent...
No.
Scooter, let's me and you go over to Dairy Queen and pick up a few things for lunchtime.
Karl's my name.
But honey, I'll be good. I promise. I love you sweetie. I'm just tryin' to help these two be part of things.
Yeah, honey, let the kid watch T.V. Hell, let's all watch T.V. like a family till your retarded friend and your homosexual friend gets here.
Sure. It sounded like a number one tune all right.
You're just crazy in a retarded kind of way then.  It wouldn't matter to me if you did do violence on somebody 'cause I ain't afraid of shit. You think I'm afraid for you to stay here. You're just a humped over retard it looks like to me. Not really, I'm just jokin' with you. Welcome to our humble home, buddy. Frank needs all the friends he can get. Frank's a real weak little kid. His daddy taught him how to be a pussy.
Yeah it is. Your name's Frank.
You told me to come by.
I ain't no good at it. I just come by.
All right then.
I dern near had me a touchdown till them boys got a-hold of me there so I figured I better give it off to you. I seen you over there follerin' me.
I don't know. He just said he'd eat out there.
Yeah.
Me, too.
I didn't aim to.
No ma'am.
So, you're really going to stay here?
Did you knock on the door yet?
How long have you been standing here?
Listen, before you get very used to staying here, I think you and I need to talk about a few things. Can I take you to lunch?
I mean tomorrow or the next day.
Okay, I'll come by Mr. Cox's and get you at noon.
Vaughan, don't get pushy.
Why?
You mean about y'all bein' together in "that" way?
I think everybody at the store knows that already. They always talk about it. Maureen Ledbetter told a awful story about why you ain't allowed over at the First Baptist Church no more.
Uh...  My friend over here would like a corned beef on rye and a ginger ale.
Help? Hmm. It's possible. What did you have in mind?
Hey, kid. You interested in a job? I just got word from your employment agency that you're looking for a position in retail sales.
That's a feather in your cap, man. The paper of record.
Christmas stories? Sure, I know a ton of 'em.
Good? Of course. Are you kidding?  I'll tell you what. Buy me lunch, my friend, and I'll tell you the best Christmas story you ever heard. How's that? And I guarantee every word of it is true.
Take over the register while I'm gone, okay, Jimmy? 
I don't have much choice, do I? It's pretty clear she doesn't want me around.
Yeah? And what else am I supposed to do? There's no baby anymore, and if she wants to throw away her life, that's her business.
Dream on, Auggie. She'll be lucky to make it to her nineteenth birthday.
I'd never be able to talk her into it. And even if I could, those things cost money. And that's just what I don't have. I'm flat out dead broke.
Are you calling me a liar? I'm telling you I'm broke. I don't even have insurance on my goddamned car.
Bully for you.
What difference does it make?
An ugly piece of hardware, isn't it?  I'll tell you what happened to my arm.  I'll tell you what happened.  Twelve years ago, God looked down on me and said, "Cyrus, you're a bad, stupid, selfish man. First of all, I'm going to fill your body with spirits, and then I'm going to put you behind the wheel of a car, and then I'm going to make you crash that car and kill the woman who loves you. But you, Cyrus, I'm going to let you live, because living is a lot worse than death. And just so you don't forget what you did to that poor girl, I'm going to rip off your arm and replace it with a hook. If I wanted to, I could rip off both your arms and both your legs, but I'm going to be merciful and just take off your left arm. Every time you look at your hook, I want you to remember what a bad, stupid, selfish man you are. Let that be a lesson to you, Cyrus, a warning to mend your ways."
I don't know. I try. Every day I keep on trying, but it's no easy task for a man to change his nature.  I'm off the booze, though. Haven't had a drop in six years. And now I've got me a wife. Doreen. Best damned woman I've ever known.  And a little boy, too. Cyrus Junior.  So things have definitely improved since I got fitted with this hook. If I can just turn this goddamn garage around, I'll be in pretty good shape.
That boy's one in a million. A real tiger.
Yeah? And why is that?
This is the first house I've been in without a TV.
But then you don't get to watch the ball games. You told me you were a Mets fan.
Nice drawing. Did you do that?
Yeah, I can believe it.
Is your father an artist?
He's dead?
Drawing's a good thing.
Yeah, sometimes.  I like to dabble, too.
Absolutely. We would be honored.
I was going to tell him ... but in my own time. In my own time... .
Carl Heine's type.
Tried to.  Defaulted on their payments.
A thousand.
Is that your third question?
You done your math right.
Of course not.  We're just not quick to run and boast.  In case something went wrong.
Why?  We're only talking.
Agnostics don't believe or disbelieve, Ma.  We just don't pretend we know.
And the next one...?
And the last...?
I'm sorry, was there a question in there?
He said he didn't want that life no more.  He'd been saving to buy a farm.  He was sorry I got sick. But pretty excited to get back his father's place.
Me and Smoltz came on dogwatch September 16.
You're wondering why I held it.
I'll take two.  One for later.
I think you like learning.
Yessir, there'd been real heavy fog.
Didn't think about it at the time. So no, it didn't strike me odd.
A little.  Yes.  You have to wonder.
Obviously.
The same.
If the head was moving fast enough, but I don't see how it could be.
Sure, anything's poss...
I already said that, b...
I...see.  I'm not sure I quite get your...point...
That's up to you field guys.  H.Q. wants you to break 'em in when you do the annual security sweep in January.
Such as?
Thank you ever so.
It's entirely mutual.
Those two musicians from the garage!
But, Joe - three weeks in Florida!  We could borrow some clothes from the girls in the chorus -
Now you're talking!  We pick up a couple of second-hand wigs - a little padding here and there - call ourselves Josephine and Geraldine -
The name is Josephine.  And it was your idea in the first place.
Boy, would I like to borrow a cup of that Sugar.
You tore it again!
Yes - you have to be very careful about picking a roommate.
Daphne got a proposal tonight.
We'll walk.  And if we have to, we'll starve.
Good night, honey.
Thank you, Daphne.
Now look, Daphne - hands off - I saw him first.
If I'd been watching my step, I never would have met him.  Wait till I tell Josephine.
Will she be surprised. I just can't wait to see her face -
Oh - here and there - and around.
Me too.  Bye now.
Thank you.  Aren't you a sweetheart?
Osgood - I can't get married in your mother's dress.  She and I - we' not built the same way.
Oh, no you don't!  Look, Osgood - I'm going to level with you. We can't get married at all.
Well, to begin with, I'm not a natural blonde.
And I smoke. I smoke all the time.
And I have a terrible past.  For three years now, I've been living with a saxophone player.
And I can never have children.
But you don't understand!  I'm a MAN!
Why?
I'm not doing anything.  I just thought I'd go home and have some cold pizza -
Yes, Joe.
My car?  Why, you -
If they catch me once more, they'll boot me out of the band.  You the replacement for the bass and the sax?
Good night, Sugar.
It's been delightful meeting you both.
If it's at all possible -
It's sort of funny - you being out of gas - I mean, Shell Oil and everything -
I have.  Spent six months in Vienna with Professor Freud - flat on my back -  - then there were the Mayo Brothers - and injections and hypnosis and mineral baths - if I weren't such a coward, I'd kill myself.
If I ever found a girl that could - I'd marry her like that.
I'm going to see him again tonight - and every night - I think he's going to propose to me - as soon as he gets up his nerve.
I come to the old lady's funeral.
That's because I've been on the wagon.
Where are they holding the wake? I'm supposed to be one of the pallbearers.
What is it, Spats?  What do you want here?
You don't owe me no nothing.
What? Why? What do you mean?
Whatever you do, dont mention Italy. Or politics. Or baby buggies.  Or Edith Piaf.
I was pretty hard on her last night.  And now shes getting married.
Trust me. This is bigger than Tony Pee-Pants.
Mom, please.
She did?
And you do now?
Kat, we must talk. This guy, theres something not quite right.
Is that why you brought him? Because of me.
Exactly. I want us to look like we fit, but not like were trying too hard to look like we fit.  Its welcome cocktails, not prom. With this level of matchy-matchy, we should be drinking peach schnapps under a bleacher somewhere.
Why?
Shampoo, got it!
I disappear. Its not about me.
Sure, but its never easy. They say theyre okay with it, and they are...for a while. Then one day, theyre not.
Hi.
Yes? No. What?  Save the patter for the tourists.
Of course, dont be silly.
Is there any other way to take it?
That's right--
My daddy likes to look into the dark, even when there ain't nothin to see -- it's what you hear he say.
It was too dark, Daddy.
I don't know, son -- they won't tell us things like that -- but I don't want y'all to come here no more.
Just do like I tell you -- I'll get word to you through the visitin' preacher.
Thank you, Daddy...
My father taught me...
Yes mam...
Good! But you don't have to tell the whole valley 'bout it! You'll get that woman in trouble!
Yes, ma'm...
They probly thought you was crazy.
What did the Lord tell you, Ike?
I shore could, Miss Rebecca.
I see, all right -- It's time for us to get out of this field.
It's lunchtime, and I wanna have a talk with you, Nathan Lee. Come on, children...
That's right, Mr. Garrison. The environment is what surrounds us. It is what we live and breathe.
But what are we going to do against this entire army?
Cuz, dummy they're Canadian, just like Ike!
Dude, they cut out 92 minutes!
No way.
Mkay, kids from all over the State have been brought here, because you all share the same problem. Uh, young man... Let's start with you.
A hunger strike? For what?
What?
Get everyone in hell ready. When the blood of Terrance and Phillip spills, the day is ours!
MOM!!!
Careful? Was my mother careful when she stabbed me in the heart with a clothes hanger while I was still in ze womb?
Yeah...
Totally!
Dude, I found the clitoris! I think I can get Wendy to like me now!
-Or monkey fucker-
Yes Principal Victoria.  The PTA is impeaching you.
You are officially relieved of your duties as principal of this school!
I sure did, Phillip!!
You did? Just now?
Do you always think about sex?  I'm talking about some very important stuff here!
Is sex the only thing that matters to you?
Listen guy, you're embarassing me in front of my friends!  You know how I get mad when I get embarassed.
Wendy?
Well get used to it, 'cause here we are, on the cruise of a lifetime.
They are awaiting further information.
There must be some mistake. You sure you hit the right commands?
Why don't you reset and run it again.  The pods check out ok.
Why yes Ryan, I am, and thanks for asking.  You don't have to talk to the intercom, I can hear you fine.
That's me.
Seems like they're cooperating. Hopefully I'll be out of here and on my way very soon.
Yeah, I know Bill, I came up with the plan remember?  Just have those hangar doors open and ready, I can take it from there.
I don't know.  I really haven't made up my mind yet.  We'll see how nicely they behave.
I don't have a problem with it. Besides, you get to meet a lot of interesting people.
Just considering our options... sir.
Look I know what I'm doing. I have experience and training in space walking.
Helllp!
Barnes?
I don't know.  Wave to them!
Baby, take it easy.
One moment please...  one moment please...
Nope.
Can I get you something for the road?
Orange who? Not from 'round here, are ya?
You afraid we're gonna steal it?
Nothing going on here, everybody stand back. Let him through, ladies. Ladies, please. As they start to move through the female throng, a little girl pops out in front of them, holding her ball.
Theo.
I'm not on the tour this year.
Well, Mr. Fazeli, the Bowling Congress says I'm a thorn in their side.
kissed a lotta tadpoles.  Listen, I been thinking about your problem. I'm not the guy to sponsor you. It would be unethical. But, there is something I could do for you.  Putt-putt golf.
I never saw you.
I'm goin' straight. No more short cuts. Theo gets into the car. Buzz leans in the open window.
I didn't mean that stuff I said. I was trying to keep you out of this muddle. I'm glad I didn't have my tubes tied. Oh, and by the way, I made a call for you before I - uh - retired. Buzz takes his card and scrawl on the back with a gold pen.
See ya 'round Maynard.
You shouldn't touch her.
Nobody touches her. Except me. I touch her. Sheila told me you played bouncy- bouncy with her.
He told me to play Blue-Face with Buzz. I like games.
You played bouncy-bouncy with Sheila, so I'm gonna play Blue-Face with you. 
You know who I am?
I heard you've been having a little trouble with the Congress.  Theo pulls his eyes off Sheila. Kastle walks Theo past pairs of bowlers.
Maybe I can help you.  Try a lighter ball, Penelope - you'll get hurt with that big ball, honey.  I've seen tapes of you bowling on the circuit. You got Fazeli blood running through you. Your pop was a genuine talent in his day.
It's nothing, just a slight business imbalance.  How's Gloria's thumb?
You still got the touch Junior.
Whips...orange whips.
How do you want it?  The eggs.
Coming right up.
Really? I kinda like it.
I think your brother may have already gotten to Buzz. He gets into his car.
I did your dirty work for you Sheila, now fuck off. Theo drives away leaving Sheila standing alone. She watches his car recede with a thoughtful expression, then turns on her heel.
Dwarf bowling's illegal.
Basic English?  There's no way this spacecraft was constructed on our planet.
But she's --
Now!
Something like that.  That doesn't surprise you?
As best we can estimate, it crashed four hundred years ago.
What do you mean, he's missing?
He's here somewhere.  Find him.  The sub's on it's way.  Go!  C'mon!
Jerry?  Please.  Stop this.
What the hell is going on here?
The what?
What -- you want me to retype it?
Considered what?  That it's American? How would you think it's American?
Give him a chance.  He's speaking our language, not the other way around.
Get this thing off me.
What?
What are you doing in the ship?  Beth?
Yeah, well, I get that way when I'm facing death and someone deserts me.
He what?
Something for burns.
I'm feeling better.
Don't you know?
It doesn't make any sense.
That's a hell of a mistake to make, Beth.
Yeah, I don't know how you could make that confusion.
Whatever I can do to help.
What noise?
You know what it is, Harry.
Shut up and catch.
You're not afraid of the water, are you, Norman?
Salt's good for you, Ted.  Helps you from getting impotent.
Just that.  Careful, it's heavy.
You mean a picture?
I don't see anything.
Please, Ted.
This is like nursery school.
The creature?
I'm Ben Kenobi.  Luke Starkiller here is leading our expedition.
... and I want you to start cleaning the equipment out of the scan- shielded compartments.
But you are... I know your 'Diary of the Clone Wars' by heart.  My father...
Yes... the Force... something horrible has happened.  I couldn't see what it was, or where it was, but it was terrible... terrible beyond description... the cry of millions dying at once.
But you always said things were so great at the academy... What happened?
At least you're doing something... I'd give anything to be in your position.
Chewbacca, it's time we showed them this isn't the regulation F8-88 Cargo Trawler.
Why?
Move out of the way!
There'll be time for that later. Now let's get out of here.
I know, sir, but it's the principle of the thing.
It's what I deserve.
I joined up for her. I wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for her. I'm a fool.
Yes, sir !
I gave him the impression that there was a fly crawling up my mom's leg. He is going to go eat it.
Don't you have to finish the game ?
Me, too... Day and Night-Cycle.
A funeral.
Yeah.
I don't know, Zander.
How do I know if this is love ?
Shhh ! Don't make him feel worse.
I'm glad you're doing so well. If they haven't made you squad leader by now, I'm sure you will.
We've gotta go get her !
Captain, we are in the path of an unidentified object moving at near light speed...
You got it.
Who gave you this idea ? It's that teacher. What's his name ? You know the one I mean.
Sorry. Carl's a fine boy...
Good luck. It's not there anymore.
I hope so. I hope you don't ruin your life over some silly little girl who wants to look handsome in a uniform.
Hey, just calm down, I'm giving the orders here-
Uni High Tigers, sir. Don't you remember ? I was captain of the team.
We're not leaving you here, sir !
Because V'ger is going to destroy all the carbon units on the third planet.
The information will not be disclosed.
V'ger is announcing that it has arrived, sir -- that it's ready to deliver the information it was programmed to collect...
It expects a return signal now, ordering it to transmit that information to the Creator.
No, Admiral. I don't think you are; not one damned bit. I remember when you recommended me for this command. You told me how envious you were, and if only you could find a way to get a starship command again. Well, sir, it looks like you found a way.
That thing is twenty hours from Earth. We know nothing about it yet.
That would presuppose a feeling, Commander... compassion. I sensed <U>no</U> emotion, only...  ... pure logic.
I would never take advantage of a sexually immature species.  You can assure him that's true, can't you?
Ten seconds....
Thrusters ahead, one third.
That inquiry invades my personal life, Captain.
Instruments fluctuating, Captain. Patterns unrecognizable.
Captain, I do not believe there <U>is</U> a crew -- or that this is a vessel as such.
That seems to be what it has planned -- to have the Creator physically present here.
<U>Urgent</U> signal from Starfleet, Captain!  <U>All</U> Earth defense systems have gone dead.
I beg your pardon?
Everyday things...yes.
I live there.
Surest thing you know.
I thought you had Play Practice.
Well, then, it don't look good for the Huskies...
Why?
What?
That's why we filmfolk get along so well with you farmers.  Both up with the chickens.
What is it, a surprise?
Courthouse back in town.
What?
Town in New Hampshire was small town America too.  Forty thousand dollars a day, to shoot on the street.  And <u>then</u> they kicked us out...
...I was just talking to that girl in the other room.
I never touched her.  My mother's gr...
I...
I just don't know what <u>order</u> they come in...
Then what is the...?
She came in here, wait, she...I was giving her a massage...wait...Wait!  She came in here...she...  ...with respect...she took off her clothes, and she got in <u>bed</u>, I told her I could not--we don't know each other, you see...
I told her Thank You Very Much, but it was inconvenient because...uh... because...
I know, I know.
Who got their heads cut?
You said <u>three</u>...?
I'd prefer it if you didn't speak to me.
...you know, there's nothing you could say, that could <u>possibly</u> make a difference, so, why don't you just save your breath.
I don't know what she's bitching about, she's flashed her tits in the last five movies...she'd bare her breasts to do a <u>voice</u> over.
I don't drink.
I really don't think you should be talking this way to a lady.
Later for that, Walt, let's get this:  we need the "pages" for the new "Old Mill"...alright?  We need a new title, we need a...
You tell me what to do, I'll do it.
No, I'm serious, election's coming up, a lot of people are pretty upset...
I hate the crayon Burnt Sienna and people who spit when they walk.
Well, he's not president anymore, so why be petty.
What are you gonna talk about?
Then why are you putting on mascara?
But you only wore mascara when you and Daddy went on romantic dates...
Or blush.  You look pale.
Where's Rache?  It's <u>Thursday</u>, we get to be with <u>Rache</u>!
Maybe twenty.
Absolutely Duncan I'm on top of everything.
I <u>killed</u> my math quiz, A-minus.
But Rache...
Then have a donut --
Alright starve.
Doo-wop-doo-doo, <u>doo</u>-wop-doo-doo...
Where are you, anyway?
That's Rache's song!
No, it isn't.  Because it isn't everything.  And we want every- thing, don't we?
We don't KNOW if you've got it, we haven't SEEN it yet!  Now go back and FINISH!
You're WHERE?
Jackie, <u>we</u> were taking them water- skiing for the <u>whole</u> weekend!
No.  You think this is going to help the kids then you do it.  You're on your own.
...a ridiculously <u>expensive</u> and <u>inappropriate</u> item, which her father and I have already <u>told</u> her she is <u>far</u> too young to own.  But <u>you</u> apparently want to <u>buy</u> her forgiveness, with...
You're not terribly good at taking care of h...
Those are <u>my</u> children you're practicing on.  They deserve <u>first-</u> rate care.  Every minute.  Of every night.  And every day.
Hey, any help you need, we'll cover.
How the hell would you know?
How would you know <u>anything</u>?
Beats me.  Ask your mom.
...go to the park.  In the worst way.
Are we.
Don't be too sure.
Neutral ground.  What's up?
Just want to be a little sharper. For a few minutes.
I think so...What do you think?
You took a fishing trip with the boys. Liked it so much, you took another.
...while she watched the kids.  Then, you booked this flat in Paris for your family's summer.  But she said...
Maybe he's gay.
What if he is?
Yes, Mikey?
Yes.
Four brothers and five sisters.
It was God's will.
No.
Yes, Mikey?
What?
But then, in a sense, since you would never have met Dad if your family had stayed in Europe...if it weren't for Hitler, none of us would have been born.
Yeah...How do we know we won't be exploited?
Tired of this shit...
Good.  'Cause I...um...I really agreed with everything you had to say last week about how bad my story was...
And I also agreed with what you said today about Marcus's story. It is a piece of shit.
Hunh.
Uh, yeah, we're getting there.
Sureumyeah, as soon as I have a screening I'll let you know.
I'm not arguing.  I'm just telling you what the deal is--Congresswoman.
What happened?
Are you going to kill us?
Chemco's been developing nerve gas?
We're secured.  Takeover team is in position and accounted for.
We've...been developing a product... KZ 70709.
That's preposterous!  We have no such program!
The report is entirely untrue.  I can assure you of that.
See!  See, I told you.
General Schmuck?
Yes?
I am aware of what a condition red alert implies.
That's a very wise deduction, General.
Because I thought it proper, Major.  Why else would you think I'd do it?
Well, for the same reasons we do, sir. Don't you see?
Gee, sir, that last remark doesn't exactly make all the sense in the world.
Well, I'm not, sir.  Honestly, sir.
Don't you think he knows something about this, General Ripper?
But, General, we're on our toes.  We haven't agreed to anything for years.  Inffact, a a lot of people say we never will.
If they gave us what we think we need, yes, I guess we would.
General, what's good enough for the President and all the experts he's got working on the thing, is good enough for me.
No, sir.  I'm sure we wouldn't.
Look, sir.  I'm no expert on the subject, but I've read some pretty sharp ideas the big boys have.  Like, say, both countries agreeing to a million dollar reward and international protection for anyone who gives evidence of cheating to the inspectors. You can't hide those things without a lot of people knowing about it.  And if I were going to try and hide a few, I wouldn't want to depend on the fact that some poor slob isn't going to run and blab for a million bucks.  We're as smart as they are, and if they cheat, or even hold back information, we'd pull right out.
They're coming in now.
I'm not certain, Mister President.  The boys in CONCOM do the pencil work.
Lothar, take your checks now.
Roger, keep calling them.  Knock off auto-pilot, Ace.
Yeah?
Forget it.
Everything still checks out okay.
But the code is made up by General Ripper, and he's the only one left at the base who would know the code.
Come on, King.  That doesn't make sense.
But they couldn't come out for a hundred years!
Was it okay?
What did you guys think?
Behind me. I'm making these slides out of these old pictures and paintings and stuff.
Buff, that slice is the difference between life and death for some half-dead Bangladeshi.
You should get upset. Everyone should get upset. When, when Hitler was greasing the Jews, people were saying, "Don't get me upset. Your bumming me out." My duty as a human being is to be pissed off. Jesus Christ, not that it makes a difference on the first fucking place. Nothing ever changes, man. Fifty years from now we're all gonna be dead and there'll be new people standing here drinking beer, eating pizza, bitching and moaning about the price of Oreos, and they won't even know we were ever here. And then fifty years after that those suckers will be dust and bones and there'll be all these generations of suckers trying to figure out what they're doing on this fucking planet and they'll all be full of shit. It's all so fucking futile.
... idiot! Open the damn door! Go, go, go, come on!
Come on.
Mm. You know, does he tell you about how, uh, Jeff, Pony, started the band...?
Yeah.
This is private property, my friend.
See, I wrote something about all this. Uh, it, it's a song about...
I'll be in the car, okay?
Taking care of business.
Mm-mm.
Right on. You know what? He doesn't need the limo, man.
Okay, great. Well, now he's crying. Are you guys happy?
That, that's Indian?
I hate that.
No. I'm not going to the van, it's so gross. Come on. I'm doing my performance right now.
It was just something that got out of hand. Did anyone get hurt?
Okay, but nothing happened. Believe me, if I thought something really bad was going to happen, I would've done something.
Yeah.
I would've stopped it.
I don't know. I would've done something. This is kind of hypothetical, isn't it? This place is so stupid. I can't believe we're sitting here in this mosh-pit of consumerism. With all these people eating their chunks of dead flesh...
... like fucking robots. Look at those kids there.
Sooze.
Wait. What, what are you saying?
Well, what about us?
No, maybe not though. That, that's what I'm trying to say.
Oh, no, no, no.
Wait, no, I... Look, Sooze, I figured something out.
Oh, fuck it, man!
No, no, they, uh, you know, that can be kind of a hassle, so , uh, you know, I just stay at the Four Seasons. It's easier.
Camel jockey.
Yeah, yeah. That's the fucking problem.
Yeah.
Yeah, but sometimes I try to figure out why I left in the first place, you know? I think about people and I wonder what they're doing.
I think about you. I mean, a lot.
Yeah, I have, I have, yeah.
Or the future, oh, no, no, I mean... I mean, we'll be working on that album cover, right?
You do?
What are you? Her pimp? She said she might go get a drink first.
Pal, she's a big girl, you know? I'm sure she's alright.
About what?
She didn't say. Maybe she's at the bar at the hotel.
Well, Dad, she said she wanted to suck my cock.
Hey, Tim, you know what? You win.
You have the largest penis. Can we go please?
You piece-a-shit bug zapper!
Everything's fine.  I'm just having a little trouble keeping my frown upside down.
And they get caught!
But we agreed your job is running the baby machine...
Ah!  I almost forgot gas for the baby machine.  I'll grab your Snickers and get a place in line.
He is the Great One...
Remember, Kansas, every time you point a finger you've got three more pointing back at you.
That you?
Just call me later.  I gotta get some smokes for Grandma.
For a pack of cigs?  I use her food stamps.
That's okay, Hannah.  It was silly to think we could learn to rob a bank from watching movies.  Sex - you can learn from movies.  But robberies?  There's no way.
Hold up, hold up.  Any sentence that starts with "at church camp" ain't leading to the big "O."
Oh, Jesus Christ, Mom!  Like my life ain't a great big pile-of-shit 'cause you're in here?  Now I have to add, "P.S. My mom's a dyke" too?
Hey, don't "mouthy shit" me - I'm outta here.
Where's the bar?
I'm sorry, Mr. Gillis, but I just don't think it's any good. I found it flat and banal.
Where's the story? I bluffed it out with a few notions of my own. It's really just a springboard. It needs work.
I've got twenty pages of notes. I've got a pretty good character for the man.
What were you -- a child actress?
Second generation, huh?
Nice job.
Saddest thing I ever heard.
Come clean, Betty.  At night you weep for those lost closeups, those gala openings...
Three cheers for Betty Schaefer! I will now kiss that nose of yours.
Lots of people were.  Lindbergh had just landed in Paris.  Come on in.
Yeah?
Why?
I've lost my car.
It is to me.  That's why I came to this house.  That's why I took this job -- ghost writing!
Come midnight, how about blind- folding the orchestra and smash- ing champagne glasses on Max's head?
A little.
What's that?
Nothing is the matter.  I'm having a great time.  Show me some more.
No, they don't.
He was trying to spare your feelings. The studio wanted to rent your car.
De Mille didn't have the heart to tell you.  None of us has had the heart.
You tell her, Max.  Come on, do her that favor.  Tell her there isn't going to be any picture -- there aren't any fan letters, except the ones you write yourself.
I'm not here.
Good.
What car?
Okay.  And let's have the car right outside.
It couldn't be helped. The city will have to make do with three.
The Guardians will be angry. They may even send me to the Phantom Zone. You see, I didn't really have permission to borrow it. I must go explain to them...
Eliminate her.
You can do it. You're the most powerful woman on Earth.
It's a warning, that's for sure.
There's no such thing as an accident. Everything has meaning, if you can read the signs.
What do you feel about me?
I don't see why not.
Feelings are real. Once you've had them, they're yours forever.
Do you want to come to Argo City?
You can't escape from me that easily. I'm afraid you don't know who I am.
Don't think I'm weak, just because I'm a woman. I have Power. Give in, stop fighting me, Ethan. I always get what I want.
Why George, are you proposing?
George---I thought you'd never ask.
Oh, sure.
Can you create life?
Oh, I don't know. I'm not signed out for an overnight.
It doesn't seem right.
What? Me?
We are in great danger. A being has come to Earth with powers far beyond those of anyone member of the Craft.
It's everywhere. But water is always the door.
If there's a way in, there must be a way out.
Buddy, are we in trouble.
The kid needs a man to show him --
Hey, he'll be all right. Believe me Lana, I know. I was a late bloomer myself.
But all he had was chocolate milk.
Me too. That's why I put this one up.
We get together sometimes.
Gus Gorman.
Or socks.
'Cause I know about getting' them half-centses?
Yeah, yeah, I can do it.
First question got to be "Where."
Not "What." Don't need a genius to figure out "what." Need a genius to figure out "where."  He says I'm a genius, your don --  Brother! Bubba! Your Bubba!  See, if y'all don't want them to trace it back, you got to punch this in from someplace nobody'd ever think off. Some little rinky- dink operation with a little mickey- mouse computer. ROSS It's got to be someplace you can sneak into.
Don't be getting' racist with me, man.
Fair's fair.
Sister! I'm his sister!
We've already met.
I'm sorry, I'm in a real hurry.  See you around, pal.
I'm in no rush.  So what do you have in mind?
Gus?
Missing????
Today coffee----
Don't bet on it!
Really?
Listen, I've got to give you credit. Your disguise is nearly perfect. I mean, if you fooled me, and I am nobody's fool --
Do you . . . ah . . . want to step outside?
Lois, I really don't see why --
Why am I doing this? Why am I here?
Now This I want to hear.
My kind of people.
Sensible enough.
No possibility for parole?
I asked the right question.
I didn't ask her anything . . .
Like it? It's magnificent!  Not that it couldn't use a woman's touch. Especially around dinner time.
Where is his home, Lex Luthor? Which way?
What shall we do now?
This is Metropolis after hours! This is what you'll be writing about. C'mon, let's dance.
. . . Let me get my purse.
You always overreact, Clark. How terrible can it be?
Gee guys, that's swell of you. But  . . . I've got another idea.
I'd just like to have a little less sensationalism.
Our other dinner guest.
He's . . .  beautiful. Perfect.
You are . . .
You are . . . nothing. I am father now.
I'll ignore that . . . So, I created a monster who didn't work nearly as well as I might have liked -- you were clearly his better  --  he needed more energy, more power.
Precisely. And then it came to me. My greatest ever plan. I made a deal with some minor league Bad Boys. Arms Dealers, Renegades Generals, You know the type. With you gone, we'll make a fortune rearming the world.
Nobody wants war. I'd just like to keep the threat alive.
We're running out of smoke.
I know son, I know...
He may have a gun!
Help! I mean  --  I can't stop saying it. Silly, isn't it  -  There's nothing to worry about. Help! See.
Screaming
He wants to see you. Lex Luthor.
The way you describe him doesn't really do him justice.
Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen.,
We just take it?
The least we can do is leave him another door jam.
Not exactly. But it's his kind of neighborhood.
On the salary he pays me, I can't make my rent without it.
It does, huh?  Clark Kent, I'd like you to meet Lois Lane.
Pink.
You mean bullets and fire and all that can't hurt him, but this kind of rock --
--  Dropped into the sea!  Bye-bye California! Hello, new West Coast! Gold Coast! My Coast.  And now...well...  I left my heart in San Francisco...
Are you still in touch?
Which one?
Which clinic?
Sunnyridge.  That was a long time
Why are you telling me this?
Well, Sam, I might as well tell you the truth.  It's this lawsuit you've gotten yourself all involved with. I want you to drop the damned thing.
Tomorrow I'm going to put Sean on the bus.  He won't want to go.  He never does.  He'll cry and want to hold on to me.
From what?
Did he have any particular problems that you knew of?  Financial pressures...run-ins with the law...
You talked about it?
Why would he be frightened?
Yes.  It's a present.
No.  From Mr. Stephens.  That was him on the phone just now.  He was calling to see how you were.
You hate that.
Thank you, Nicole.
Tell me about it.
Almost three.
Perfect.
Thanks.
I'm afraid this meat is overdone.
What is it?
Any criminal record?
Can't get off that shitty dump they live on.  What little money comes in goes to booze.
Don't know.  Food banks, welfare, church charity.  They scrape by.
I told you I was positive.  The speedometer was large and easy to see from where I was.
Oh.  I better get some spackle.
Yeah, right.
Thanks, I see him...
See my mother?
Hurry back.
Why?
Did Sidney tell you about it?
No...
I don't believe it.
I don't?
I'll listen one more minute.
Sure, he steams her up - wants her to stand on her own two feet and all that jazz!
Presumably yours...  That's according to St. Dallas.
Integrity - acute, like indigestion.
A pocket fulla firecrackers - looking for a match!  It's a new wrinkle to tell the truth... I never thought I'd make a killing on some guy's "integrity".
You're incapable of the truth...
Let's wait till Christmas - it's more legitimate then.
What kind of an act is this?
I'm used to you...
Well, I'll tell you what - excuse me for breathing, will ya?  How do you like it?  He comes to my office and -
Frankly, yes, to my surprise.  He thinks he's very gifted - those boys'll go a big mile, he thinks.
What do you do for that hundred a week.  Fall out of bed?
Joan, call a cop!  We'll arrest this kid for larceny!
Well, maybe I was wrong, too... But there's no doubt, Susie, that we have to face some serious things...
But you didn't do much about it, Susie.  You walked out, and there I was...solo...and not too good at that.
Susie, I was there for OUR sake, too.  But what a world it would be if we were all afraid to learn to walk and talk because it might offend poppa!  By the way, I think your brother was completely responsible for the smears...
What chip?
We have to leave the city, immediately.  And avoid the authorities.
Negative.  The T-1000 will definitely try to reacquire you there.
I would.
Why?
Why?
Yeah, I thought you'd like this place.
Terminated.
I couldn't... oh, God.  You... came here... to stop me?
And what it that?
Doesn't want you thinking too much, huh?
I'm sure it feels very real to you --
Relax now, Sarah --
Some.
Your manner.
There have been messages for you.  A Lieutenant David Wills called from the Allied Kommandatura Cultural Affairs office in Wiesbaden. I don't know who he is.
I don't remember in detail, there were so many.
I may have, as... as I said, I simply don't remember.
I'll tell you why. You remember we talked about you playing for Hitler's birthday?  And you told me that Goebbels got to your doctors first, that you were tricked?
Me? Never.  Never.
I was a member of the Communist Party. I was a communist. That's what Hinkel had over me. He knew everything. He held that over me. That's how he made me co-operate.
You don't know what it's like to wake up every single morning of your life terrified, you don't know that - 
Yes.
I don't know what you mean, Major.
I won't let the fat kid down.
We will, kiddo.
The what?
Okay.  Talk some more.
About where you're from.
Nitroglycerin, basically. Bit more stable.  I learned howto make it when I was a kid.
We did it, Kyle.  We got it.
Lieutenant, are you sure it's them?  Maybe I should see the ...bodies.
Suspect westbound on Olympic.  Grey sedan.  Has hostage, repeat...
Please, don't do that...
Hold on...  They want your driver's license number.
It's not like anyone could actually open it.
Hm?  Oh, yes.
What's wrong?
I don't...
Who the fuck cares?
... what... ?
They'll be wanting it back.
Which grad-school?
You're part of it...
There's nothing to forgive.
Of course, Nick...
You mean, I don't like it, he doesn't pay?
You mean, <u>dis</u>satisfied.
I can't tell you how <u>not</u> interested I am.
Don't take another step.
He came to my mind recently, that's all.
Why are you following me?
You're joking.
Come on.  These are the typically sentimental gestures of a depraved industrialist.
Do we still get paid for the week?
You don't really believe it's haunted... Do you believe in ghosts?
All night?
You want company?
Yes, because someone was always keeping me awake.  Ever since I was little.  That was my job.  I took care of my mother and I had to be there for her all night long, and she woke up all the time.  And after she died, well, it's been a few months, but I still, I still wake up, it's... a habit.  I know we've only known each other a couple of hours, but I'm really glad to be with people who let me talk about this.  I'm really happy to be here with you.
I don't know.  A lullaby I guess. My mother used to hum it to me. And her mother before that, and so on.  Hugh Crain, would you care to dance?
Test it.
How could you do this to people?
Why'd she kill herself?
She was unhappy.
Can't say.  Haven't been here that long.  Well, it's Labor Day, gotta get to work.
The Taj Mahal wasn't a palace, it was a tomb.  Why didn't he tell us?
There's hundreds of them.  This must be a record of the children who died at the mills, like Luke said.
Carolyn showed me where she hid him, hid him with all the ones he killed --
I'm a gracious host.
Heavier than that now.  But are there any drugs in that stomach to back up your story.
And where is this guest?  Don't they want to interview him.
Huh?
She didn't write to me, did she.
Who'd Jenny get it off of -- this grass or whatever?
I think you didn't get that lot in the Navy, doing your National Service.
Nick's a nick, n' it?  No matter what state you're in.  State of remorse, most likely -- for gettin' caught.
Those aren't guards.  They're valets.
No, but I know what he means.
She never told Eddie, though.
How'd you manage that, then.
Yeah, well, she started all that in London.
Learnin' 'ow to speak proper.  Central School of Speech and Drama. It's no doddle gettin' in there, y'know. At seventeen.  They offered her a place at RADA n' all, only she'd've had to wait till the next session and she was always in hurry to get on, was Jenny.  She could talk posh without any training, when she was knee-high to a grasshopper.  Show up the old man, you know.
She told you all about my details but not about his.  Lovely.
She never would have turned you in, not in a million years.
Where else?
I doubt it.
That's right, your life is Shit, and I'm to blame.  It's that simple.
It's OK, I guess. No, I don't really. I'm not big on music, ordinarily.
...Uh-huh.
Ah... it's nothing.
Huh.
Huh. Yeah. Maybe...
Uh--
That right.
Huh.
Uh-huh.
But it's...
Nah, go ahead. I'm not big on parties.
Honey...
I tried to tell him the whole story, but Riedenschneider stopped me. He said the story made his head hurt, and anyway he didn't see any way of using it without putting me on the hot seat for the murder of Big Dave...
Haven't I seen you up in ladies' wear?
Uh-huh. Some beat, huh?
Check out the rack on that broad in the angora.
OK.
...Nah.
My name is Diedrickson. County medical examiner.
He said OK. Is that what he said?
If you like them, they're for sale. Another day like yesterday and half the collection will be on the block.
We've been operating in the red for years.  That was the whole idea behind the Superstition Exhibit.  It was designed to pull people in. We've spent every penny we have on advance publicity, betting everything on the opening's success. If we postpone at the last minute... No.  I don't want to think about that.
Like hell!
No.  I think what we've got here is a psychotic killer wielding some kind of unusual weapon... who wants us to believe he's a monster.
May I see that?
Dr. John Whittlesley.
I don't know.  I thought Dr. Whittlesley died in South America.
A blow dart.  Seed pods.  A plant press.  Pretty unimpressive stuff.
We can't.  We've managed to get inside the one place that's safe.  I think we should sit tight and wait for reinforcements.  If we go outside, we're risking more lives. You have to accept it, Margo, there's nothing we can do.  The building must be swarming with police by now.  It won't take long for them to get through the doors.
I don't believe it.
Like this.
Another storage room.
What kind of hormones?
I'm not sure.  We should split up. You take that hall and I'll take this one.
Unlock one of the other storage rooms.  We're going upstairs.  We'll leave a trail back to 1012 and try to trap the monster in here.
Listen to me, Pendergast.  Mbwun's DNA is part homo sapien.  In primates, the eye is a direct path to the brain!  If you get a clean shot, there's only one place you can kill it.  Shoot it in the eye!
He gave it back to his father.
But how do you account for the popularity of those eight hours a day when Truman sleeps?
Let's go to some of those viewers' calls.
Truman, I've watched you your whole life. I saw you take your first step, your first word, your first kiss.  I know you better than you know yourself.  You're not going to walk out that door--
Yeah?  Outta what?
Truman, you're gonna be late!
I made macaroni.
There's been an accident, Truman.
Well, I made it through another night.
Oh, just so.
Yeah.
I apologize for making you wait -- I've brought some new evidence with me --
We have a situation. The members are assembling.
Show you right on a map.
Not according to the men in blue.
They want to discredit you -- for what?
You mean that apocalyptic trash you write? I knew your name was familiar. I just didn't know why.
Dr. Kurtzweil, I'm not interested in bigoted ideas about race or genocide. I don't believe in the Elders of Zion, the Knights Templar, the Bilderburg Group or in a oneworld Jew run government --
The element of surprise, Scully. Random acts of unpredictability. If we fail to anticipate the unforeseen or expect the unexpected in a universe of infinite possibilities, we find ourselves at the mercy of anyone or anything that cannot be programmed, categorized or easily referenced...
Mulder. Move away from the door. We're coming through it.
I'd been told as much.
I don't know. But I have a hunch what you're going to find here isn't anything that can be categorized or easily referenced.
We're being blamed for these deaths. Scully, I want to know what this man died of. Don't you?
This is great. This is fitting.
You can't quit, Scully.
We're close to something here -- we're on the verge --
After what you saw last night -- after all you've seen -- you can't just walk away --
Just like that --
I need you on this, Scully --
I don't know anything about that.
I don't have his number.
About the conspiracy?
I want to know where Scully is.
The geometry of mass infection presents certain conceptual re-evaluations for us. About our place in their Colonization.
Shush.
Four and twenty blackbirds...
Peter, okay?
Little boy?!  That's him!
No problem.
Pump in two liters of pure oxygen, please Henry.
Absolutely.
Pregnant.  Thanks for asking.
Das mussen sie doch wissen. Ich meine ohne grund wird die politzei doch nicht ins Hans komme Fraulein Schmidt, ein schande...
That was the man that brought me some money when Harry died. He said Harry had been anxious at the last moment.
Yes. He moved his head, but the rest is good, isn't it?
Where is she?
A parrot...Let it go.
Can you imagine a parrot nipping a man?
I shall be all right.
Yes.
What did you say? I'm sorry...
No, not yet.
What?
Best thing that ever happened...
You're not locking her up?
I'm not asking you to.
I'll do what I can, if she'll let me.
Please hurry up - just get him on the telephone.
No, I don't know...
It is, and I'm gunning just the same way for your Major Callaghan.
Well, well, they seem to've been giving you quite some busy time.
Yes.
Talk to me?...Of course...Come on...
I remember when they raided the gambling joint - you know a safe way out...
Only his doctor, Dr. Winkel.
Hear the details.
What's he saying?
Not the sort of thing I should confess to a total stranger, but you have to break the rules sometimes. Humanity's duty.
Yes.
Yeah, that's right. Now could you be quiet so I can get some sleep.
Look I don't care about the money right now: I just want some sleep. So if you could be quiet -
Thanks.
We're ok.
Not too bad.
Woman bites chicken leg, turns out to be a mouse. Or a rat. It's an urban myth.
So?
Uh-huh.
What??
That's a movie, you moron.
How come you don't know it?  How can you say you hate the Jews when you don't know anything about --
No, you don't.... If you hated them, you'd study them, so you'd know why you hate them. You know what tefillin is? Tsitsis? Shotness? You know the kaddish from the kiddush?  Eichmann? He went to Israel. He studied the Torah, the Talmud, the Mishnah, the whole bit. He hated Jews.
Yes, I am. Basically I am.
Why?
Hebrew's very difficult. It would take years.
Lina, come here!
Did you see how they reacted to him?
It's a romantic movement, Curtis. It always has been.
That doesn't seem to be happening, does it?
To hear them read Torah.
That doesn't mean I don't like hearing it.
Fine.
Her place is down the road. But she just comes out for weekends sometimes.
Keep driving. Don't slow down.
Why me?
"Do chickens give milk?"
I was just trying to make a point. If --
Very much, I think.  But, there's going to be a problem.
Johana Cross, pleased to meet you.  Well!  Isn't this a coincidence. I really wasn't expecting this... All the way out here.  It's incredible!
Congratulations, Enzo.
The fool was asleep!  If I weren't around, he'd already be dead!!! Is that who you want to live with?
"That"!  This is not a "that"...
What room have you got?
You don't have a room?  Paolo?  What did I just hear?  I personally called you to reserve a room for my good friend Jacques Mayol and you treat him like a stranger?!
Not only is Jacques Mayol a very special friend, but he happens to be one of the best divers in the world!  And you're throwing him out!  Are you crazy, or what? Stupido!
Then, it's very chic.  Avanti!
Yes.
No.  Thank you.  It's really beautiful.
... I was right about what?
I don't know... why?
Uh... Yes, of course!
Uncle Louis.  He's a 75 year old amazing guy, isn't he?
... Are you sure?
Louis, we were French!
Those are the divers who go down 300 to 330 feet.  They dive with a Helium-oxygen mixture.  At that depth, compressed air is too dangerous because it contains carbon dioxide.
That isn't for the divers actually. It's for the balloon.  It blows up and pulls the diver up like an elevator.  Without it, with the pressure at the bottom, the diver would just stay pinned to the sea bed.
Yes... It's magic.
I got the job done didn't I? I did what I had to do.
Hey, it's your Bar Mitzvah. I'm just readin' the Torah portion.
He's...he's very nice.  But Mrs. Carver, the fate of Hanukkah rests solely in his hands. Please, you have to help me.
Now we wait for Santa to make his next move.
No. It's not like that. You're being completely neurotic. I was just playing along...
Mom, why don't you put that cat out of its misery?
I'm back on the job for the JDL. You hear about that crazy white boy who took over as Santa?
The alarm will trigger if the system detects any Non-W.A.S.P. tendencies inside the building. For example, if you were to dribble a basketball, or eat watermelon, or use the word dawg...that is, spelled with an aw as opposed to the letter o...within the confines of this workshop, the alarm would sound.
Hah! Jewish guilt. Well, it won't work on me Hammer. I'm too strong for it.
Resting?
What about me?
Yes, I was drunk, Mr. Manning.
What are you doing that for?
I bet you try on my coffin some day -- I hope it "fits just perfect."
More or less.
No.
Not! I tell you. No!
I didn't do anything. She screamed. Something frightened her.
It's better you don't know.
Why do yo&amp;i accuse me? You don't know what you're doing -- you don't understand -- nobody understands --
Thanks, Sheriff.
Offend a reputable citizen and involve the department in a slander suit? No. I'm in office to protect the taxpayers money  not throw it way. Come on, Charlie.
And not a sign of the leopard?
You're positive of that, aren't you?
Could I speak to Carlos or Deborah?
When will they be back?
The question now is whether or not your brother still owns anything, Mrs De Moraes.
Excuse me?
Perhaps I should come back when youre...
Yes... You woke me up... Its the middle of the night here. Have you found Mr Friedman?
Paul Lamont...?
My brother hung himself.
Leon hung himself.
Leon hung himself...
Leon hung himself...
The dead can wait.
French people need a visa to enter this country. That takes time and I didnt have any. I used a British passport. My names not Lamont but Lombard. Xavier Lombard.
Thank you. But I think Ill go to bed. Its been a long day.
Yeah. Goodnight, Emily.
You cannot walk away from this. You cannot.
You... Fuck you!
How are you, Jane?
No.
Good.
I hope its not too significant.
Well, I would have to point out that we could have dealt with that question when you called this morning, Mrs Spitz. I wouldnt like to think Id kept you waiting for nothing.
Anything at all?
Huh... Im sure thered be lots of takers.
No. Thank you. Could you tell me if Leon Spitz is here, please?
Left? When? I just come from his place and there was no one there. A neighbour of his...
Oh. This is... Wed arranged to meet tonight and Im due to return to Paris tomorrow...
Yes. You wouldnt know where I could reach him? We had to discuss an exhibition of his photographs at my Paris gallery, you see? I really need to see him before I leave.
Yes. Three thousand pounds. I still...
... No.
... No. In fact, Id seen him a couple of months earlier. He was quite depressed. His work wasnt getting anywhere. He said he was going to try something new, realism, London in the nineties - documentary stuff, you know...
O est pass ton salon?
Eh bien... Tes sr que tas besoin de moi?  La petite ma lair assez bien foutue, non?
Salut, Laurent. Ouais. It wasnt easy but I got what you wanted through Interpol. Say, whats your business with these Spitzes?
It appears that in their younger days they were actively involved with a shady German group of Nazi hunters known as Never Forget. Over the years were talking about a dozen or so execution-type killings.
Their last suspected kill occurred two years back, though your Spitzes now probably do no more than bankroll the group. Still, Id watch my step. These people are well-connected, Laurent; former Israeli prime minister, etc. The ladys also president of an international Zionist organisation... Anyway, you get the picture.
Its a good guess...
Tremoille... don't.  Please...
They've started the battle without me!
Tell me...
I'm staying, Jean.
I'm not afraid of the fire anymore. It will purify me...
Performing a miracle.
No no, I'm fine, really...
And you be careful, you who claim to be my judges, for you too will be judged one day...!
And you?  Why did you lie?  You promised I could be confessed...
It's not my body I want to save. It's my soul.
He said that I have to save France from her enemies and give her back to God, and He told me that I -- Jeanne -- will lead you to the altar at Rheims to be crowned King of France.
Noooo!
Jeanne, you have to understand -- it's not easy for us -- I mean for our pride -- to suddenly be usurped by a -- well, with all due respect, by a... girl.
Jeanne, put yourself in my shoes for a moment -- how would you feel, if you were me?
Damn right!
I know, but so is the enemy -- they're falling back -- Paris is ours...!
So... bring up the reinforcements!
They will -- and so will you if you go on swearing like that.
We still believe in you, Jeanne.  If it were up to me, I'd chase every goddamn Englishman into the ocean. But it's not up to us anymore -- it's up to the king...
What are you doing here?  Please... leave... you can't stay here...
Yes!
I don't think so.
Yes... of course... when you don't need me anymore.
And what does he say to you?
I came specially to meet you today. I love your playing, but what a day to choose.
My name's Dorota, I'm Jurek's sister. oh! You're bleeding.
Christmas.  This is not a good time to have children. But then...
What, I'm working, what?
Warsaw's not the only radio station.
'If you prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you poison us, do we not die? And if you wrong us, shall we not revenge?'
What d'you think I mean, Kitten? I forgot, that's what I mean.
I treat you like dirt because you are dirt.
Cow!
Bitch!
You're a dirty pig!
Stop it, Wladek.
I've got another one.  Warmer.  What will you do when it's all over?
Tell me your name. I'll listen out for you.
Szpilman.  Good name for a pianist.
Certainly, there is nothing so easy to like as a pet and they are quite silent.
I'll be back.
Nothing just yet
She says, throw the piano overboard.
Tomorrow.
At the finish, it's Single Action by two, Fasanella second, Visitation third.  Line on Single Action... 3 to 2. Hell with it, that's no good.
I had some appointments.
All of it.
I checked the place out.  There weren't no dicks in there.
What's eatin' you?  I've blown money before.
You think my play is bad?
Aw come on, it was the only thing to do.  He knew he was holdin' ya back.
You ain't gonna have nothin' if you don't lay off them games of chance. There's a depression on ya know.
If you saved a little, you wouldn't have to grift so much.
You could buy yourself some things. Clothes, or a nice car...
Forget it.
All we need is the bookie setup for now.  We'll worry about the telegraph office later.
C'mon, you can do better than that. We ain't no heel grifters.
Just give us what ya can, Benny. We'll send a truck down.
Let him wait.
All we need is a couple days, Henry. A couple days and we'll get Lonnegan down and stomp on 'em.
A couple days; that's all I'm askin'.  I can stay clear that long.
If we're lucky, this'll bring him back stronger than ever.
Raise 500.
What for?  I haven't done anything.
Yes, a ticket to Chicago.
You know me.  I'm just like you... It's two in the morning and I don't know nobody.
Naw, he picked up some jane in the bar.  Can't see him till morning anyway.
Had a little fight with a raggle down on 13th.  She got me with her ring.
Not if you want me to keep makin' 'em for ya.
He was?
Sexogerarian, eh?  Yes.  Yes.  But I can't put that in the paper.
You know how they are... sex...
Is that what it means?
Nothing.
He's all right.  Isn't that enough?
You just want money -- and you haven't any right to any more.  He made a big settlement on you.
I won't have you hounding him any more for money.
Of course we do! We've been friends for years.
Yes.
Hello, Nick!  And a party - celebrating father's third murder - 
Going to run him through the fluoroscope?
Do you mind if I come down and see it?
I'm very interested in that body.
No.
She's ready to talk.  It won't do any harm, though - to find out where he is.
Do you know what they fought about that night he went away?
Well, thanks.  We'll call you when we need you again.
They'll be here.  Don't worry.  My men are picking them up.
So I see.
Never mind.
I trust you.
No.
You might do that.  Get me a ticket for...  No, you don't!
Oh he as clever about that.  He called when you were out.  That same afternoon, Julia telephoned to him. She said that you were coming, Mimi, to ask about Wynant. He got terrified. He was afraid that Julia would break down and tell... so he went to Julia and killed her and left Wynant's watch chain in her hand.
Last night.  He came to see me at my apartment.
He didn't say very much.  Wanted to know how I was and how the children were.
He's well-trained.  He'll behave himself.
Too bad you didn't bring your whip.
He'll be here.  Give him time to get his trousers on.  Where's Asta?  Asta!  Asta!
What's the matter with you?
Maybe I will.
I don't believe he did it.
No reason.  Just a hunch.  But I'm going to find out.  I'm tired of being pushed around.
Come on, Watson, we're going places.
I'm afraid you're lying, Mimi. You see, I really did see Wynant last night.
Two weeks work gone for nothing.
I don't care what you wanted to tell me.  You're through!  Get your things and get out!
There you go, Jaeger.  Just find the buried treasure, and you're a millionaire.
Him getting us stranded out here doesn't do much good either.
Probably was a couple of hundred years ago when whoever drew the map came through here.  Worn down to nothing now.
All right.  I'll go up, then you send up the gold and--
Doesn't matter.  Whatever he wanted he didn't get it.  We've got no need staying around here.  It's light enough.  Let's pack up and head out.
Sure, and I guess it was just convenient there was one less person to split the gold with.
Look, I know you guys are telling the truth.  It's just the Shi'ites don't know that.  I guess you could tell them...but then you don't speak the language do you?
Blow me.  Have I said that to you guys recently?  Blow me.
We disappear for awhile.  We disappear, we came back; nobody knows nothing.
Look at you, not even breaking a sweat. You're cool, boy.  You're cool.
Mine.
Don't let me die, Epps.  I don't want to die.
So good bye, Shi'ites.  Thanks for playing.  We have some lovely parting gifts for you as you go.
Is it dead?
Forget Wes.
Wes is dead!
Then he will be when those Iraqis get to him.  He was going to kill you.  He was one blink away from it.  He's dead, Epps, and I'm sure as hell not getting my head blow off over his carcass.
You sure you want me too?
And then what?
I...I never killed anyone before.  I told you that.
No, but I figure now's a real good time to start.
Hey, Jaeger.  What's up.
A map?  All I got is maps.  I'm gonna have Delayed Map Syndrome when I finally get out of here.  What kind of map you need?  Topographical, geographical, thermal?
Now you need me.
What?
I think I'm going to throw up.  I am. I'm going to toss.
Those people down there are Shi'ites. You've got Shi'ites in the south of Iraq and Khurds in the North.  Neither of them've got much love for Saddam. Probably figured once the war started there might be an uprising, so he sent his soldiers out to slap them around some.
He's a soldier.  He doesn't need a weapon.  He's got rocks.  He's got bare hands.
Permant cortex bond.
I didn't.  You asked me about the card.  You're going to get us into trouble.
I don't want to lose you.
What are you talking about? When did you sleep last?  Do you know what your trouble is? You're blind.  You've been here so long you can't see what is happening.  We must unite.  We need unity.  We need action. ) We have come to a time when we must....
Incredible!
What?
No!....
My mate has been acting very strange.  I can't explain it.....but.  I haven't been feeling very well myself.  I don't know, maybe it's me.  I needed an SP9 last night.  I feel as if something odd were happening to me. Something....
I can't understand.  The sedatives....
Off a girl's wrist. A suspect...
Hey, look--
Oh yeah? Prove it.
What?
Nothing.
We work fast enough for you?
Let's face it, we all knew it would happen sooner or later. The guy who can build a mousetrap that's better than we are ...
Nothing... just tired.
I'm sorry, detective, but you're just not my type.
No shit. I better send Meg flowers just in case.
What are you talking about, it's purring like a kitty.
She didn't work out, had to cut her loose.
She wanted to cook me breakfast.
IRA - instant retirement account.
I thought I told you--
Yes, M'sieu Laval?
No!
That's just what I tried to tell him. Well, one word led to another. He really was a very charming fellow. So we talked for about ten minutes.
Yes, Baron.
Yes, Baron.
Yes, Baron.  Moon in champagne.
Yes, Baron.
Yes, Baron?
No, Baron!  I beg your pardon.
No--no.
I would like to.
Why should you?
What?
But really, m'sieu, this isn't necessary.
Oh! You didn't read it!
Oh!
M'sieu Laval!
What's wrong now?
Too much blue in crimson.
No, no, no!  I disagree with you completely! I tried it once--
Peaches and cream.
Do you realize I have light eyes?
Talk? About me--about us?
Afraid I'm ruining your reputation, M'sieu Laval?
M'sieu Laval, I've got a confession to make to you ...
Goodbye.
Divine ...
But it could have been glorious.
Divine ... But that terrible policeman!
Oh, madame, you're just too sweet for words! 
What? You have to get to a boat right away!
Take the elevator to the very bottom, go left, down the crewman's passage, then make a right.
Hurry, Rose.
Don't you mean work me?
I'm not going to help you browbeat my hundred and one year old grandmother. I came down here to tell you to back off.
I put the diamond in my coat pocket. And I put my coat... on her.
Diamond. Yes it is. 56 carats.
Sure. Count me in.
I don't know what she's say, she don't know what I say, so we get along fine.
We've struck ice.
Excuse me.
Jack.
Well, here you are.
You're welcome. Rose.
That's not what I was thinking. What I was thinking was... what could have happened to hurt this girl so much she though she had no way out.
Uh huh. They'll be sorry. 'Course you'll be dead.
That penguin last night, is he one of them?
Is he your boyfriend?
Cal, surely you remember Mr. Dawson.
A diamond. A very rare diamond, called the Heart of the Ocean.
He couldn't have.
I promise.
I promise. I will never let go, Jack. I'll never let go.
Just tell us what you can --
Don't you hate people that surprise you? ... I do.  We can't stand here.
Yes, yes--the air--  --I'm getting plenty of air.  Miss Marsh--Mrs. Rosson.
Isn't that interesting?
And me coming in with two pair-- 
Oh--hello!  I got the flowers. That was sweet of you--thank you.
So you washed it off!
Good-by.
Good-by!
--sorry--got an appointment to play shuffle-board.
A lot of things I'd like to forget.
I can't blame the ocean--it's you.
What's the matter?
No, sir?
Change?
See you later, Shortie--I'm off to the pool.
I'll go with you--
Don't be too smart, Jimmy--you're out in the rough yourself. You had an argument with Lother a couple of hours before he was killed--but I'll deal with that later--
She did?
Very clear. That's one favor I'll be glad to do you.
What's that?
<U>Nuts</U> to you too!
It must be the sea air--it gets everybody.
It's all right--if you like honest faces--let's have another drink--Steward!
What do you mean?
Oh--I understand you were an important part of her education when she came to New York.
Meaning what?
Eh?... Oh.
There's a lot of trout in this stream just waitin' for a fly.  I've already been workin' on a young fellow from Chicago--related to one of the big packin' families--on his way to Biarritz for a good time. Likes a little game of bridge and poker.
I've lost my taste for knickknacks--
Have you ever figured they might extradite you?
"Smooth's" the word.
It all depends on what you're used to.
Isn't that a daisy?
Now Ed, are we cross?
I don't understand.
Crack me back of the head like Some stinkin' bull.  Hell, you Ain't no fightin' man, you're Just a cop.
Here it come: one-two-
Perfect, Wyatt.  Simply perfect.
Been hittin' it awful hard, Doc.
But Doc-
Sorry, sorry...
Sorry...
All right Wyatt, maybe you can. But you gotta die to do it. Understand?  You gotta die!
Wyatt Earp, I know.  I was Beginning to think we'd never Meet.  This is fortuitous.  That Means lucky.
I forgave you the moment you said it.
Honey, I gotta start makin' money.
Well I guess I don't have to go Right now.  I guess I could stay a little while.
No really, I can stay a while.
All right, well, good night.
All right, run 'em off.
Hey, Wyatt, God damn it, I'm serious!
Morgan, are you crazy?  They're Out gunning for us!  What the Hell're you doin'?
Morg, use your head.
I know, I was wrong.  But Morg, Look, we got to get out.
Doc's just in no kinda shape.
Wait a minute, you thinkin' of Getting in bed with the Cowboys?
You are the one, Wyatt.  You sure are.
- I'll be sure to acknowledge 007's 'assistance' in my report to the Prime Minister. But this is, still, a naval operation.
Oh, please, Mr. Bond. We live in the information age! Information is currency - and with the right currency, you can have any piece of information.  Besides I own the phone company. What do you say? Twenty minutes?
Sidney, perhaps we should leave this to -
Moneypenny! How indiscreet! Have you ever known me to kiss and tell?
Is this another one of your games?
I've got half the British government breathing down my neck. I don't have time for your nonsense.
Political considerations?
Tide and current charts. Work backward from the body - find where the ship sank.  Where did you get the boat?
Depends what number you write.
Think about mom.
Cleans dirt. Let's go.
Before we go any further here, Mr. Bond, from Lloyds of London, I just want to get two things straight.
First, that boat is in international waters. I'm claiming it for salvage. One-third of that gold is mine.
If you think we're going to have some kind of 'life affirming' romance here just because we cheated death, let me be clear:  We're going to have it where I want, and when I want.
Now.
Good luck on your mission, 007.
Good for you, Miss Winch. You now have exactly 30 seconds to get this rust bucket out of here.
Fifteen seconds. Perhaps you should consider hiring an attorney.
Hmmm. I suppose this is a step above that profession.  Ten seconds. Are you leaving?
You leave me no alternative.
Thank you, Uncle Elliot.
I should have hired this man.  Get somebody up there!
Maybe. Maybe not.
I told her I would if she would give me time.
You always got the best of it around here and when Dad always talks about my son, it is always you, so you fix the roof.
I told you about calling me boy. I ain't no boy. See, you and Dad got a bad habit of calling me boy. You call me boy in front of my wife. You think I'm going to fix the roof? I hope the wind blows the whole damn thing off and it pours down rain.
Like a veil has been lifted?
Like muddy waters?
You were in hell?
Do you think you won?
And what lesson have we learned from all of this, Babe Br... Sam... I mean Samuel?
You probably heard the wind stirring up those dead leaves over there.
No. Before anyone moves, you two shake hands and don't carry it any further.
Well if you're sure, I won't be a bother. Oh, I don't sleep on no spring mattress. I always make myself a pallet on the floor.
Where we come from, you had to know how to act right. You had to know how to say yes sir and no sir. You had to know your place.
Good afternoon to you.
That is a boy from home, Lulla's brother.
I remember Harry always trying to help someone. He got Lulla's daughter out of trouble. He was always running to the store for someone who couldn't leave the house.
Well, sure, we can leave it up.
Now go get Molly.  Your friends are going to be here any minute.
Where was the last place you left him?
Oh, I'm sure he's there.  You're just not looking hard enough.
Merry Christmas, Sheriff.
Are you saying you want to lodge a complaint with Star Command? WOODY Oh okay, so you want to do it the hard way, huh?
Go away.
I'll tell you what's -- AAAAH!
Years of Academy training...wasted!!
You did it!  Next stop.  Andy.
So, you see?  We're friends now, guys.  Aren't we, Buzz?  You bet.  Gimme a hug.
Patient is...  ...pre-e-epped.
Of course Woody ain't worried! He's been Andy's favorite since kindergarten!
Come on.  Let's get out of here.
Woody?  Who's up there with you?
Juvenile intrusion!  Repeat! Resume your positions NOW!
Right here, Woody!
But you're Irish!
I didn't know about the puppets. It's a lot to take in, all at once.
I finished it off.
We're too young.
Juliet who?
It's very hard for me to come and tell you this.
Arnie, I need money.  Somebody threatened my children.  They want a first payment of three million dollars.
Arnie, help me.  Doesn't anyone owe us money?
Please.  Tell me who Carl sells to.
Carl --
So's the video camera.
How?  Supportive letters from prison while I'm being kicked out of our home?  Do you have any idea what is happening out here?  Our credit cards are maxed. The people at the bank, you should see their faces when I walk in there. I have a letter from the government telling me that anything I sell from our house will be taken against an income tax lien.  Our friends are behaving like the crowd at a public hanging.  Nobody will help us.  Nobody will take us in.  Nobody wants anything to do with us.  So tell me, Carl, how you're gonna make it up to me.  Tell me again how we'll get through this, and maybe while you're at it you can put your hand up against the glass so we can have a tender moment of connection.
Tell me what to do, Carl.  I need guidance, not a fucking platitude.  I'm not bringing a child into the kind of life I grew up with.  I won't do it.  I want our life back.
What is this, like freebase?
Maradona is a cokehead.  Hand of God, my ass.  We're wasting our time here.
Winners don't do coke.  Or haven't you been reading the bumper stickers?
You're kidding.  Can't you shoot him or something?
When will you do it?
There's always a way.  If people get to the Pope or the President, you can get to him.
Yes, sir!
Yes, sir!
I don't know, sir.
She's nosy.  She hears me on the telephone.
Javier Rodriguez.
This is a business.  Get the fuck outta here.
What?  I thought Madrigal was dead. I thought it was verified.
I'll get there as soon as I can.
Shag her senseless.
You daft cunt. If you're going to waste it like that, you might as well leave it all to me. Now get the drinks in.
Did you bring the cards?
Are you clean?
Is that a promise, then?
Calm down, I'm just asking. Is that hash I can smell?
I wouldn't mind a bit, if it is.
Smells like it.
Too young for what?
Mr. Murphy, do you mean that you lied on your application?
You were referred here by the Department of Employment. There's no need for you to get you "foot in the door", as you put it.
Nineteen-sixty-seven.
One hundred and sixteen minutes.
Lewis Gilbert.
Eh - Ian Fleming?
OK, so who was it, then?
Well, this guy I've met runs a hotel. Brother. Loads of contacts. Does a nice little sideline in punting British passports to foreigners. Get you a good price.
It was just an idea.
It's really nice, Tommy. Can we go home now?
Look, Tommy, we know you're getting a hard time off Lizzy, but there's no need to take it out on us.
My pain?
Raise shields.
DO it. Go to Red Alert.
The power was within you.
Join my quest.
What you seek. What all men have sought since time began - ultimate knowledge. But to find it we'll need a starship.
Perhaps I have a way to bring one here.
Have faith, my friend. There are more of us than you know.
Captain, we're receiving transmission from Paradise City. They're demanding to know our intentions.
Paradise City, can you boost your power? We're barely receiving transmission.
Are we leaving, Captain?
Why?
I did not.
Technically, you are correct. I do not have a brother.
I have a half brother.
If I activate them now, Captain, we will be propelled upward at an unbelievable rate.
Sybok, listen to me. In order for this craft to enter the landing bay, Enterprise must lower the shields and activate the tractor beam. To get us inside and re-raise the shields will take-


It was not my intention to amuse you. These are serious charges. However, if you surrender now-
Yeah. Tryin' to find the file and erase it. Once that's gone, ain't nothin' can stop him. Just Eddie and his Master Control Program, runnin' things from on high..
For being on to Dillinger.
Right on the money!
I'm sorry, Walt. So much pressure lately... you feel like going for a drink?
Greetings, program...
Yeah, I... oops!
Lousy utility companies ... they're the same wherever you go.
Yeah, but I'm remembering all kinds of stuff. Like...my User wants me to go after the MCP
Boy, I bet I know who's workin' late tonight.
End of line.
As long as it gets us out of here
Where are you going?
Roger, One.  Rolling.
She knows not to steal.  I've taught her better than that.
Yeah, right.
Hardcore, highly fanatical, ultra-    * fundamentalist.  Linked to     * numerous car-bombings, that cafe    * bomb in Rome, and the 727 out of Lisbon last year.  Major player.    *
You didn't have sexual relations with him?
If I break it they can take it out of my pay.
That's right.  They want something...  dramatic.  I spoke to a number of people who said you're the one to see.
Me too.
It sounds wild.  So now you're a big hero, right?  For fixing their system.
My husband the hero.
What did you need?
I don't know what this crazy bitch is on.  You should just cut her loose, so we can get down to business.
Dance?
No.  Soon as I turn you'll shoot me.
The same place.  One o'clock.  I have to go now.  See you tomorrow.  Remember, I need you.
It's just that... it's been sixteen years since anyone but Harry did that, I--
He wants to speak with you.
Don't eat anything.
I took a cab.
Sure. Why not?
What time is it?
I suppose you gotta get up early, huh?
Well, it's just when I see a really good movie I really like to go out and get some pie, and talk about it. It's sort of tradition. Do you like to eat pie after you've seen a good movie?
Would you like to get some pie?
I finally knew what I wanted when I grew up.
Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes...
It is what I want. But I don't want to spend the next ten years in jail. I don't want you guys to go to jail. We don't know what could be waiting for us up there. It'll probably be just what it's supposed to be. The only thing that's waiting for us is two hundred thousand dollars. I'm just looking at the downside.
Can you live with it?
With that son-of-a-bitch walkin' around breathin' the same air as you? And gettin' away with it every day. Are you haunted?
You wanna get unhaunted?
Then shoot 'em. Shoot 'em in the face. And feed that boy to the dogs.
I ain't tellin' ya nothin'. I'm just sayin' what I'd do.
He don't got no right to live.
I don't blame you.
Killin' 'em's the hard part. Gettin' away with it's the easy part. Whaddaya think the cops do when a pimp's killed? Burn the midnight oil tryin' to find who done it? They couldn't give a flyin' fuck if all the pimps in the whole wide world took two in the back of the fuckin' head. If you don't get caught at the scene with the smokin' gun in your hand, you got away with it.
Has he gotten his mail today?
Let me handle this.
Really?
I don't blame you.  So we'd both fuck Elvis. It's nice to meet people with common interests, isn't it?
I guess so. Follow me.
Lee, Clarence . Please don't insult me. Call me Lee.
Thank you very much, Clarence.
I hear you talkin' Clarence. We park our cars in the same garage.
You're always making jokes. That's what you do, isn't it? Make jokes. Making jokes is the one thing you're good at, isn't it? But if you make a joke about this -  - I'm gonna go completely out of my fuckin' head!
Step inside.
To front for him. So Elliot is workin' out the deal between them and his boss, a big movie producer named Lee Donowitz.
Naw. It don't feel too good but it's alright.
You must be high. Uh-huh. No way.
I'm not gonna put that shit in my purse.
No way, Jos.
I'm not wearing a bra.
No.
Read my lips.
I DON'T WANT YOUR "WOMEN," YOU BRAINLESS TWIT! I WANT TO BE WELL!
What are you going to do with us?
No more drugs.  Please...
I'm not going to "do" anything, I promise.  But you need help, James. None of this is what you think it is.
No.  I want you to turn yourself in, James -- It'll go much better for you if you do -- but I'm not going to trick you.
I...I...We need cash, James.
No!  Look, I don't belong here!  What I need to do is make a telephone call to straighten everything out.
Scientists.  I'm supposed to report in to them.  They'll want to know they sent me to the wrong time.
No, no.  I can't talk to them.  It's called, "voice mail".  I'm supposed to leave messages. They monitor it from the present.
Listen to me -- I can't do anything about what you're going to do. I can't change anything.  I can't stop you.  I just want some information...
I just need to have access to the pure virus, that's all!  For the future!
I didn't think I was being defensive. I was just...
Okay, it was bad judgment.  But I have the strangest feeling about him -- I've seen him somewhere and...
I said it was bad judgment!  What else do you want me to say?
Might be tight.
On your normal mornin', okay, plenty a time, but today, gotta take inta account your Army-of-the-Twelve-Monkeys factor.
Twelve Monkeys, honey.  Guess you folks didn't turn on your radio this morning.
Well, a man with some gumption.  How much money you got?
You want to make a kiddies bet?
I'll give you the money!  Okay? I'll give you two-fifty.  Just . . . just, please.
I don't have a credit card.  They took my wallet.
You son of a bitch!
'Cept that she lost her money and the sons of bitches stole her wedding ring.  That's when she started shooting.  Can't blame her. The ring was all Carlos left her when he died.
Sheriff Potter.
My name is John.  Now I'm not a stranger anymore.  See how easy it is for us to get to know each other, beautiful?
I don't know your real name.
Maybe, but if you didn't I think you would have kept on walking.
My cup runneth over, beauti--
May I carry your package, Grace?
I guess it must.
A little of this, a little of that. Mostly I tell fortunes.
From my father.  He was the tribe's Shaman.
Those are white words, not ours.
Come here.
You could just leave him.
You just walk away.
You need a meal ticket is what you mean.  Some guy you can latch onto just long enough for him to get you out of here.
Whatever it takes.
I told you.  I knew it was there. Didn't I tell you?
You killed him!
Thirty-thousand, that's all.  We would have been free and clear.  You didn't have to kill him.
Walk to where?  We're fifty miles to the nearest town.  It's going to be over one-hundred degrees today.  How far do you think you're going to get?
Yeah, they'll find you.  Dried up and twice dead.
At least I'll have company when I die.  Ain't that right, Jake?
What do you say, Jake?  Should we trust her?  No?  I didn't think so.
Just ran into a little trouble.
No.
No.
I had a problem getting my car back.
No.
She's dead.
I've had time to get over it.
Oz.
You're too quick for me.
Yeah, I know.  You're TNT.  Just like dynamite.  When you go off somebody gets hurt.  All right.  Let's do this.
No, sir.  And I'm not going to be around long if that's what you're worried about.
Not as bad as it looks.
Wouldn't know anything about it.
Wish I could help, Sheriff.  But if you'll excuse me I'm going over to Harlin's to pick up my car.  Then I'm getting the hell out of this place.
Maybe not for you, Sheriff, but I think I've had my fill of your little town.
But, Senor--
Senor, you need a doctor.
Difference between you and me, old man, is I see the glass half full, you see it half empty.
You afraid of the dark?
So, we're all just floating along like twigs in a stream, so enjoy the ride.  Is that it?
Not this twig, friend.  I got plans.
No and I don't plan on sticking around either.
You got a lotta philosophy in you, old timer but you don't fool me for one second with all this blind man crap. One minute you lost your eyes in Vietnam, next it's the joint. Now it's a woman? I'm hep to you.
Give it to me!
I'm leaving.  You never have to see me again.  Just please, give me the ticket!
Would I what?
No!
Cause she's dead.
I've had time to get over it.
Oz.
You're too quick for me.
Jesus.  Twenty-after-ten and it must be ninety already.
Well, that key's not gonna work. I had to pop the lock. You didn't leave me the trunk key.
When I work on a car, I work on a car.
What happened to your hand?
You should be more careful.
Like you.
Grace, I've been fucked over too many times, by too many women.  You're becoming the queen of hot and cold.
Try me.
Nothing I understand better than a mess.
I don't think we have anything to talk about.
There is no us, remember?
Stop it.
Because I know you're full of shit.
I thought you couldn't get your car.
Is that what changed your mind?  The money?
<u>I don't know why</u>!
And love's a funny thing.  Sometimes I don't know if I want to love you...
How much?
One way.
Hell, no. That Wayne can't shoot when he's sober, much less drunk. He's lucky he didn't kill his own danged self.  Well, anyhow, you stay cool. Nice meeting you, son.
Shhhh! Just like your Mama, always scared of things...
Is Noel in?
Oh.
Wow.
That's strange isn't it? Not remembering one fever... Or a cold... Or a sore throat. What do you think that means?
Jesus.
In college. A car accident.
How did you know that man you bumped was carrying a weapon?
You thought he was carrying a knife?
It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm David Dunne.
We are.
I mean if you knew karate?
What if he wasn't aloud to kick and you were really mad at him?
Jeremy if you pull that trigger I'm going to leave! I'm going to go to New York.
How did you get together?
On account of they seen you was beatin' on their friend.
Asked what they looked like, that's all. Christ, maybe he's tough but he sure ain't no carpenter.
Alice an' Silky gave them... free ones.
You want... a free one.
Alive?
He admit it?
Those cowboys messin' him up?
You an' Andy get the hell out there. Find out where them other two went.
"Deserve" don't mean shit, Little Bill.
Give it to him.
I could of... easy.
Like I was sayin' you don't look like no meaner than hell cold-blooded damn killer.
Well, Uncle Pete said you was the goddamndest meanest sonofabitch ever lived an' if I ever wanted a partner for a killin', you was the worst one. Meanin' the best. On account of you're cold as snow an' don't have no weak nerve nor fear.
What business?
Well... I don't recollect.
Shut up, Kid.
Well, I gu-guess they had it... comin'.
Two weeks, I guess.
How far kin you see?
Shit, Ned, this ain't the time to quit.
Nothin's bent.
You gonna share your half with him?
Maybe.
We'll bury him.
You mean, am I gonna help you kill them cowboys?
An' if I spot 'em?
Just like that?
Yeah?
I'm having a stroke.
This whole thing was a shakedown.
The word I got is you hung up your spurs, man. What's that all  about?
Verb - Roger, this is Edie Finneran. Edie, this is Roger Kint, he was at
McManus wants to go in shooting. I said no way.
They're pretty pissed off. They'll do anything. Now I got a way to do it without killing anyone: but like I said, they won't let me in without you.
Maybe more.
Not if we do it my way.
Who's your boss?
Don't jerk me off. We all know what this is. You don't work with me if I work with you without knowing who I'm working for. Now let's cut the shit. Who's the man?
Ain't it a crime? Call if you're interested.
I don't think he does. Not exactly, but there's a lot more to his story. I want to know why twenty-seven men died on that pier for what looks to be ninety-one million dollars worth of dope that wasn't there. Above all, I want to be sure that Dean Keaton is dead.
Come on. Keaton was a cop for four years. Who else would know the Taxi Service
Give a guy a break, huh?
Keaton was Keyser Soze
She's the only nurse who isn't testifying for the Doctors.
Nothing.
Very good.
As far as we know, nothing.
Don't equivocate.  Be positive. Just tell the truth.
Objection.
... that's all right.
It was good of you to meet...
Right.  Who called?
... and you're going to do that?
You're going to settle out of court?
This is a complicated case, your Honor...
My client can't walk, your Honor.
Mr. Concannon...?
I've got to work.
You're going to stay here...?
What do you want?
Don't touch anything.
D'you find the obstetric nurse?
Gimme the address.  I'm gonna go. We're going to need her.
Come on, we'll get a cup of coffee...
You live in the neighborhood?
How old is he?
How'm I doing so far?
No, it sounds idiotic, I know. And you're still the hard-headed Scot, aren't you? Always were. Do you think I'm making it up?
I'm not making it up. I wouldn't know how. She'll be talking to me about something, nothing at all, and suddenly the words fade into silence and a cloud comes into her eyes and they go blank... and she is somewhere else, away from me... someone I don't know. I call to her and she doesn't hear. And then with a long sigh she is back, and looks at me brightly, and doesn't know she's been away... can't tell me where... or why...
More and more in the past few weeks. And she wanders. God knows where she wanders. I followed her one day.
Listen, I'm going to yell in a minute!
I suppose I could phone the store in the morning, and say I'm sick.
I know. Because I remind you of her. The one that's dead. And not even that, very much.
How does it work?
Oh, yeah. There.
Yes!
Your accident...
I don't know... Switzerland?
No.
What?
We have.
Here with you.
The tall trees...
Yes...
I'm here, I've got you...
I love you too... too late... too late...
Too late... there's something I must do...
I thought you said no more aches and pains?
No three-way stretch? How very un- chic.
What's tomorrow?
Oh, damn it! Damn it, damn it --
All I said in the note was: "Where are you?" That doesn't sound desperate to me.
I just thought if I gave you a drink and fed you some dinner, you'd be so grateful you'd take me to a movie.
Oh... this and that.
If you want to. Naturally, we won't talk about anything you don't want to talk about.
Excellent.
Franco mother-fucking Harris!
Don't you fucking threaten me - I'll fucking kill you.
You go home!
We have a dead woman bleeding all over the bathroom. What options? Call the police.
That is not an "option." There is no multiple choice here.
I am not flexible on this.
What?
Later.
What.
I don't think so.
I'm with Tina. Is she there?
Jack Kerouback, Herman Melville, Henry Miller and Hunter S. Thompson. I dedicate this evening to fear and to major loathing. So from sun set to sun rise, let me be heard...
Who's up for making some real money?
I think we should say some words over the grave.
I'm talking about prayer.
Suck my ass.
Oh really? Starbucks?
Goosed!
What are you talking about?
I asked you to marry me. I'm ready for marriage. That's responsibility. That's growth.
Who else?
You don't like Moore? Since when?
What does Moore have to do with your growing?
I've known him since Cub Scouts.
He's quiet.
I'm working on it.
What money?
I'm sorry...I'm sorry...I'm sorry...
What?
I kind of like "till death do us part." I mean, this is forever. In sickness and in health, through good times and bad. Honey, what do you think?
I KILLED MY BROTHER!
Tell me the answer to this! What bird lays eggs in a barn?
You are spoiling me too much. I won't know what to do with myself when you've gone.
No, Uncle, and now I'm pleased to have been able to do this favor, because, although I didn't think so at first, you are really a good man.
Yes, sir. Good night.
I didn't want to do it, Don Jorge. They made me ...
Nothing.
It's Viridiana. She's getting on my nerves.
If you free me, you'll be a rich man ...
I've been expecting you; I got a letter from the lawyer.
She's left.
No.
I'm afraid.
A black bull came.
He has paid for your studies and your maintenance, and he has just sent your dowry. Does that mean so little to you, Viridiana?
I'm only good at making people laugh.
No, I don't want to.
But only you will know he's not human.
She wasn't part of the deal, Cox.
We have an emergency situation which requires somebody with expertise in criminal psychology. Under the authority vested in me by the President, I'm giving you temporary reassignment.
You're going to put your theories to practice. I'm sending you into the field.
The reason you insisted on testing my system with prisoners is because of the increased risks involved with increased realism.
I'm still making adjustments...
I'M WHAT?!
I understand... I understand perfectly.
Did you recognize the son-of-a bitch who got away?
Think hard -- it'll come to you...
What you need is a collar.
I've been in prison, remember?
Just like they figured there was no better person to catch one...
Stop me.
No! Grimes isn't back. He's only one part of Sid. Sid 6.7 is a hell of a lot worse than Grimes ever was.  Get a hold of yourself!
...I think so...You?
Lindenmeyer?
Sid?
Let me put it to you this way... whether I'm here...or whether I'm not...I'm leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night.
You're with him tonight, watching the President's Speech, when the President...
<u>Lure</u> him. 
Well, darlin' <u>I</u> ain't your confessor.  Tell him you've got some info on the President's sex scandal, it's on your conscience, believe me, he'll drop what he's doing.  Okay;  <u>Now</u>:  Folks, folks, folks, this is a shitty business, and it needs no Ghost Come From the Grave to tell us that.  But in Six Days, Lord willing n'Jesus Tarries, I am going to take you beauties into the second term. .....wait til you hear the speech tonight.  The 3-0-3 Speech... where's the Fad King, by the way...
When you...  What?  I'm busy.
<u>Hello</u>.  What?
...can we have a white one...?
Come on.
Come on.
They caught him in the closet with a Girlscout.  Side- effects of a pill ain't gone trump that.  You have to keep'em guessing for  Two weeks.  You  don't have to Cure Cancer, Pal, you just have to give them something more interesting than...
Why?
...<u>nothing</u>...
What did Albania ever do to us?
...you want us to go to War with Albania.
Waal, I gotta tell you.  I've been inside the Beltway fourteen years, and I feel like I Just Got My Feet Wet.
It's the Pride of a Job Well Done, Stanley, yes, but it's <u>more</u> than that.
Guess who <u>I</u> am.
I know who you are, Mr. Ames.
Quite touching.
Guess what?  We show, and N.S.A. confirms, there <u>are</u> no nuclear devices on the Canadian border.  There are no nuclear devices in Albania.  Z'at put us in something of a pickle?  Albania <u>has</u> no nuclear capacity.  Our spy satellites show "no secret terrorist camps" in The Albanian Hinterland.  The F.B.I. and the Border Patrol, And the R.C.M.P. report no repeat no untoward activity along our picturesque Canadian Border.  The Albanian Government is screaming its innocence, the world is listening.  There is no War.
...we will <u>not</u> be swayed, will, will not be <u>swayed</u> from <u>Every</u> effort to find <u>our</u> Old Shoe, our...
Yeah, I need a list, people in Military Special Pro...
Well, that's what we're <u>doing</u> here...
How you going to stretch it?  This won't hold for eleven days.  Guy fucked a twelve- year-old...whadday're gonna do to hold that off?
Uh, <u>nothing</u>, oh, <u>nothing</u> ... uh... a <u>War</u>, uh...  You're kidding.
I'm gonna <u>tell</u> you why...
Uh, it's a slogan.  From, uh...
That's from the ... it's got to be from the...
...uh ... No, that's...
...we put your Guy in a <u>sweater</u>...
"Good Old Shoe -- "  We put him in a sweater.
...we'll gettim in their cars.
Big mistake.
Guy says he'll respect her tomorrow, he <u>might</u>, but why take a chance?  Hold out til after you're married. That's... that's.... looky, we're offering'em Schumann, make em <u>vote</u> for hhhh.... psychologically, they will understand that that's the bargain.  Make them pay for him.  Make... that's right, the price is their vote. Now, we bring him home, the President announces he is flying <u>home</u>, he's <u>here</u>, he's <u>there</u>... f'there the election, TA DA, here he is.  Have him say it like I wrote it, It'll be fine. Thanks.  Labor, five bucks an hour.  If you <u>watch</u>, <u>ten</u> bucks an hour.  If you <u>help</u> ... if you <u>help</u>, a <u>hundred</u> bucks an hour.
Ain't <u>that</u> the truth. 
What am <u>I</u> gonna do?  I'm gonna "Fade Away."  What are you gonna do?
Cause I don't think <u>this</u> dog is gonna hunt....
Yeah, well, perhaps...  Speaking of which:  I have a <u>prescription</u> here, I'm going to give you the <u>number</u>, I need you standing by with a <u>crate</u> of the stuff.... it's ... what is it?
It's an anti-psychotic, the num...  the number...hello...hello...
"...unsure whether or not Enemy Action..."
...but...
...what is this?
The special hats of the Special Anti-terrorist detachment of the Border Patrol.
Yeah, good good good good good.  And They're <u>So</u> <u>Secret</u>...
Cause the beans, y'know, y'can tell if they're <u>puttin</u> stuff in it.
They don't know what's going on!
Great Charlie, any better it'd be a sin.
Cindy. Having sex with her is like reading the Wall Street Journal 'cept the Journal don't talk back. 'Sides this AIDS crap is ruining romance, nobody trusts anybody anymore, gotta get a blood test in the toilet before you leave a bar together, somebody oughtta invent an AIDS dipstick, no kidding, make a fortune. I gotta get to work... Z's today. 
Not in here Dad... please. Later.
Your responsibility, Dad, is to present the facts, not your opinions, to the men... you're gonna destroy their lives, Dad! Don't do it to 'em. Give it a chance. Let the membership decide for themselves, Dad. Please.
Your men! All my life "your men" have been able to count on you? Why is it that you've never been there for me?
Wherever you like, Lutece, 21, the River Cafe...or maybe we can just drive around for a while.  Work up an appetite.
It's a dog, what else you got, sport, besides connections at the airport?
'Course. Larry Wildman. One of the first raiders.
I remember that deal. You were involved?
How much?
Dump it.
I'll bet he's got an opinion on the stock market too. This apartment is already ahead of its time. I call it the "demolished" look. They've already heard about it at House and Garden and they're coming next week to photograph it before it gets... lived in. Is that alright? I'd love to have it in my portfolio.
Get the hell out!
Harold, you don't mind strolling around the block a couple hundred times, do you?
I could break you, mate, in two pieces over my knees, you know it, I know it, I could buy you six times ever, I could dump the stock just to burn your ass but I happen to want the company and I want your block of shares. I'm announcing a tender offer at 65 tomorrow, and I'm expecting your commitment.
It's eleven forty-five let's go
Too late for that sir.  Give my love to the misses.  Get those bastards!
Who's is all this?
Well divide 18 into three
Mom, I'm sorry.  I wanted to tell you. But it never felt right.
Mm-hmm.
I am.
I'm not...
What?
Um...sure.
Biology.  She wanted to be a doctor.
What?
I don't...
Jody, she's alive.
Mrs. Feur.  She's alive.  I met her. She's really sweet.
Nothing.  It wasn't anything.  I've been on edge lately.  Maybe since the accident. And I'd prefer, I really would, to just--
Did I?
Hartford?
No.  Jody, listen to me.  You have to listen to me.  This is not something that I can do right now.  Whatever it was, it's gone.  I need it to be gone now.
Please.
Did he say that?
What if he was?  Do you think he wanted to bring that up again just when you're trying to make a new start?
He's trying to put it behind him, Claire. You should too.
Nice.  Almost done.
Of him I think.
More or less.
In the house.  I was scared.
No.  Can you drive me home?  I'll bring you back in the morning.
No.  Look!  In the window.
No!  And I don't need a psychiatrist!
Good.  You sat in front...I saw you there...
What?
Incredible.  We should take a drive before they're gone.  Spend the night at some cozy little bed and breakfast.
Yep.  There's some great places nearby.
What?
Huh.
Don't think so.
Lasher is my legacy - not Michael's.   Aaron, I've seen the pain in Michael.  I can't bear to see anymore.   He's not to know.  Swear to me.
There is a difference between sensing danger - and being afraid.  what defines you in the landscape, Michael...?  what anchors your life...? Your work...?  Your creativity...?
Then focus on how you feel about her. Because your feelings define you.   Take off your gloves, Michael.
Mm-hmm.    Seems & lot longer.
I want to see my mother.  Where is she...?
I'm NOT like you!  I'm NOT! You're cruel -
Nooo...  NO!  Stop!
I only wanted to see as others do... feel as others do...  ...but Marguerite could not help me.  Nor Julien...
No, my love.  I want nothing more of the dead.  I want you to --- chang me.
No!   Don't!  Lasher!!!
The one time I want it to work...
You're not gonna give me the textbook analysia, are you doctor...? My vision was just the chemical reaction of an oxygen-starved brain - and nobody -
It's come to that, huh...?  Three weeks - and you need a psychic skin flick to perk up our sex life...?
What about you coming down here...?
They need doctors in New Orleans too.   Michael - think what I could do with the money!
Their what...?
Your beneficence.
That's not good enough.  Why not...?!
Left behind...?  This about Rowan...?
I'm sorry - I didn't think
Oh really - you must remember me from when I was a regular customer.
I'm terribly sorry - I have a bad memory...
I'm a dentist
Tell me about your adopted MOTHER
Out - I may be some time
You killed my friend!
I'm here about the so called disappearance of your husband - It's best if we let old bones lie. Know what I mean?  I'm working on the WHITE ANGEL case now - and I've got to check all known murderers or suspected murderers for the last five years... And that means you...So where were you last THURSDAY afternoon around five...
Yes - of course.
You have a better chance of being hit by a Mack truck with a refrigerated cargo bed full of sirloin tip.
Be cool. Fake it if you have to.
Take a whiff of heaven.
I'd call you a sick, twisted fuck. But this is different.  She wasn't your mother mother--
Oh, god.  Look. Look.
I do? I mean, yeah, I do.
Do it?
But that doesn't make you the boss of everything, son.
It's okay. You need me?
What do you mean? I'm Ted Nelson.
We'll send you the release forms, Ted. Our staffers will help in any way they can.
You want it in writing?
Your article sucked.
In the sense that there is no "hidden agenda" behind a bake sale that raised five hundred dollars for seeing eye dogs.
Come on, Julie. Don't screw up. You have some real talent.
I'm trying to help.
That's not ENTIRELY true.
He didn't. He had it built.
Not "whatever."  It's two different things.
He phoned it in.
I doubt it.
The ozone must be fully depleted on Planet Ted.
Your dad taught you everything.
A father is nothing but sperm, Ted. It takes a real man to be a dad.
It's incredibly simple.
Eventually you'll let go.
Then you'll see who's really holding on to you.
I know.
But you never do.
I'm not going anywhere, Ted. You're the one with the champagne wishes and caviar dreams.
Only the best for my mother.
I'll make you very proud.
Mr. Nelson, you disappoint me. First you break our school board rules. Then you break the law.
Our state has a zero tolerance policy for underage drinking.
Alcohol does horrible things to a developing young mind.
Me? The King of Coitus?
Whoa. But...that's the thing...  I've never even actually...
--PEACHES! CANNED PEACHES!
That's great.  I'll just tell my creditors I'm not a rapist.  No problem... Shit.  I can't believe the board's going to act without even hearing my side of it.
She still work there?
Was there ever any kind of investigation...
Suzie Toller is missing.
The skinny brunette.
You mean Camp Sixty-Nine.
I mean something bad, Gloria, something bad you saw coning, and you didn't do anything, and then it happened.  I did that once.  I don't want to do it again.
Yeah, maybe, a little.
You heard Kelly say "Sam."  That was Lombardo on the phone.  And you saw the girls...
I don't believe I'm hearing this.  A month ago you were pulling these two apart at the courthouse.  They were acting.  They were all acting, from the beginning.  And we bought it, hook, line and sinker... And now they're home free with six million of Sandra Van Ryan's money.
I said he did.
I'm scared, that's what.  I'm scared there's no one to trust.
I'm not on your property!
I won't.
Do it to ourselves?
Stick?
You can tie whoever did it to Sandra Van Ryan...
Lady has some deep pockets.  That's all I'm saying.
Will they?
Then he'll be back at Blue Balls?
That's right.
Shut up.  Don't fall apart.  The only people who can blow this is us. Remember?
I'll bet.  Look, Sam.  Why don't you come by this weekend.  We'll take the boat out...
What?  Running over alligators with that silly swamp jalopy when you could be sailing a real boat...
You need that real often?
No offense, but all I ever need...  Are these...  And this.
All right, if it'll make you happy, I'll try that.
Come on, Jim.  I'm serious.  Dot...  Dash.  It'll be our secret means of communication should we ever need it.
Those kids, they took my wagon. Never got it back.
I was six.  And ever since, my policy is: Act first and worry later.
It's not a guy...
Well, hell, maybe we do have a chance.
My Lord, he was telling the truth!
Well, I owe you one, don't I?
My friend?
On my way to Denver...
Has it penetrated that adrenaline- addled skull that you are surrounded by seventy-eight of my loyal followers?  You are in my domain!
It's a smelting retort.
They're not after me.  They want the baby.
My prsence cannot extend beyond this forest.  But I can give you these...
My step-father's going to tear you apart.
As above, so below.
You hear trouble.
Because she's sick.
Willow!
Daikinis are giant people who live far far away.
Patience.  Concentrate.  You will find a way.
Use the philosopher's stone!  Hur- ry!  Invocation!  Release them!
Yes!  Raziel!  She lives out on that island!
Hurry!  Queen Cherlindrea will know what to do.
Sorry. It's important.
Who'd you see?
I hope you don't have any doubts about that.
Who else knows?
Okay, what are you going to need to clean it up
Maybe the Bureau. Or those bastards at Treasury. I'll take care of it.  I hate this shit, Johnny. You cut their balls off for me. I'm counting on you.
Yes. And I also want to leave this city.
We do not go into your courts.
No, no doctor...
Gunshot... they'll file reports... they'll find me.
Oh. The bullets.
Let's just find Coalmine.  Listen, Zenovich made a mistake. You didn't let anybody down. It happens 
He accused John of taking kickbacks. And you know  anybody who knows John  knows that's a goddamn lie!
Better you should get off my front porch before I get my mace!
I don't know where he is.
I have done nothing against the ordnung.
I have committed no sin.
That is idle talk.
My son is out there!
No, Aunt Em -- this was a real, truly live place.  And I remember that some of it wasn't very nice....
Yes, sir.  So we'd like you to keep your promise to us, if you please, sir.
All in good time, my little pretty -- all in good time.
Certainly -- certainly -- when you give me those slippers.
Very well! Throw that basket in the river and drown him!
Toto, too.
Whenever you wish.
Uh-huh.
My mouth -- my mouth!
Oh --
Look -- it ticks!
Hah!
Are you gonna stand around And let 'em fill us full of horror?
Ohhhh --
And I'll keep the oil-can handy.
Looks like we came a long way for nothing.
It did?
Oh - I was only trying to help. Ohhh!
Wait a minute. This is the left one. He walks bad enough already.
Ohhhh -- yes...yes, sir -- Y-Yes, your Honor.  You see, a while back, we were walking down the Yellow Brick Road, and --
Ohhhhhh!
Look -- you can see it here.  It's wonderful!
Oh!  Well, what happened to you?
Well, that's you all over.
Well, I --
Well, I --
Well, I --
So who are you?
Hes going to insert the plutonium.
Since Oxford. I knew him when he had nothing but a brilliant mind and enough guts to conquer the world. Hes a man of great integrity.
Then Robert was right about a Russian connection.
The inside man?
Perhaps Sir Robert had a word with the Man Upstairs.
You knew him well?
Its the only way out...
Shush.
He killed me! He killed me the day he refused to pay my ransom.
Whats your business with Elektra King?
She dropped a million and half dollars to the House -- your House. And you didnt even bat an eyelid.  She was paying you off.  What for?
Former KGB surveillance post. The Dye Factory was just a front; now it turns a good profit.
No.  It is the beginning. The world will never be the same.
What about the aftermath?  This so-called . . . "nuclear winter" theory?
The weather.  I see.  Keep me posted.  I want hourly forecasts and a full report on optimum strike conditions.
Oh?  The CTU suspects a Libyan hit squad.
Life and death are unquantifiable abstracts.  They don't concern me.
Yes, I loved you.  I left the earth when I lost you.
I didn't give you cancer, Laurie.  Not you, not the others.  I don't know what did.
Memories of the future are just like any others.  I've tried not to dwell on the unpleasant ones . . .  You won't die of cancer, Laurie.  There won't be time for that.
You know how he is.  He goes on these binges, kills a couple of thugs -- then he's satisfied.  It blows over.
If he comes here, I'll handle him.  Remember -- I've always protected you.  Haven't I?  Do you need money?
You did the right thing, Daniel.  Let's stay in touch, okay?  Good night.
Damn straight!  We were heroes.
Well, that was Adrian's idea.  I know he's the smartest man in the world and all that, but -- talk about publicity hounds . . .
Oh yeah.  The one that used to confess to everything?  Hoping we'd beat him up?
He pulled it on Rorschach . . . and Rorschach dropped him down an elevator shaft.
One more down.  Someone tried to kill Adrian.  . . . First time I've ever heard him scared.
I don't want to take 'em out.  Just want to keep 'em interested.
That Detroit shit?  I'm so worried.
Wherever we are, it's better than what we left.  Backs together --
Veidt's assassin.  Leads to follow.  Can't just --
Coward.  Giving up.
Did you know he was back on the streets?
Isn't it true that you --
Edgar William Jacobi, aka William Edgar Bright, a.k.a. Moloch.
That shows me already that you don't have a clue. What's it to you, anyway?
Good for you. Now why don't you stop wasting my time and tell me what you want. You didn't go through all this for my benefit.
A Fed, I shoulda known. Who else would have this kind of budget? Now you're gonna hit me with the sales pitch.
..If you're trolling around for narcs, man, have you got the wrong guy.
Look at me, dude, do I look like a fan of law enforcement? Forget the tests, you shoulda just asked me. I woulda saved you a lot of trouble.
Are we done now? You've got nothing on me. So if you ain't booking me, I'm walking.
Is that a fact?
You know what I hate? Any scumbag with a clean shirt and a bad haircut can get one of those tin stars and suddenly they think they're God.
Yeah, I sent you pictures. Here's what I'm thinking. If they take out the cameras and sensors, they could probably put a bomb in this thing. You drop it in the water in the Red Sea and three weeks later it's swimming up the Potomac.
Hey, one miracle at a time. They're on to me now, remember?
Oh, I don't know. It was an accident.
Yorgi asked me to.
Go to hell.
Mind your business.
They'll kill you, you know they will. Besides, there is no back door. Keep smiling. Ready? Now.
He owns a big industrial complex on the river. He'll launch it from there.
I'd forgotten how exciting it is working together.
Why don't we go below decks and work off some of this adrenaline.
Alright, so I'll get more.
Well if you're bailing, I guess I'd better give you your surprise now.
A parachute. This does not argue well.
I'm somewhat less so. We seem to have a bit of a problem...
Don't forget goatee boy. I greased him up on the diamond run.
I don't like him being here.
You saw what happened tonight.  You think Magneto won't come after him again.  You think he won't come here if necessary.  This is a school, for God's sake.
You know, you --
Math.  History.  Science.  English. Athletics --
Control, Senator...  we teach them control.
