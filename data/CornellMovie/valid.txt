1 Can we make this quick?  Roxanne Korrine and Andrew Barrett are having an incredibly horrendous public break- up on the quad.  Again.	Well, I thought we'd start with pronunciation, if that's okay with you.
2 Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part.  Please.	Okay... then how 'bout we try out some French cuisine.  Saturday?  Night?

1 How do you get your hair to look like that?	Eber's Deep Conditioner every two days. And I never, ever use a blowdryer without the diffuser attachment.

1 I figured you'd get to the good stuff eventually.	What good stuff?
2 The "real you".	Like my fear of wearing pastels?

1 I have to be home in twenty minutes.	I don't have to be home 'til two.

1 Oh my God, does this mean you're becoming normal?	It means that Gigglepuss is playing at Club Skunk and we're going.
2 Oh, I thought you might have a date  I don't know why I'm bothering to ask, but are you going to Bogey Lowenstein's party Saturday night?	What do you think?
3 I think you're a freak.  I think you do this to torture me.  And I think you suck.

1 But	After that, I swore I'd never do anything just because "everyone else" was doing it.  And I haven't since. Except for Bogey's party, and my stunning gastro-intestinal display --
2 Why didn't you tell me?	I wanted to let you make up your own mind about him.
3 No. you didn't!  If you really thought I could make my own decisions, you would've let me go out with him instead of helping Daddy hold me hostage.

1 Oh, God.  It's starting.	It's just a party. Daddy.

1 Why do girls like that always like guys like that?	Because they're bred to.  Their mothers liked guys like that, and their grandmothers before them. Their gene pool is rarely diluted.
2 He always have that shit-eating grin?	Joey Dorsey?  Perma-shit-grin.  I wish I could say he's a moron, but he's number twelve in the class.  And a model.  Mostly regional stuff, but he's rumored to have a big tube sock ad coming out.

1 He's pretty!	Okay!  I wasn't sure

1 What 're you talking about?	She's partial to Joey, not me

1 Yeah	What do you think?

1 Hey.	Are you lost?
2 Nope - just came by to chat	We don't chat.
3 Well, actually, I thought I'd run an idea by you.  You know, just to see if you're interested.	We're not.

1 I appreciate your efforts toward a speedy death, but I'm consuming.  Do you mind?	Does it matter?
2 If I was Bianca, it would be, "Any school you want, precious.  Don't forget your tiara."

1 Are you following me?	I was in the laundromat. I saw your car. Thought I'd say hi.
2 Hi

1 Kat! Wake up!	What?

1 I guess I never told you I'm afraid of heights.	C'mon.  It's not that bad
2 Try lookin' at it from this angle

1 My grandmother's .	What?
2 That's where I was last year.  She'd never lived alone -- my grandfather died -- I stayed with her.  I wasn't in jail, I don't know Marilyn Manson, and I've never slept with a Spice Girl.  I spent a year sitting next to my grandma on the couch watching Wheel of Fortune.  End of story.

1 I don't understand the allure of dehydrated food.  Is this something I should be hip to?	No, Daddy.
2 So tell me about this dance. Was it fun?	Parts of it.
3 Which parts?	The part where Bianca beat the hell out of some guy.
4 Bianca did what?	What's the matter?  Upset that I rubbed off on her?
5 No -- impressed.

1 I think I speak correctly when I say that Cameron's love is pure.  Purer than say -- Joey Dorsey's.	Dorsey can plow whoever he wants. I'm just in this for the cash.

1 I don't understand, Patrick.  You haven't done anything asinine this week. Are you not feeling well?	Touch of the flu.
2 I'm at a loss, then.  What should we talk about? Your year of absence?

1 What just happened?	Your daughters went to the prom.
2 Did I have anything to say about it?	Absolutely not.
3 That ' s what I thought

1 Don't you realize your words could be considered heretical?	Blind faith is what I consider heresy!

1 Beatrix, I want to ask you something.	You don't usually ask.
2 I can arrange for the Queen to take Fernando and Diego into her service.

1 Do you swear on all the Holy Saints in heaven?	Yes... Yes, I do... On all of them!

1 They don't see sin in their nakedness.  They live according to nature, in a never ending summer. The islands are covered with trees, filled with blossoms and fruits. And...	Forgive me, Don Colon.  But what about gold?

1 To bring the word of God.	Chief says -- he has a God.
2 ... and also to bring medicine.	Chief says...
3 He has medicine.  Tell him we admire his people.

1 Colon!	Damn all of you!  You all set up theories based on what?  You never leave the safety of your studies! Go out!  Find out what the world is about and then tell me something I can listen to!

1 I cannot ignore the verdict of my council.	Surely you can do anything you want.

1 In one act of brutality, you have created chaos.  Tribes who were fighting each other are now joining forces against us!  All that because of your criminal savagery!	Savagery is what monkeys understand.
2 You'll be held in detention, deprived of your privileges and possessions.  Until you are returned to Spain where you will be judged. Have you anything to say?	You will regret this.

1 Every ship returns with a cargo of sick and dying.  But with no gold! The new world proves expensive, Your Majesty.	We weren't expecting immediate profits, were we?  We must have faith.  We must give time for time.

1 That's what he did to me.  He put cigarettes out on me.	Your father put cigarettes out on you?
2 Out on my back when I was a small boy.	Can I see your back?

1 I'm not a whore.  I'm not a whore.	I know.
2 You don't know.  I'm sorry.  I was desperate.  That's not me.  I shot a cop.  Can you imagine what they'll do to me when I got to prison?	They're not gonna send you right back.
3 I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to...I'm glad. Actually I'm glad it's over.  All this time.  Hiding.  Never being able to look anyone in the eyes. Always afraid that someone would find out who I was.  Never trusting anyone...

1 Are you here illegally?  Don't worry about that.  We'll talk to Immigration. They won't deport you.	No, no, don't talk to Immigration!

1 Coffee for me, I gotta slow down.	Vodka tonic.
2 Maybe you could just put in a shot of Martell?

1 Who's there?	Police.  We'd like to ask you a few questions.
2 I have nothin' to say.  If you wanna contact my attorney...	Homicide, Miss Hearn.  It's Detective Eddie Flemming.  Open up.

1 What would you call her?	Look, I'm not even sure she has anything to do with this.  I saw her outside after the fire - thought it was a lead. Maybe she saw something.  Maybe she was visiting somebody here.  Who knows?

1 She's fucked.  Even if that story is true.	Raw deal.

1 Detective - can you tell us what happened here?	I can't talk right now.  We have some things to take care of.

1 Sooner or later that's everybody.	Not chopped up.  Not chopped up like that.  I mean, what do I got left? Coupla articles.  A medal or two. Plaque here and there and in a coupla years no one remembers me anymore.
2 I think you're getting a little moody there, Eddie.	I'm not moody.

1 Were you a fireman?  That how you knew how to rig the apartment?	My father was.  He gave me many lessons about fire.  Now it's my friend.
2 Tommy, take a walk.

1 Next.  Could I see your documents, please?	Yes sir.

1 Look.  New videocameras.  Color viewfinder.  Image stabilization. Solarization.  Night vision.	We have no money.  Come on.

1 What is that?	What does it look like?  It's an address book!

1 I'm serious...this - this is a great American film.  Full of violence and sex.  And I want my credit.	Credit?
2 Yes.  Before we hand in the next video - I put titles on it and my credit is going to read - Directed by Oleg Razgul.	Yes.  But there's only one problem - you want credit but the problem is - I don't share credit.

1 Isn't he a little moody?	Of course he's moody.  He thinks he's in love.
2 In love?  With who?

1 I'll take him.	No way!  He's mine!
2 We're takin' him.  Don't argue!	He's my collar!
3 Well, he killed my partner!	He's yours but I take him in!  I'll drive him to the precinct, you can have him but I'm walkin' him in.

1 You see Eddie's face when I gave him the timer?  Wish I had a picture of it.	He knew all along.
2 What??	That's why he was so quiet.  He was testing us.

1 Take the car.  Get outta here, Tommy.	Look, you can't shoot him in cold blood.
2 GET OUTTA HERE NOW!!  GET IN THAT CAR AND DRIVE AWAY!!!  DO WHAT I SAY OR I'LL KILL YOU, TOO!!!

1 Dave, if you've a minute, I'd like your advice on something.	Sure, what is it?
2 Well, it's nothing really important, but it's annoying.	What's up?
3 It's about my salary cheques.	Yes?
4 Well I got the papers on my official up-grading to AGS-19 two weeks before we left.

1 It's the last one.	Well, now that we've got one that's actually failed, we should be able to figure out what's happened and fix it.

1 If you're determined to revive the crew now, I can handle the whole thing myself. There's no need for you to trouble.	I'm goin to do this myself, Hal. Let me have the control, please.
2 Look, Dave your've probably got a lot to do. I suggest you leave it to me.	Hal, switch to manual hibernation control.
3 I don't like to assert myself, Dave, but it would be much better now for you to rest. You've been involved in a very stressful situation.

1 I'm having a party tomorrow.	Yes, I know that sweetheart.
2 Are you coming to my party?	No, I'm sorry, darling, I told you I won't be home for a few days.
3 When are you coming home?	In three days, darling, I hope.

1 Well, thank you very much for being so understanding.	Please, it really doesn't matter.
2 Well.. Did you have a pleaant flight?	Yes, very pleasant.
3 Well, shall we go through Documentation?	Fine.

1 Yes, it does. The sub-surface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago.	How can you tell it was deliberately buried?
2 By the deformation between the mother rock and the fill.	Any clue as to what it is?
3 Not really. It's completely inert. No sound or energy sources have been detected. The surface is made of something incredibly hard and we've been barely able to scratch it. A laser drill

1 Five by five, Frank.	Hal, I'm going out now to replace the A.O. unit.
2 I understand.	Hal, maintain normal E.V.A. condition.
3 Roger.	Hal, check all airlock doors secure.

1 Now how's your memory doin'?	Fuck off.  I don't know what the hell you're talkin' about.
2 Maybe I better ask around, see what your pals think.	I don't give a shit who you ask.

1 You're in a hurry.	Yeah, i been waiting three years.
2 You just quit bein' a priest or somethin'?	No, baby, nothin' like that. Look, there's a place across the street. We can go right over there...
3 What's the matter with my place?	No, it's gotta be here and now. Believe me. Only I don't have the damn money for a room...

1 You lying son of a bitch...	What are you talking about? We didn't kill her ...

1 Hey, no way.  Take off the bracelets or no deal.	You just don't get it, do your Reggie?  There isn't any deal. I own your ass.
2 No way to start a partnership.	Get this.  We ain't partners. We ain't brothers.  We ain't friends. I'm puttin' you down and keepin' you down until Ganz is locked up or dead.  And if Ganz gets away, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
3 Shit.  I'm already sorry.

1 You really do have onoe, huh, Jack... what's her problem besides you?	She's got the same complaint as half the Goddamn population.  She can't get the job she's trained for and it pisses her off... Anyway, what the fuck do you care?

1 This place don't seem real popular with the brothers.	My kind of place. I always liked country boys.

1 We split 50-50?	Not likely, convict.
2 You gonna let me keep any of it?	Depends on how things work out. I believe in the merit system. So far you haven't built up any points.

1 I suppose you'd never be like Luther and let a woman get to you...	I let women get to me.  The quest for pussy is the meaning of life ... I got my own personal philosophy about 'em.  Keep women separate from guns, money and business ... women are for spending money.  They got nothing to do with helping you make it.
2 That ain't philosophy.  That's common sense.

1 What about Luther?	What about Ganz?

1 Sorry we didn't do better, Jack. I feel like I let you down.	Naw, you didn't let me down.  It was a long shot all the way.  We gave 'em a good run at it.
2 Yeah, but we didn't get 'em.

1 Thanks.	No trouble, Jack. But, listen, suppose I stay a crook?  Where'd you get the idea that you could catch me?

1 That's what you say, Cates...	Yeah.
2 But that's what you say about all of us all the tine ... we're always the ones fucking up when you tell it...	The truth hurts, doesn't it, buddy?

1 I got to wait for a call.	Okay.  See you in the morning... you know, you ought to get some rest...

1 A guy in the bar called me a dumb bitch today.	What'd you do?
2 Irrigated his face with the shot of J and B I'd just poured him. Then I tried to deck the sucker.	I guess he got the message...
3 Then I sit back and I think, I mean, who's to say I'm not a dumb bitch.  I work in a bar, right? I can't read a list of my academic credentials to every booze-hound that comes in the place... You are what you do...	Positive self-image problem all over again ... You are who you decide you are unless you're the type that lets assholes decide for you.
4 Aren't you the one that thinks all psychotherapy is bullshit?	I do think all psychotherapy is bullshit. But just because I think it's bullshit doesn't mean I don't know something about it.
5 If this is your idea of sympathetic interest in my problems, I'll take brutal indifference.	Hey, you know what I really think?
6 Tell me--I'm dyin' to hear it.	I think you're ashamed to tend bar which is sad because you look great in that outfit they make you wear... You pull down four bills a week which is damn good, and you mix the best Pina Coladas I've ever had... I think that if you need bigger and better things ... then go for em.

1 Just one.  Some lady called.  Said she's a little hot-headed sometimes... But she still wants her occasional roommate. She'd like to talk it over after she gets off work tonight... if it's humanly possible....	Elaine, look, I'm in the middle of sone stuff right now... I'm not gonna have time to come by. I don't know when I can get there.

1 Whaddya think?	What do I know?  I'm just a bartender.
2 Let's go, Reggie.

1 Stall.	What do you want?

1 You want to go outside?	Naw, right here's okay.

1 Vano da, mechteba?! Soun domo kala chon hammas!	No, I'm not proud of myself... But we don't have the luxury of choice.

1 Who are you?	I brought the girl remember?
2 The girl?

1 Imagine for a moment that this. thing is not anything that can be identified because it prefers not to be, because it is the antithesis of all we are. Because it is evil.. TOTAL EVIL.	One more reason to shoot first eh?

1 What's she doing?	Learning our history! The last 5000 years that she missed! She's been out of circulation a while, you know.

1 I'm sorry, but... the Stones...	They are... with me...

1 ...Priest...	You're not that bad... Come on we'll get you to a doctor.

1 I'm coming!. Ma, what're you talking about?	I get it! You want to make me beg, is that it?
2 All I want is an explanation! I just got in, I lost my job. I smashed my cab. I got mugged, but other than that everything's peachy, Ma, thanks for asking!! Now settle down and explain to me calmly..

1 ...Quiver ladies, he's gonna set the world on fire right here from 5 to 7! You'll know everything there is to know about the D-man. His dreams, his desires, his most intimate of intimates.  And from what I'm looking at intimate is the stud muffin's middle name. So tell me my main man... you nervous in the service?	Uh... not really.

1 What did you say? What did you do?	Nothing! Swear to God, I didn't do nothing!
2 Look, you did something that set it off. Try to remember. Concentrate. Tell me exactly what you did!!

1 Valo massa... Chacha hamas.	Uh..you're welcome.

1 I told you I need to work in peace. Remember? I need to concentrate.	And you can't concentrate with me around?.
2 It's difficult.

1 The cash man!	Been here long?
2 Don't fuck with me man or I'll blow you into tomorrow!

1 I want your best man on this!	Don't worry, Sir. I have the perfect one.

1 How's that? Can you hear me better now?	Yes, Mr. Zorg, I hear you perfectly! So, how was the concert?
2 Who gives a shit! I didn't come here to listen to music! Listen up instead of running off at the mouth! The batteries on my phone are almost gone.	Yes, Sir!
3 Dispatch me another ZFX200 immediately. Someone stole mine.	Right away, Sir. I'll send you a new one to the hotel.
4 I'm not at the hotel!

1 This is the mortgage.  This is Cindy's college money.	I understand.
2 Sometimes you can't know what I'm doing.  It's better that way.	I know.
3 It's a missing persons case... a long shot.  I'll give it two months, two months at most, then I'll be back.  We'll take a vacation.	Why the gun?
4 I'm not gonna need it.  I won't even wear it.  It's a precaution.  Don't worry about me.

1 Anything harder?	There's nothing harder.
2 Snuff?	What you see is what I got, mister.
3 You know where I can get it?  I have a lot of money to spend.	There ain't no such thing as snuff. Why don't you fuck off?

1 Where's that?	Brooklyn.  Don't be late.

1 Don't let Longdale's questionable choice of weapon give you any ideas. If his fey little gun puts enough little holes in you, you'll be just as dead... and so will Max.	Move it, dirtbag... !

1 I'm gonna kill you.	Don't bore me with that bullshit.
2 How'd you find me here?

1 You know how my tapes sell.  People eat this stuff up.	I had three jerkoffs trying to return your tapes last month.  Do you know how bad a skin flick has to be for some jackass to come back into my place with a fucking receipt, and try to fucking return it?
2 Maybe there's something wrong with the scumbag customers coming into your place, ever think of that?	The only thing wrong is the cheap, softcore crap you're peddling, Eddie.  Where do you get this stuff?
3 Look, you cocksucker...	Get together some upscale product where the girls still have teeth in their head.  Till then, fuck you.
4 Fuck you!

1 Big date tonight?	Yeah... guess so.
2 Can I interest you in a battery operated-vagina?	Pardon me?
3 My boss tells me I have to do more suggestive selling.	Well, it's tempting, but no thanks.
4 It's your call, but you're gonna be sorry when you're in one of those everyday situations that call for a battery-operated vagina and you don't have one.	I'll risk it.

1 Dino Velvet... yeah, he's like the John Luc Godard of S+M flicks, supposed to be a real weirdo.	A weirdo making S+M films?  Who'd have thought it?
2 His stuff comes out of New York. Bondage and fetish videos, Gothic Hardcore.  Definitely not for the squeamish.	Specialty product.
3 You're learning.	Where does he sell it?
4 Out of the back of bondage magazines mostly, but you can find it on the street if you look.  He'll also do commissions, for enough money...	Nothing illegal, it's always borderline.  Like if some freak wants to see a transvestite in a full rubber immersion suit getting an enema from a...
5 Alright, I get the picture.	He cuts all kinds of other stuff into his movies; photographs, newsreel footage, subliminal images. Thinks he's making art.
6 Well, I'm in New York now.  What do you say to flying out and giving me a hand?	I'm a working stiff, pops.
7 Take a vacation.  I'll pay you four hundred a day, plus expenses.	You want me to come out there and play private eye?
8 Consider it.  Meanwhile, dig up whatever Dino Velvet films you can. Get receipts.  I'll call back.	See ya.

1 Mister Welles. You're very prompt.	I try to be.

1 I didn't know what to think.  I can't tell you how horrible it's been, to know this belonged to my husband.  To know that he watched this... this atrocity.  But, I can't go to the police...	Mrs. Christian... please, will you sit down a moment?  I want you to listen carefully. What you're talking about is a "snuff film."  But, from what I know, snuff films are a kind of... urban myth.  Like, red light district folklore.  There's no such thing, I can assure you.

1 I've been hired as an independent contractor by the U.S. Resource Center for Missing Persons as part of an internal audit.  If you have any time over the next few days, I'd like to make an appointment to ask some questions about the disappearance of your daughter.	I don't understand, who are... ?
2 I'm sorry, let me explain, the R.C.M.P. is a support organization and archive, not unlike the Center for Missing and Exploited Children in Washington.  I'm sure you've dealt with them before?	Yes, but...
3 These volunteer organizations are sort of interconnected, functioning hand in hand with law enforcement. The R.C.M.P. brought me in to review their investigations...  ... fact-check their records, see if there's anything they missed, anything they should be doing different.  I'm here for a few days, before I head back up to Virginia. These reports go to the Justice Department eventually.  I spoke to your F.B.I. contact a few days ago, uh...

1 You were right.  I didn't find anything.  I'm going to run and get something to eat. Are you hungry?	Yes.

1 The um... you'll find my invoice in the envelope. If that's all...	Yes, Mister Welles, thank you.
2 Certainly, Senator.  If I can ever be of further assistance.

1 Hey, since when do you play Thomas Edison?  This looks like Sheila's.	It is...was. It's a zapper, it might help me stay awake.
2 Yeah, or turn you into toast.

1 Ohhhhbaby, I am dead on my feet.	We have matching luggage.
2 What?

1 Not really.	Is there something we can do?
2 I don't think so.  I guess this is my own war.

1 Asthma attack...what 17-year old has a fatal asthma attack?  She was gonna be a doctor.	It was Freddy.
2 Enough of that crap.	I saw it. It was my dream.  I brought Sheila in...

1 Something wrong with the stairs?	Avoid-all-contact-day.
2 What?	When dad's popping aspiring like popcorn, it's avoid-all-contact-day.

1 We know you've been through a lot but there's more than your feelings at stake here.	You're not taking my baby!

1 Where is he?	He's inside you, where he hides.

1 Where are we going?	To take a picture.

1 What's that got to do with it?	When Dan died you weren't even asleep. You said so.  End of story.

1 You think that's the place she's buried?	If they actually bothered to bury her.

1 I want to talk to both you guys about Greta.  And...	I'm very fucking sorry, but Greta is dead today.  Could we interest you in someone else?

1 They think I'm nuts.	That's their problem.

1 These things are wild...  What do you think?	Makes you look like a nun--

1 You, too?	He invited me to his house last night.

1 They're so remote - cold - beautiful, the stars.  But now - I wonder -	Yes?
2 Which is the one - we have to worry about?

1 You all wait here.  I'm going inside, take a look.	Not <u>alone</u>, you're not!

1 Dave - !	What's goin' on in here, Lad? What - ?

1 Now they feel it...down below.	Radiation level...constantly rising...

1 I'm - afraid I have some bad news for you, Reef -  You'll have to share quarters, this trip.	Who with?
2 Dr. Neilsen.  He'll be - -

1 What's the corrected bearing to the Magnetic Pole?	Minus three.

1 See what?	The pattern.  Each incident occurred almost precisely a thousand statute miles from the Pole.  A line through the points of occurrence makes almost a complete circle...

1 This is from three years ago. Some difference, huh?	What is the Northcountry Development Association?
2 I went down to Concord to check it out. The president is Mel Gordon. The vice-president and treasurer is Gordon LaRiviere. Those boys are buying up the mountain, Wade. $364,000 this year. I believe that's out of LaRiviere's league.	Twombley involved?
3 No.	He musta found out. They had to get rid of him. And Jack'll get blamed.
4 All the figures show is that Gordon LaRiviere is going to be a very rich man using his position as Selectman. In a year or two, you won't recognize this town.

1 I'm okay.	Follow close. We'll cross the next meadow.

1 Aw, shit, she's here to get Jill. Me and Jill had a little argument. Jack, I got to get back, get back to town. Move this thing, will you? See if you can get back to the Town Hall before they get there, okay?	Piece of fucking cake.

1 She's gone already!  Gone already! Couldn't wait.	Yes.
2 That's all you got to say? "Yes".	Yes.
3 She won't be here for a half hour. Think you can stand it that long?	Yes.
4 Where do you expect to wait for her? Obviously downstairs with the other kids isn't good enough.

1 Tomorrow, Gordon.	Watch this snow. It's coming down tonight.

1 Wade, you're done.  Let me have the shop keys.	You two, don't you get it? He's using you. You're his slaves.  Jesus Christ, Jack, don't you see that?
2 The key, Wade.	Yeah, you can have the key. It's the key that's kept me locked to you all these years. I give it to you with pleasure.  Now I'm free. See how easy it is, Jack? All you got to do is give back what the man gave you, and you're free of him.  I've got to call my brother.

1 Don't worry. I can protect my virtue. I mean, c'mon, Wade, give me a break.	See you tomorrow, maybe.
2 You okay?	Yeah.

1 Strange.	Think they're alright?
2 Of course! I would've heard.	How?
3 I don't know for Christ's sake!

1 Who are you?	I was... I'm Wade Whitehouse. I was wondering, is your husband here?
2 He's asleep. We were up very late.	Well, yes, I'm... I want to say that I'm real sorry about your father, Mrs. Twombley.
3 Mrs. Gordon. Thank you.	Well, yeah, I suppose. Sure. I just had a little business to settle with Mr. Gordon. I'm the local police officer.
4 Something about my father?	Oh, no. No, it's a... it's a traffic thing. No big deal.
5 Can't it wait, then?

1 Jesus, Pop, how can you stand the cold, dressed like that? Where's Ma?	Sleeping.
2 You remember Margie Fogg?	From Wickham's. Been a while. Like some coffee?
3 How you and Ma doing? Haven't seen you in town for a while.	We're alright. Your Ma's sleeping. You want me to get her?
4 Yeah.

1 Lillian was here. In Lawford.	Huh?
2 The night before the shooting.	How was she?
3 Picked up Jill. She was supposed to visit for the weekend for Halloween. She wanted to go home.	Who?
4 Jill. I was thinking of getting a lawyer. Maybe you can help me.	What happened?
5 A divorce lawyer. A custody lawyer. You know, 'cause of Jill.

1 I know what it means. I'm just running out of ways to use it.	For what?

1 Daddy. Daddy, please...	Jim... for godsake!

1 How you doing, sweetie?	Been better, Dad... You?

1 Who's flying the fucking plane?	I'm doing what I can.

1 Apparently taking uzis away from sixth graders isn't as popular as we thought it'd be.  Representative Taylor is working on a compromise.	Put together a score sheet.  I'll make some calls.

1 Air Force One, please reduce speed to 250 knots.	Roger.

1 We copy. Stand by...  Tower?	Tower, here.
2 This is Romeo Tango Zulu changing call signs.  Tower, alert air traffic, Romeo Tango Zulu is now Air Force One.  This is Air Force One... The President is safe onboard.	Copy, Air Force One.

1 Leave my daughter alone.	Or you will do what, Mrs. Marshall?  But I admire your courage. Your husband, on the other hand...
2 What do you know of my husband?	I know he left you behind.
3 My husband is a very courageous man.	Your husband is a coward. He sends soldiers half-way around the world to steal a man from his home in the middle of the night.

1 This administration does not negotiate with terrorists.	Pity. Mr. Gibbs.

1 The northern border's gotten a bit hairy. Their MiGs are playing tag with our Tomcats and our boys are just itching to engage.	Tell our boys to cool their jets. I don't need `em creating policy for me.

1 I'll make it up to you, I promise.	I should trust that promise? Because you know the voters are still waiting for that middle class tax cut.
2 This promise isn't subject to Congressional approval.

1 and if that means negotiating...	You know my policy. We don't negotiate with terrorists. If we start now, all of America becomes a target.
2 But this is different, sir. You're the President.

1 I said it's not worth the fight.  Steward, please.	We'll just say it was in bad taste.

1 IT'S OPEN!	DO YOU SEE TEEM?

1 Oveur.	Dunn.

1 Elaine, what happened to us?	Ted, I loved you and I'll always love you. But I need Simon.  He's stable.  He's a good provider.  I want that at this stage of the game, Ted.  He might have his faults, but Simon doesn't know the meaning of the word fear and I need that in a man.

1 Ted, get a grip on yourself.  You should never have left the hospital.	Then you <u>do</u> think I'm insane.
2 I've never used the word insane, Ted.	What word would you use, Elaine?
3 The word is sick.  Ted -- very, very, very sick.	What would you say if I told you the toilet just blew up in my face.
4 I'd use the word insane.	There's something dangerously wrong with this ship, Elaine.  I know its the wiring. That toilet's just the tip of the iceberg.
5 Ted, a toilet's not going to kill anyone.

1 Ted seemed to get worse after I told him about Simon, Doctor.	The human brain is a highly complex organ, Elaine, perhaps the most complex next to the bladder.  Let me show you.  Ted's problem is in this area.  This area, this area, here, here, here, under here, here...

1 Simon, I'm going to check ROK's secondary readout unit.	Roger.

1 Will Scraps be able to sit with us, Dad?	We'll have to check, Jimmy.  It's a pretty long trip to Mercury.

1 No, a bomb.  Now, as discreetly as possible, I want you to move the passengers into the lounge.	What should I say?
2 Anything.  Just don't let Salucci think we're onto him.

1 Striker.	Kurtz, you're drunk.  Who's in command of this ship?
2 That damn computer has taken over.  I'm getting out.	Then Elaine was right.
3 Don't talk to me about Elaine.  Outta my way!	Pull yourself together!  We've got to...

1 Shep, sit...sit! So, I understand you've got a real emergency down there.	Well, to tell the truth, they really didn't fill me in on many of the details. Just told me to pick up Captain Kramer.
2 Something about a plane with no pilot?

1 What is it, Doctor? What's happening?	I'm not sure. I haven't seen anything like this since the Lina Wertmuller Film Festival.

1 Look, you'll be back in town tomorrow night. We'll have dinner -- talk it over.	I won't be back. I've requested the Atlanta run.
2 Elaine, not yet. I promise you I really can change.	Then why don't you take the job that Louie Netz offered you at Boeing?

1 What's his problem?	That's Lieutennt Hurwitz. Severe shell shock. He thinks he's Ethel Merman.

1 We have a visitor.	Hello.

1 Jack, isn't that Fred Bliffert over there in the blue turtleneck? Maybe he's on our flight to Chicago.	Yeah, I think he is.  Hey, Fred!

1 Sorry, Clarence. Latest weather report shows everything socked in from Salt Lake to Lincoln.	Hi, Roger. Good to have you aboard. Victor, this is Roger Murdock.

1 Excuse me, sir. There's been a little problem in the cockpit and I was wondering...	The cockpit? What is it?
2 It's the little room at the front of the plane where the pilots sit. But that's not important right now. The first officer is ill and the Captain would like someone with flying experience to help him with the radio. Do you know anything about planes?

1 In there.	Show me.

1 ... and we work my hours.  I'll do the driving, you do the paperwork. You gotta learn it so you might as well do it all.	Sergeant... I'd like to thank you for what you're doing.
2 What's that?  Look, Jetson.  Get this straight in your head.  We're not pals, we're not married, and we ain't gonna take long moonlight walks together... We're just partners.  And don't call me Sergeant.  Call me Sykes... or Matt if you have to.	I am George.

1 Get the picture?	And that fits?
2 Well... Yeah, it's rubber.  It stretches.	And still it fits?

1 You know that guy?	From quarantine, when my people first arrived here.  He and I were housed together.
2 How could a straight-arrow like you ever pick a roommate like him?	In the camps, we were lodged four to a room.  The selection process was entirely random.  We did not get to stay with our friends... or families...

1 Your home is quite disordered.  I thought perhaps you had been burglarized when I walked in.	I appreciate your honesty, George.

1 Stop the car.	Why?
2 Please, I must get out here.	Come on, you won't have to get near the water.
3 Stop the car!

1 George, uh... you're gonna break his little chest bones...	Stay out of this, Matthew.  Tell me where the drug has been taken or I will crush your lungs against this wall.

1 You said you wanted the biggest thing I could find... Well, this is it.	What is it?
2 Casull .454 Magnum.  You're talking twice the impact energy of .44 Magnum hot loads.	Only holds five.
3 Yeah, the shells are too big for six in an cylinder.  Hell, Matt, you don't need but one.	No... two.

1 You know I've been over all this with Fedorchuk and Alterez this morning...	Come on.  You got nothin' better to do, cushy county job like yours.

1 Hope their plumbing's the same.	It is. 

1 ...that's better.  Pan it around a bit.	Awright.  Fire-team A.  Gear up. Let's move.  Two minutes. Somebody wake up Hicks.

1 I'll go.	What?
2 I'm really the only one qualified to remote-pilot the ship anyway. Believe me, I'd prefer not to.  I may be synthetic but I'm not stupid.	All right.  Let's get on it.  What'll you need?

1 You had them eating out of your hand, kiddo.	They had their minds made up before I even went in there. They think I'm a head case.
2 You are a head case.  Have a donut.

1 No good.  How do we know it'll effect their biochemistry?  I say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit.  It's the only way to be sure.	Now hold on a second.  I'm not authorizing that action.
2 Why not?

1 We're talking thermonuclear explosion.	Shit.  Apone, collect magazines from everybody.  We can't have any firing in there.

1 At ease.  I'm sorry we didn't have time to brief before we left Gateway but...	Sir?
2 Yes, Hicks?	Hudson, Sir.  He's Hicks.
3 What's the question?	Is this going to be a stand-up fight, Sir, on another bug-hunt?
4 All we know is that there's still no contact with the colony and that a xenomorph may be involved.

1 We got problems.	I don't fucking believe this. Do you believe this?

1 Now many?	Can't tell.  Lots.  D gun's down to twenty.  Ten.  It's out.

1 Hicks, don't let him leave.	We ain't going anywhere.

1 You can't help them.  Right now they're being cocooned just like the others.	Oh, God.  Jesus.  This ain't happening.

1 Twelve meters.  Man, this is a big fucking signal.  Ten meters.	They're right on us.  Vasquez, how you doing?

1 I guess we're not leaving, right?	I'm sorry, Newt.
2 You don't have to be sorry.  It wasn't your fault.

1 Come on.  Crawl faster.	DO you know how to get to the landing field from here?
2 Sure.  Go left.

1 A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish. Be my most tasty little dish! Be my most tasty little dish!	Then that would be eating and drinking I'd live like a Prince without thinking. The wisdom of old would be mine - A woman's much better than wine! Then that would be eating and drinking!

1 Is she a good fuck?	What??
2 I assume she's the virtuoso in that department. There can't be any other reason you'd marry someone like that.

1 Your Grace, I've got something to tell you. I want to complain about this man.	Go ahead, tell him. Tell them all. They won't understand you anyway.
2 Why not?	Because here everything goes backwards. People walk backwards, dance backwards, sing backwards, and talk backwards.
3 That's stupid.	Why? People fart backwards.
4 Do you think that's funny?	Yes, I think it's brilliant. You've been doing it for years.

1 We'll have a little party. Come in. Come in. You know Herr Schikaneder?  This is! a very nice girl.	Wolfi.
2 Yes, my love?	These gentlemen are from Salzburg.
3 Salzburg.  We were just talking about Salzburg.  If you've come from my friend the Fartsbishop, you've arrived at just the right moment. Because I've got good news for him. I'm done with Vienna. It's over, finished, done with! Done with! Done with!	Wolfi! Your father is dead.
4 What?	Your father is dead.

1 Frau Mozart?	That's right, Your Excellency. I've come on behalf of my hus band. I'm - I'm bringing some samples of his work so he can be considered for the royal appointment.
2 How charming.  But why did he not come himself?	He's terribly busy, sir.
3 I understand.

1 What are you doing here?	Your husband is ill, ma'am. He took sick. I brought him home.
2 Why you?	I was at hand.
3 Well, thank you very much. You can go now.	He needs me, ma'am.
4 No, he doesn't. And I don't want you here. Just go, please.	He asked me to stay.
5 And I'm asking you -

1 He's adorable!	Adorable!

1 Really?	Ah, now! Here she comes.

1 Good morning, Court Composer. This is my niece, the Princess Elizabeth.	Your Highness.

1 Why so?	Because I've already found the most wonderful libretto!

1 Bravo, Mozart. Most charming. Yes, indeed. Clever man.	Thank you, Sire!

1 I write to you with urgent news. I am coming to Vienna. Take no further steps toward marriage until we meet. You are too gullible to see your own danger. As you honour the father who has devoted his entire life to yours, do as I bid, and await my coming.	I will.

1 I'm tired of this game. Please play without me.	But my penalty. I've got to have a penalty.

1 I think I've found out about the money, sir.	Yes what?

1 I'm serious. You write a proper part for me with a couple of catchy songs, I'll guarantee you'll have a triumph- de-luxe. Mind you, it'll have to be in German.	German!
2 Of course! What else do you think they speak here?	No, no, I love that. I'd want it to be in German. I haven't done anything in German since Seraglio.
3 So there you are. What do you say?

1 I'm sorry. No.	Please. I'll give it back, I promise. Please, sir.
2 My answer is no, Mozart.

1 Mozart. It was good of you to come.	How could I not?
2 Did my work please you?	How could it not, Excellency?
3 Yes?	I never knew that music like that was possible.
4 You flatter me.	Oh no! One hears such sounds and what can one say, but - Salieri!

1 Where did I stop?	The end of the Recordare - Statuens in parte dextra.
2 So now the Confutatis. Confutatis Maledictis. When the wicked are confounded. Flammis acribus addictis. How would you translate that?	Consigned to flames of woe.
3 Do you believe in it?	What?
4 A fire which never dies. Burning one forever?	Oh, yes.
5 Strange!	Come. Let's begin.

1 C Major. Sopranos and altos in thirds. Altos on C. Sopranos above.  Vo-ca, vo-ca me, vo-ca me cum be-ne- dic-tis.	Sopranos up to F on the second 'Voca'?
2 Yes, and on 'dictis'.	Yes!

1 Can we see the scene with the music back, please?	Oh yes, certainly. Certainly, Herr Director!

1 Oh, I know that! That's charming!  I didn't know you wrote that.	I didn't. That was Mozart. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. You know who that is?
2 Of course. The man you accuse yourself of killing.	Ah - you've heard that?
3 All Vienna has heard that.	And do they believe it?
4 Is it true?	Do you believe it?
5 Should I?

1 What anger?	About the ballet.
2 Ballet? What ballet?	Excuse me - didn't His Majesty specifically forbid ballet in his opera?
3 Yes, absolutely. Is there a ballet in Figaro?	Yes, in the third act.

1 What does he want?	He didn't say, sir. I told him I didn't know when you would be back, but he insisted on waiting.
2 Come with me. And stay in the room.

1 He's not?	Alex, has David persisted in his werewolf fantasies?
2 Well, yes, but he seems to be more upset by the death of his friend.	Has his friend appeared to him again?
3 Yes.	What did he say?
4 David says Jack comes to warn him.	Warn him?
5 Dr. Hirsch, what's wrong? Is this more serious than I know?	I tried to investigate the attack. There are no records. The case was closed and now they've 'misplaced' the file. David's lacerations were cleaned and dressed when he arrived here and yet supposedly no doctor examined him before I did. The Goodman boy is already in the ground so he's no good to us. So I went to the pub in East Proctor where I was convinced of two things.
6 Yes.	They were lying. There were no witnesses, no escaped lunatic. The whole community is hiding the truth of what actually happened up there.
7 And what else?	I think the village of East Proctor is hiding some dark and terrible secret. I'm convinced that, like David, they believe in this werewolf.

1 Call me David.	Shall I be forced to feed you, David?
2 This is absurd. I'm not hungry. I don't want any food.	Right.

1 Closet.	Charming.
2 Bathroom.	Lovely.
3 The bedroom.	There is only one bed.
4 David, perhaps you'd like to watch the telly while I take a shower.

1 The next corner we can get a cab.	I should be committed.
2 Dr. Hirsch will know what to do.	I don't know why I feel so good. I haven't felt this good in a long time.

1 Feeling better?	No.
2 The doctor will be round later. Would you like a picture book to look at? We have some lovely funny Beanos.	No.
3 Right.

1 You be quiet, woman, and let me speak.	Quiet, everyone! Hush! Shhh!

1 You've never had bad dreams before?	Sure, as a kid. But never so real. Never so bizarre.

1 What about it?	It's a five-pointed star.
2 Maybe the owners are from Texas.

1 Could be a lot of things.	Yeah?
2 A coyote.	There aren't any coyotes in England.
3 The Hound of the Baskervilles.	Pecos Bill.
4 Heathcliffe.	Heathcliffe didn't howl.
5 No, but he was on the moors.	It's a full moon, 'beware the moon'.

1 Jack?	Yeah.
2 Where are we going?	I'll tell you when we get there.
3 Well. I'm glad we... WHOAA!!

1 David Kessler, this is Gerald Bringsly.	Hello.
2 Gerald is the man you murdered in the subway. We thought it best you didn't see him as he's a fresh kill and still pretty messy.

1 Hello, there. What can I get you?	Campari and soda would do nicely.
2 Sorry, love.	I suppose Guinness will suffice.

1 What do you suppose anybody wants? Money, money, money!	Listen, I told you I wasn't interested in that deal, didn't I?
2 I want to know why .

1 What's the matter, Charlie?	I'm fourteen cents out, and it took me half an hour to find the mistake. And me with a date, too.
2 I remember once when your account checked.	Yeah.

1 Most of the creditors I know personally. I've seen them grow up in the community. I knew their fathers and mothers before them.	I know, Dickson. That's all very well. But you're taking too many chances. In these times a bank should keep liquid in case of trouble. In case of emergency!

1 Thanks.	Somebody must be in good humor. He was humming "Mother Machree."
2 It's one of the boys from headquarters. He always sings "Mother Machree" whenever he's got good news. Looks like this case'll be settled in no time.

1 Good heavens, man! You're not suggesting that I	Why not?
2 Why, I couldn't do that . . . !	You don't have to do nothing.

1 What?	Don't you know I've been crazy about you for years?
2 Now wait a minute, wait a minute...	I've loved you ever since I can remember, long before you married Tom Dickson.
3 Why, Cyril, you're insane	No. No, I'm not. I deliberately avoided you. I was afraid of making a fool of myself. But I won't stand it any longer
4 Cyril!

1 Phyllis, you don't have to explain anything.  You'd do well to mind your own business.	This is my business. Mr. Dickson's been like a father to me.  What has he ever done to you to deserve a deal like this?
2 That will be just about enough! Now get out of here!	I guess I have said enough  I'm just wasting my breath talking to you.

1 All right. I'll postpone the whole thing until tomorrow night.	Happy now?
2 No.

1 Yes?	Helen, I'm going to Philadelphia, just as soon as the bank closes. Make all the arrangements, will you?
2 Yes, sir.

1 What's the matter? You don't seem very excited about it.	Sure, I think it's swell.
2 Say, come on. Show a little enthusiasm. What's the matter? Are you sick or something? Go on, fake it - even if it isn't real.

1 That's what he says. I got a man from headquarters checking up on it now.	Good.  You've got nothing to worry about. Soon as the report comes in, you'll be released.  And listen, don't talk so loud. Take it easy. Coast a little.

1 The bank's reputation wouldn't be worth a nickel after that. This is just a flurry, that's all. They've heard about the robbery and got panic-stricken. Listen, get a hold of our available securities and have them turned into cash. Wait a minute. Get my personal stuff and have that turned into cash too. Tell the boys anyone caught arguing with a depositor will be fired on the spot.	Yes, sir.

1 Hey, look out, somebody's likely to see us!	Oh, is that so?

1 Oh, Matt . . .	Don't cry, honey. Everything's gonna be all right.

1 Listen here, young man - nobody ever called me a liar yet and got away with it	That's all, Mrs. Halligan. Thanks.

1 You can ride like that?	I said like a Comanche, not this Comanche.

1 These are deeds and mortgages of farms the bank was holding for the railroad.	Better pass them over here before something happens to 'em.

1 My plan of lying here pissing myself seems to be working mighty fine, thank you.	I can hit those boys from here. We just need a distraction.

1 But if we take their money and supplies...	Exactly.

1 'Bout time you got here, buddy.	What's going on?

1 This isn't a feud, this is war. They've got more men than we do. We kill detectives, they can replace 'em in a day.	So what do we do, General Lee?
2 Just like in the war. Harass their supply lines. We kill the railroad's men, they won't care.

1 Smells funny, it being mentioned in the paper.	If you'd read about it first, you'd have no problems.
2 What are you saying?	I've robbed just as many banks as you have! I know this town, and I know this bank, and I say it's an easy job.
3 You're forgetting who's in charge --

1 You know, you gettin' caught, right after leaving us, some people thought --	Pff. All we been through, the thought never crossed my mind.

1 BASTARDS! Come back here and face me!	Get buckets!

1 What the --	What is it?
2 Old Man Tucker is just standing quiet outside the bank.	So?
3 When have you ever known Old Man Tucker not to be yelling at everybody?

1 He thinks this is some kind of game!	I'm upset too, Zee, but Jesse and Cole know what they're doing. I'm sure they won't press their luck.

1 "Big and older"?	You can shut up now.
2 You are a charmer.	I swear I'll shoot you in your sleep.
3 Next time try "fat and haggard."

1 And I planned getting you off the hangman's deck --	And that's why you both lead the gang. Two of you went into that bank together, right?

1 I'll meet you down there in a few weeks.	See you soon. Oh, and I appreciate the distraction back there.
2 Hell, they hardly even noticed us.

1 Doc Mimms will --	Shush.

1 Zee.	Jesse. What are you thinking? There are bounty hunters and lawmen all over this county!
2 I had to see you. I'm getting married.

1 You almost ended my career before it began.	Pity.

1 I like that.	No.

1 Relax, Alan. The Army has this all in hand. And Mr. Thaddeus Rains will be very pleased with this news. Nothing like a hanging to motivate the populace to relocate.	It's not my job to relax. I've put men facing out both ways down Main Street, so nobody can ride in shooting. I've got a sharpshooter up on the water tower just in case.

1 Parker.	Sir?
2 What is that?	What, sir?

1 Yes, that's the way to win the locals back to our side.	I demand action.
2 No, you demand results. They are not the same thing. And if you want results, you will let me do my job as I see fit. Unless of course,  You want this fool to saddle up and take another run at it?	Can't you tell me anything?
3 It's going to be a long spring.

1 It's a plain end. I think.	Turn the light on.

1 You have a really nice place here...Paul. How much did you pay for it?	Actually, that's none of your business, Christie, hut I can assure you it certainly wasn't cheap.

1 Why? What's wrong?	My need to engage in homicidal behavior on a massive scale cannot be, um, corrected, but I have no other way to fulfill my needs.

1 Because he dated her.	How did you guess?
2 Girls dig Bateman. He's CQ. You're total CQ, Bateman.	Thanks, guy, but...she's got a lousy personality.

1 It was a pretty long message, wasn't it?	What exactly do you mean?
2 The message you left.

1 Van Patten looks puffy. Has he stopped working out?	It looks that way, doesn't it?

1 Yes, Caron's right. Gorbachev's not downstairs. He's at Tunnel.	Ask me a question.

1 Okay, Jean. I need reservations for three at Camols at twelve-thirty, and if not there, try Crayons. All right?	Yes, sir.

1 Anywhere you want?	Let's not think about what I want. How about anywhere you want.
2 Oh Patrick, I can't make this decision.	No, come on. Anywhere you want.
3 Oh, I can't.  I don't know.	Come on. Where do you want to go? Anywhere you want. Just say it. I can get us in anywhere.

1 Yes. I don t think I can...control myself.	I know I should go. I know I have a tendency to get involved with unavailable men, and...I mean, do you want me to go?

1 Well, I mean, um, it s really...Bosco. You know, like... like a Dove Bar. It's a Dove Bar...Hershey's Syrup?	Oh yeah. Oh I get it. Fun with chocolate.
2 Listen, if you could talk to them  I would really appreciate it. I'm really late. I have a lunch appointment at Hubert's in fifteen minutes.

1 Listen, John, I've got to go. T Boone Pickens just walked in...  Just joking...  No don't tip the owner of the salon. Okay, John, right, got it.  Sorry about that.	No, I'm sorry. I should've made an appointment.  Was that anything important?
2 Oh that? Just mulling over business problems. Examining opportunities...Exchanging rumors... Spreading gossip.

1 How well did you know him?	I'm...at a loss. He was part of that whole...Yale thing, you know.
2 Yale thing?

1 I mean they want to get caught.	Dan, great to see you again. Like I said, you need anything at all, I'm your man. I don't envy your job. I mean Owen was a...complex man.

1 I'm so hungry.	It's cold out, too, isn't it?
2 I'm so hungry.	Why don't you get a job? If you're so hungry, why don't you get a job?
3 I lost my job...	Why? Were you drinking? Is that why you lost it? Insider trading? Just joking. No, really-were you drinking on the job?

1 Hey, Halberstam?	Yes, Owen?
2 Why are there copies of the Style section all over the place? Do you have a dog? A chow or something?	No, Owen.
3 Is that a raincoat?	Yes, it is.

1 It's important.	If he's really a bully, he won't cop to it, anyway.
2 Bully? Are we talking about Gary Boyd? Or your dad.

1 What!	Teddy was killed last night.
2 What're you -- what?	It was a hate crime.

1 Are you gonna tell me where you went?	I went to see the Skywire model in Gary's office. You know. Just to hold it again.

1 Mr. Barton, do you remember me?	...It's -- Milo, isn't it?
2 Yes sir. I need to talk to you.	Give me two seconds with Lacy here?  Go on in, I won't be a moment.

1 Is it your software?	Is it your dish?

1 You know a lot about art, I guess.	There's a rumor going around, maybe you've heard it.

1 Milo. What's up?	Well -- you sent for me.
2 Right... Right.

1 No. I just went deeper into the machine. Preferred being the geek to having to explain. Lying would've been worse.	...Worse?
2 Cause he was a liar. And I hated him.  "Get your head out of that machine, wise up to the real world." The more he mocked me the deeper I went. Cause if being savvy meant being like him --  Guess that's why I'm kind of clueless, even now. Didn't cultivate my conniving side. 'Not sure I even have one.	Don't be so hard on yourself. With a brain like yours, you could connive with the best of 'em I bet.

1 Help me change the Skywire settings. Add five degrees to each satellite coordinate.	Gary, don't worry, we --
2 Just do what I'm asking!

1 Delbert seems to enter #21 twice. Without leaving the first time.	Let's get him in here.

1 They just pushed up the schedule on Skywire apps. How fast are you going?	"There is no second place." Plus every time I get jammed-up, Gary has an inspiration.  Is it like that with your counselor?
2 Mine's not the CEO. He barely remembers to take a shower.	Right, right. But does he ever just, like, hand you code?
3 Maybe once. I re-wrote it, anyway.	You're compulsive.
4 Mmm-more like -- I have a little trouble. Trusting people.	Why's that?
5 Long story. Not that interesting.

1 The mainstream media. TV, or a newsmagazine.	Right. But Gary's tied-in to a lot of media conglomerates. Have to be careful who we pick.
2 We could cross-reference a data base on media ownership. But not on our own computers. Not even at home.	Certainly not at my happy home.

1 Great. I knocked off the aglet, as soon as I get a passable version of Skywire we're there.	The dishes are juiced up, too.
2 Thank God.	Milo? Shrot suspects somebody broke into #21. I was in his office when he was reviewing the card readouts.
3 They know I broke in. Alice helped me.  Shrot's not one of them. He's blundering into this on his own.	He doesn't know about the Day Care.
4 Hardly anybody does, that's the beauty part. No cameras, the DOJ doesn't bother with it, it's accessed by a tunnel they boast about. You know the best place to hide a leaf?	Yeah, that's old, in a tree.
5 Oh.	Milo? What if Shrot notices somebody entered the Day Care at four A.M.? And tells them about it?

1 We rented a loft in Sunnyvale.  You know what's the bad part? We can't talk about work anymore. We're competitors! The venture capitalists made us sign like 100 confidentiality forms.	Outpost made me sign 1,000. 'Guess we'll find out what else we have to talk about. Life stuff.

1 What is it?	Not much. Glorified cherry bomb. Right by the civil defense sign? Some geek's idea of irony. I been saying we need a camera in this hall.
2 There's nothing in this hall. Someone's pulling your chain, as usual.	Unless it's a diversion. Milo's in my office. He was tailgating, so I --

1 Do you mind if I ask you a personal question?	Is it about my teeth?
2 Yes.	Damn. What exactly do you do at Virtucon?
3 I'll tell you all in due time, after we make love. But first, tell me another poem.	I think it was Wordsworth who penned this little gem: 'Press the button, pull the chain, out comes a chocolate choo-choo train.'
4 Oh, you're very clever. Let's make love, you silly, hairy little man.

1 Hello, Austin, this is Basil Exposition from British Intelligence. Thank you for confirming the link between Dr. Evil and Virtucon. Find out what part Virtucon plays in something called Project Vulcan. I'll need you and Vanessa to get on that immediately.	Right away, Exposition.
2 Where is Vanessa, by the way?

1 Hey Austin Powers, it's me, Mick Jagger.	Hey, Mick!
2 Are you more satisfied now sexually, Austin?	Well, you can't always get what you want.
3 "You can't always get what you want!" That's a great title for a song! I'm gonna write that, and it'll be a big hit.	Good on ya, man.
4 Groovy!

1 Brrrr! She must be frigid. There's two things I know about life: one, Americans will never take to soccer. Two, Swedish girls and stewardesses love to shag!  They're shag-mad, man! Let me ask you a question, Vanessa, and be honest.	Sure.
2 Do I make you horny?	What?
3 Do I make you horny? Randy, you know. To you, am I eros manifest?	I hope this is part of the unfreezing process.
4 Listen, Vanessa, I'm a swinger... That's what I do, I swing.	I understand that, Mr. Powers, but let me be perfectly clear with you, perhaps to the point of being insulting. I will never have sex with you, ever.  If you were the last man on Earth and I was the last woman on Earth, and the future of the human race depended on our having sex simply for procreation, I still would not have sex with you.

1 Hello, hello. That's Dr. Evil's cat.	How do you know?
2 I never forget a pussy... cat.

1 Austin, may I have a word with you?	Of course, luv.
2 Listen, I know I'm just being neurotic, but I can't shake this suspicious feeling about that Italian secretary, Ms. Fagina. I mean, I don't want to sound paranoid, but I've had some bad relationships in the past, and I have some jealousy issues. You went to her penthouse. It makes me feel so small to give into these insecurities, but I can't help but feel this weird, irrational, unfocused... well, jealousy. I'm sorry.	Don't be sorry. You're right to be suspicious. I shagged her. I shagged her rotten.
3 I can't believe you made love to her just like that. Did you use protection?	Of course, I had my nine-millimeter automatic.
4 No, did you use a condom?	Only sailors use condoms, man.
5 Not in the Nineties.	Well they should, filthy beggars, they go from port to port.  Alotta meant nothing to me.
6 Well, it means something to me. If you want us to have a relationship, you've got to be a one-woman man.	It was just a shag, Vanessa. You're everything to me.
7 You just don't get it, do you, Austin? Good night. Welcome to the Nineties, you're going to be very lonely.

1 It's not what it looks like, Vanessa.  At ease, boys.	Likewise.
2 I can explain. They attacked me. Gas came out of her...well, and then they... and I...	I believe you, Austin. Let's go.
3 Hold on a tick, let me put on my togs.

1 Noooooooooooooo!	Where did you learn to shoot?

1 Remember when we froze your semen, you said that if it looked like you weren't coming back to try and make you a son so that a part of you would live forever?	Yes.
2 Well, after a few years, we got sort of impatient. Dr. Evil, I want you to meet your son.	My son?
3 Yes.  Scott!

1 But Scott, who's going to take over the world when I die?	Not me.

1 Don't you think we should ask for more than a million dollars? A million dollars isn't that much money these days.	All right then...  ...FIVE MILLION DOLLARS!

1 I just think, like, he hates me. I really think he wants to kill me.	OK, Scott, no one really wants to "kill" anyone here. They say it, but they don't mean it.

1 I so agree. How did you acquire a taste for it?	Out in India. So character-forming for the British. Not the heat. Good Lord, no. The rain, dash it. A good monsoon. Fifteen inches overnight. A whole week of lovely rain. I remember one summer in Jaipur ...

1 Close. We're so hush-hush, even we know nothing about it.  Now let's see, there's coconut cake, date and walnut; I recommend the rum baba ...	Hmmm ...
2 Looks like rain, Steed...

1 Who?	Quite frankly ... it could have been you.

1 Such as?	Destruction of their local weather systems. I can zap a thousand Chernobyls into the air.
2 The result would be ...	Chaos. Transport paralysis. Crop failure.  Economic disaster. Frostbite or sunburn ... on a massive scale. You've seen a few samples...
3 Then what's stopping you?	One very small thing. A diamond 'cyclone' chip. A thousand times more information on a fraction of the size. If I possess that, my powers would be unlimited. My dear half-brother was developing it. But he suspected sabotage. He gave the chip to ... you, 'Mrs.' Peel. I want you. But also your ring.

1 You can but I wish you wouldn't ...	Thank you, Trubshaw ...

1 An invitation. To a 'formal picnic'...?	Did you say formal? I must dress.

1 Do you always drive this fast?	Have I trespassed on a male prerogative?  We're being followed. I saw him at Trubshaw's ...

1 But you did suspect me.	Not for a moment.
2 You're playing games.	Aren't we all, Mrs. Peel?
3 I thought you played by the rules.	I thought you didn't.
4 I'm playing to win.	Winning isn't everything.
5 Please don't tell me it's how you play the game.	After you -- Mrs. Peel ...

1 What is it?	Limpet bomb. Small, very compact. From Trubshaw's.
2 When all this is over, we simply must get you out of that suit.	You first.
3 Shall we?

1 Your mission is simple. Find out how and why these agents died.	I'm no spy -- where do I fit in?

1 'X' marks the spot. The shoes were delivered to ... an island in Hyde Park. Surrounded by the Serpentine. On the site of a former Ministry installation...	... and now?

1 Think she really killed those agents?	She may not know. Theory goes she may be very ill.
2 Amnesia?	Possibly. Split personality ...
3 Insane ... ?	Who knows? If Dr. Darling is right, you should watch out.
4 Why?	She may try to kill you.

1 You with Mother or Father?	Both, actually.
2 Good. Glad to see they're together at last. They don't get along. Promotion. Top job. Most unfair. Quite a fuss at the Ministry.	You don't say.  Like looking for a needle in a ...

1 What's happening?	Debbie's marrying Rick.
2 ...Really?

1 What?	You're kidding.

1 Denmark makes great Nautilus equipment.	I'd like to jerk and press those babies.

1 Shit, shit, shit, shit. My car's gone!	Maybe it had something to do.
2 Shit!

1 Some fat slob in the next booth is making a lot of noise.	Well, tell the asshole to shut up.
2 Right.  Hey, shut up. Okay, sir.	Sorry, I can't hear you. Some pin head's yelling...  Shut up, I'm talking here.  Now look, I want you to go back and I don't care what you do. Stop that marriage.

1 Well... twenty-four more hours to go and tonight we'll share with our friends and loved ones the joys of those last moments of singleness.	You better not have too much joy.
2 Wouldn't think of it. Because tomorrow...  We're going to the chapel and we're...	Gonna get married...

1 Are you okay?	Yeah.
2 This has been quite a night. Here's a thought. Why don't we go home and give our private parts a workout?	You're so romantic...

1 Congratulations on your daughter's wedding. Who's she marrying?	A real turd.
2 Well... hope she'll be very happy.

1 Let's go.	Isn't he incredible, gets along with everybody.

1 I hate her. I hate her guts, the bitch.	Larry, you and your wife got problems?
2 I don't want to talk about it. I love you guys. I love my friends.

1 Are any of those right?	This is the Park View Hotel. I'm the Hotel Manager. Are you looking for someone?
2 Yes, you. We're looking for our room... 1002.

1 Er... perhaps we ought to stop now.	No. Let's at least finish the set.

1 Excuse me, but this is as arousing as a stroll through the Vatican.	This isn't right.

1 Now, don't get into any trouble.	Take care.

1 Thanks a lot, that was the best. You're next.	Nah, not yet. Look, you're my older brother. I need some advice here. What's the deal with marriage? What can I expect?
2 Well, the first month it's great. The second month things calm down a little. By the third month you're looking through your old girlfriends' phone numbers; by the fourth month you're numb; by the fifth month, hopefully the football season starts.	Thanks, Stan, you've been a lot of help.

1 You know Knowlton pretty well?	Yeah...
2 Kind of an asshole, wasn't he?

1 You gotta let me finish --	Just come down, John. Just --
2 -- Shut up! Your dad would fucking puke if he saw how you've shit on his department!

1 There's only so much technology can do.  Thanks for the beer.	Thanks for the speakers.

1 Jesus, it's too damn bright in here... Like a goddamn spotlight... I'm goin' blind...	This?
2 Yeah... too bright...

1 I saw it.	Saw what?
2 When dad died, I saw another fire...	Everybody did.
3 I saw it before it got them. I tried to yell, but... He asked me to look out for him. And I didn't do it. I let him die.	...Jesus, you been carrying that around for twenty years? For christ's sake, you were seven years old! You think he could have heard you in there?
4 I hate him so much sometimes, Stephen. You don't know how hard it was for me to put that uniform on...	Maybe I do.  ...What a fuckin' mess, huh?  People can change Brian.
5 Sometimes right when you're looking at them.

1 Look, I'm not the same girl who had nothing better to do than wrap her legs around you on a Saturday night. This isn't about fun. I'm working here.	Carrying Swayzak's notebook?
2 Let me tell you something. Martin Swayzak is going to be this town's next mayor.	Yeah. Swayzak. Humanity's last hope. How can you work for that guy?
3 Why do you think Marty came here tonight? Because he cares about your department. You don't know how hard he works. You don't know about his programs helping West Side --	-- All I know is that his programs are getting firemen hurt.
4 Bullshit. Marty's plan is only about efficiency. I've got two cousins on the job, you think I'd work for him if I didn't believe in it?

1 This is one of the oldest fire stations in the city. Lotta tradition locked up in here. What do you think?	Homey.
2 See that trap door up there? That used to lead to the hay loft when they had horse-drawn engines. It was pretty different then... but kinda the same, y'know?	Do you miss it?  You seem like you do.
3 When I came back, I knew more than anything else that I wanted to be a fireman.	Then why did you quit?
4 I wanted to be a good one.

1 Famous story even. Straight burn. Just an engine and truck first on scene. What did you feel, Brian, when you first got there?	What?
2 You gotta tell a story too, Brian. It's fair. C'mon, don't think too hard --	I... I thought it was great. I loved it. It was nothing to these guys... medium deal.
3 Right. Light smoke, low roll. Couple'a civilians hollering -- medium deal. So young fireman Adcox and Captain McCaffrey, they head up stairs, get out on the fire escape -- McCaffrey does the ballsy jump across... what were you feeling, Brian?  C'mon, you promised. Be honest.  Okay... Guard!	-- I wanted to be him. Right then I wanted to be him more than anything...
4 Very good, Brian. -- About your report here. The way to a torch's heart is through his tools. That's how you know him. It's the way he talks to the fire. And to you if you listen.	The outlets.
5 That's a probie answer. You're smarter than that, Brian.	Trychticholorate.
6 Good. -- So our two heroes, Adcox and McCaffrey, they go back inside. Only there's another fire in there nobody sees. And it took your dad, didn't it Brian? Did you see him burn?

1 Temperature in this room was about 2000 degrees, but copper wire in outlet is melted, which requires 5000 degrees. An accidental short in the plug could of created a spark of 7000 degrees, hot enough to melt the wire and start a fire.	No it couldn't.

1 This is the copy of Swayzak's manning report that was released. Everybody on this job knows it's bullshit but we could never argue with the numbers. They're all airtight.	Yeah? Airtight?

1 Oh, man, I'm sorry.	You guys ought to try picking up a phone once in awhile.

1 So, you surviving without me?	There's no replacement 'cause of your boss' cuts, if that's what you mean. If someone else goes out on an injury we're really screwed.
2 Swayzak's not my boss.

1 Uh, Helen, I wanted to talk to you a second about Sean...	Stephen, I'm kinda busy here, can we talk about this later?

1 See that patch of shirt? We wondered about the discoloration so he ran a spectro. On a lucky shot we picked up some traces of Trychticholorate. Nobody around here had ever heard of it.	Trychticholorate? Alright, it's an absorption catalyst in toxic waste accidents. It's pretty rare, they stopped making it a couple'a years ago.
2 Probably got in Cosgrove's clothes in a gas state from the fire.	What the hell was it doing in the fire?
3 That's your job.

1 Inspector.	Alderman.

1 The Church is a fucking racket. I know how they operate. I've been part of the racket since the first time some faggot priest spilt water on my head. My Aunt Lu says I was crying all the way through. Yeah, I know their game inside out. Now I'm free of it and I'm gonna stay that way.	I'm not talking about the fucking Church. Fuck the Church. But tell me. Do you believe in God?
2 What's to believe?	That Jesus Christ was the Son of God and he came to die for your sins.

1 You took the chalice.	Yes.
2 You brought it back to the Church. And then it made it's way back to me, again.	Yes.

1 Large?	All right, cop. I want my money.
2 It's still my money. If you want to have a chance at any part of it, shithead, you will take my $120,000 and bet on tomorrow's game.	What about the money you owe me on yesterday's game?
3 Fuck yesterday's game. The World Series is seven games not six. Put in my bet.	Let me think about it.
4 There's nothing to think about. Either you put in my bet or you ain't getting nothing.

1 How's the case going?	What case?
2 The fucking rapists, man. The punks who raped that nun. The $50,000 reward from the Church! Remember?	Yeah. Sure. Yeah. We're on it bigtime. Lots of leads. You bet.
3 That 50 G could help you --

1 Same thing, y'knowwhatI'msayin', y'knowwhatI'msayin'!	We know.  We know.  Yo, check it, my black brothers, we can't let this slide.  Not this injustice. Nah, no way.  Dem' two real coons iz ill.
2 1/16, tru' 'dat.  True 'dat.

1 You don't have the demographics.	So are you telling me that you wouldn't even introduce me to Delacroix or set up a meeting?  I'm talking 'bout me, your only brother, ya own flesh and blood, hook a brother up, youknowwhatI'msayin'.
2 That'swhatI'msayin'.  I'm not blowin' my young career, brother or no brother, for you or anybody else.	There is a name, a term for your kind, the likes of you.  Back in slavery days, you would be classified as a house nigga.
3 If you think I'm a house nigga then that's your prerogative.  You got your ways to affect change, I have mine.  And I would appreciate it very much if you took ya field nigga ass out of my house.	My own sister throwin' me out.  I hope to seeya later when you get ya mind right.  Don't bother letting me out.
4 That's mighty black of you.

1 What's wrong with him?	Must be the pressure.

1 Gentlemen, the show, our show will be satirical.  You know what that is, don't you?  Trust me on this one.	We might need some mo' money behind this.
2 That can be done.

1 I would like to change your name.	To what?
2 You're now Mantan.	Mantan?  I don't even care as long as I'm dancing.  Which reminds me, I need some new kicks.

1 The material you've been creating is too white bread.  White people with black faces.  The Huxtable's, Cosby, revolutionary.  But that's dead.  We can't go down that road again.	I don't agree.  The Negro middle class does exist, and it's rich material for a dramatic series or sitcom.
2 I'm telling you it's not.

1 Protest finally forced "Amos and Andy" off the air.  Could stop us from ever getting on.	Let'em try.  I will kill to make this happen.

1 I don't give a good goddamn about Finland, Norway, Sweden or wherever ya blond ass came from.	We just punched it up a bit.  Made it funnier.
2 Funnier to who and at who's expense? Dunwitty, when Negroes start to run amok, the boycotts, when the demostrations commence, I'm giving them your home address.  Let's see how you like it when they picket your lawn in Greenwich, Connecticut.	I seriously doubt that will ever happen.  Didn't I tell you I know your people better than you do. But if by some miracle you're correct, I'm gonna invite them inside my house and we'll have a sit down, discuss it like civil human beings.

1 Dem white boys giving you a hard time?	Nuthin' I can't handle.
2 The truth is never let them seeya sweat.  You do that, that's half the battle.	Where do you go from here?
3 Three nights Charleston, South Carolina.	I didn't mean that, in life.
4 In life?  I'ma keep on living, having a good drink, got me a good young woman, make a couple of dollars and make people laugh. Haven't I always tol' you all nigga's are entertainers?  The question is what are you gonna do, Peerless?

1 Manray was under our nose the whole time.	Do you know how you will use him?
2 Not yet, but this thing will never get made.

1 Just want to say good luck.	Break a leg.

1 DeLa, you should try it sometime. Come into the light.	Light?
2 That which has been hidden in darkness is now in the light.  This bucket of blood.	You can talk all that mumbo jumbo if you want to but your hands are much bloody.  I know where I made my big mistake.  I have a general rule, never get involved romantically with somebody crazier than you.

1 Can I kiss you too?	Naw.  I'll take the zero.
2 You feel good, not nervous?	I feel fine.
3 Not nervous?  Relaxed?	Sloan, will you take your boss out of here so I can get ready.

1 Peerless, your father called.	I'll be right over.

1 Myrna is here to help us plan our strategy.	The best defense is offense.

1 Cousins, I want all of you to go to your windows.  Go to your windows and yell.  Yell, I'm tired of the drugs, the crack babies born out of wedlock to crackhead aids infested parents.  I'm tired of the inflated welfare rolls while good wholesome Americans bring less and less of their paycheck home every two weeks. I'm tired, you're tired, we're all tired of these so-called bible- thumping God fearing, whore mongling Professional athletes.  Aren't you tired of these basketball-dunking, football-running, hop-hip rapping ebonic-speaking sex offenders who got ten kids from ten different Ho's?  I know I am and so is Sleep 'N Eat.	You tellin' the truth.
2 Go to your windows and yell out, scream with all the life you can muster up inside your assaulted, bruised and battered bodies.  I'M SICK AND TIRED OF NIGGERS AND I'M NOT GONNA TAKE IT ANYMORE!

1 A lot?	Enough.

1 And, I'll tell you what, Mr. Dugan, I've been insulted grossly in this house.  I ain't at all satisfied with these here ways of going on. I'm an Englishman, I am, and a man of property; and I -- I --	If you're insulted, and not satisfied, remember there's two of us, Best.

1 The captain was the nephew and heir of the Minister of Police, Herr Galgenstein, a relationship which, no doubt, aided in the younger gentlemen's promotion.	Your loyalty to me and your service to the regiment has pleased me very well -- and now there is another occasion on which you may make yourself useful to us; if you succeed, depend on it, your reward will be your discharge from the army, and a bounty of 100 guineas.
2 What is the service, sir?	There is lately come to Berlin a gentleman in the service of the Empress Queen, who calls himself the Chevalier de Belle Fast, and wears the red riband and star of the pope's order of the Spur.  He is made for good society, polished, obliging, a libertine, without prejudices, fond of women, of good food, of high play, prudent and discreet.

1 I hope to spoil this sport, and trust to see this sword of mine in that big bully's body.	Oh, it's with pistols we fight.  You are no match for Best with the sword.
2 I'll match any man with the sword.	But swords are today impossible; Captain Best is -- is lame.  He knocked his knee against the swinging park gate last night, as he was riding home, and can scarce move it now.
3 Not against Castle Dugan gate, that has been off the hinges these ten years.	It must have been some other gate.

1 You are the young man who M. de Seebach recommended?	Yes, sir.  Here is my letter.

1 You want my heart?	It is my only object.
2 To make me wretched in two weeks.	To love you until death.  To subscribe to all your commands.
3 The amusing thing is that you deceive me without knowing, if it is true that you love me.	Deceiving someone without knowing it is something new for me.  If I do not know it, I am innocent.
4 But you deceive me nonetheless if I believe you, for it will not be in your power to love me when you love me no longer.

1 Why are you shaking?	With pleasure at finding the ribbon.

1 A meeting with the Prince of Turbingen is impossible.	The Prince left him only that choice.

1 Good night, papa.	Good night, my little darling.
2 Papa?	Yes?
3 One of the boys in the stable told Nelly that you've already bought my horse, and that it's at Doolan's farm, where Mick the groom is breaking it in.  Is that true, papa?	What the devil?  What kind of fools do we have here?  Pottle, who told the lad this story?

1 Can I at least have a drink?	It's ten thirty in the morning.
2 Yeah, if you've slept.	You know the law -- no liquor before noon. Could lose my license.
3 Don't you mean "don't need no liquor license not taken away from me"?

1 You framed-him...	None of that matters now. We got two dead bodies and a story that explains them. You're either with us, or against us -- which is it?

1 Yeah, right...	Shut up.  West's dead.

1 Hey, Ray! Just had a nice talk with your buddy Kendall -- seems you killed three people!	That son of a bitch.
2 That'd be my reaction too --	He's lying.
3 Well, why didn't you say so? We'll just drop all your charges, then --	I'm serious --

1 He -- He made me do it --	Do what?
2 Hunting -- we had to hunt him --

1 Why didn't you tell us all this in the first place?	Would you have believed me?

1 Jesus, what happened?	West... he's dead.

1 Ray, this is my life here. I ain't gonna pretend I'm not happy West is gone, but you know I couldn't have done this. It's not in me.	If not you, then who?
2 Mueller.	Oh, come on --
3 We're sweeping our area and suddenly he's gone. Couple minutes later, phosphorous grenade pops off about a third of a click away --	That's exactly what he says about you.
4 Who you gonna trust, Ray? Him or your friend?

1 That's it. You're that policeman with friends in low places. Tell me, how's Guissepe Torres doing these days? Those racketeering indictments must have really been a downer --	Levi, you got about four hours before armed men show up here, put you on a plane to Washington, and lock you in a very small dark room. I suggest you talk to us.

1 Epileptic attacks are murder on your system. Rattle your internal organs like a paint mixer.	My heart weeps.

1 You lied to us, Levi, you're going to the gas chamber unless you tell us where to find them!	I don't know --
2 Where are they!	Maybe --
3 MAYBE WHAT --	Maybe he...

1 Pike killed West, Dunbar killed Mueller, Childs, and Nunez.	Who killed Pike?
2 Someone must have got a shot off. He wasn't exactly a moving target.

1 It was so good, I actually forgot you're one of the bigger dogs now. The Base Commander. The one in control. You couldn't let him testify, could you?	What are you talking about?
2 If you let him testify then it would have all come out. West was supposed to take care of it out there, shut Nunez up and then disappear. But it got messy and people got killed. So you called your old pal Tom Hardy, figuring if worse came to worse, he'd cover for you.	You're drunk --
3 I'm not going to cover for you, Bill. Not for this.

1 I questioned him for three hours and he didn't make a sound. You don't have a badge, he won't talk to you.	Ten bucks says I have him talking in under three minutes.

1 Remember, he's the son of a Senator, so go easy. Kid gloves.	Got it.

1 I was starting to believe you, you know? That you weren't who everyone said. I guess I was wrong --	Oh, spare me the reverse psychology bullshit! This isn't my "great second chance", Osborne. Everyone thinks I'm a piece of shit cop who took money and nothing is going to change that. Nobody will ever know what happens here --
2 But you will.

1 So what now?	Now I go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.
2 Think it'll work?	Nah.

1 This isn't the time --	This is the perfect time. You know what makes a good detective? The number of confessions they get. You're a good detective, Osborne. So now you get mine.
2 What if I don't want it?	Tough.

1 Pike, please --	Although that won't matter much when coupled with the murder charge --

1 Pike never confessed.	We've been making progress, I see.

1 I told him what had really happened to West. Told him to keep quiet about it or I'd destroy him. Because if it came out that I was involved with the whole PX scam, my father would be finished.	I scared Dunbar into silence. He's been trying to cover for me the whole time. We got here, you came to see me... I didn't know if I could trust him with that kind of secret --
2 So you framed him. The same way Childs was going to frame Pike.

1 Tell him to shut up --	-- failure to comply with this arrest is a court martialable offense in and of itself --

1 What happens to Dunbar now?	Gets on his plane in ten minutes, which means you two are done. You'll understand if I don't walk you out.

1 Didn't kill anything, did I?	A few rabbits, but I think one of them was already dead.
2 That would explain the indigestion.

1 Or are you too scared?	I'll go in right now and get that eye.
2 Then do it.	Fine, I will.
3 Fine, you do it.	Fine, I'm doing it.

1 How old are you?	Eighteen.
2 I'm eight. That means when I'm eighteen, you'll be 28. And when I'm 28, you'll only be 38.	You're pretty good at arithmetic.
3 And when I'm 38, you'll be 48. And that's not much difference at all.

1 Lord, I'm sorry I...	Please. Go. Just go.
2 I'll...	Go.

1 Is it the medicine that's making you thirsty?	Truth is, I've been thirsty my whole life. Never really known why.

1 The one about the witch.	Your mom says I can't tell you that one anymore. You get nightmares.
2 I'm not scared.

1 Did I ever tell you about how...	Yes.

1 Where are we headed?	You say...
2 The River!

1 I've been working on this poem for 12 years.	Really.
2 There's a lot of expectation. I don't want to disappoint my fans.

1 Can I ask you a question? Why did you come here today? If you found this deed, why didn't you just ask Eddie?	Because he's dying.

1 I'm going with you.	You don't have to.
2 I'm going with you.

1 How is he?	He's impossible. He won't eat. And because he won't eat, he gets weaker. And because he's weaker, he doesn't want to eat.
2 How much time does he have left?	You don't talk about those things. Not yet.

1 Mom?	Yes?

1 What's this?	It's nothing. I burnt myself.
2 That's not a burn.	It is. I did it cooking.

1 Sorry. You've lost me...	I'm asking what you're here for.
2 What?

1 She says she has a secret to tell.	What?

1 He wants a lot of money.	I'll give him money. Tell him to put the...
2 He wants the money from your bank.	I'll fuckin' give it to him! We'll go down there.
3 You don't understand. He wants all the money that is in your bank.	I've got eight hundred pounds. Oh Jesus.

1 I don't understand.	Happy bath day.

1 Give me some money.	I don't have any money.

1 Excuse me?	Get out
2 You are throwing me out.	Get out.

1 You know you can come under the blanket.	It's alright.

1 My name's Sophia.	Sophia. Hello Sophia. Mine's still John.

1 This was very sweet of you.	Well. Hope you enjoy it.

1 And, sir... do you have a size in mind for what you're lookin' for?	That young lady's size, right'cher.
2 Well, that makes it easier.

1 YOU HAD A PLAN! YOU HAD A GODDAMN LIFE! AND SHE JUST FUCKED THE GUTS OUT OF YOU!	It's not her fault, Gill. She's had to take care of me all this time, cuz I'd just start throwin' up... choking. Just losin' my grip. And she listened. She listened to me.  And... I got better. I don't get nervous like I used to. And since we been together... she been faithful to me. Put all that junk behind her...
2 The only thing that cunt's had behind her is me and half the town fuckin' her.  Your first night away, I come over and drop off the spare keys like you wanted me to. You weren't gone two hours and she was aching to get me inside her. Like she was havin' some kind'a fit.

1 Better?	Yeah.

1 Don't... don't say that to me...	Son, I'm grown. Don't got patience to suffer you children and this monkey junk. I'm too old to play house...  ...and cowboys. So let's have it. End me or get out of my face!

1 Gal, you ain't right yet.	I'm right enough to stand on my own two feet. Now take this Goddamn chain off...
2 How you let men treat ya like they do?	What?
3 These men you up under. How you let them do ya like that?	Do me? Do me like this, you mean? Like chainin' me up?
4 You know what I'm talkin' about.  All that mess with ya teachers and... boys in the backs of trucks.	The hell you know about me?! You got no right to talk to me about that shit! The hell you think you are?
5 I've saved ya life, gal. I can do and say whatever the fuck I want.

1 Cuz once in a while soil need a change. Corn take up a lot of nitrate in the fertilizer. So next crop what ya do is plant ya some soy beans. That give off a lot of nitrate. Change keeps it all growin' and growin' strong.  Sting a bit?	Itches.
2 Means ya healin'.  So all this farmin' make me think on Matthew. Matthew 13. The parable of the sower? Man toss seed on rock, on the wayside, some fell in thorns... you know the story?	Uh-uh.

1 My life is gone. Only life I was livin'. And I lost it.	I'm here with you.
2 I had love in my heart. And I gave it to one woman. And she gone now.  Where am I gonna put all this love?

1 Sorry.	Looks like you know a song.
2 Don't know where I learn't it, but... it's there in my head.

1 How a girl get like that?	Like I told you.

1 Good. Makin' steaks for supper. I expect you to come.	You mean with you and that woman chained to ya radiator?
2 You treat folks special when they company. It's just supper, R.L., shit.	One thing at a time, Laz.

1 Keep the change on that.	Naw... I got it, Mr. Lazarus.  You wanna tip me, best do it in butter beans. Momma say she need a bag 'a yours, none of that store-bought junk. That's what she said.

1 I think it'd be better if you talk to me.	Yeah?
2 Just about anything, you know. It can be funny or... not. Just tell me somethin'.

1 You got any money?	Thought you had a man for that.
2 I said we wasn't gonna talk about him.	What we just did, you askin' for money, make a man stop. I ain't callin' you no ho. But I ain't gonna be played like no trick, neither. Remember... you called me.
3 Save that hustle talk to them field ballers you sell crack to.	What'd I tell you?  I don't do none of that shit no more. I'm in communications now.
4 Stolen phone cards and two-ways is what you sayin'.

1 ... I found the goombah... Cavello. He's --	-- I should tear your head off.
2 Whoa, I knew you were going to say that.  I absolutely anticipated that, Nick.  But I said to myself, Charlie, Charlie, we can move up on this, so go find Nicklaus... He'll be pissed for a moment, but then it'll dawn on him --	-- Hey, I got a better chance of being hit by a bus then moving up.

1 Nick, have I been a good partner?	Number five with a bullet.

1 ... He's a sorry old guy, but I like him.	He couldn't find his ass with both hands.

1 Where're you going, Ichiro?	The mayor's office, under the bed, the back room at Lombardi's.  And call me Ich.

1 Know her?	We can ask someone I used to work with.  A criminal.  Someone I pay money to...
2 A snitch?

1 Yakuza.	Good.  Very good...

1 What's in the box?	For Sugai.  Caviar, French cheese, ham... If you come to apologize for interrupting his meeting, Sugai may feel obligated to see you.
2 So I bring some cheese?

1 You know, Nick, we can't lose.	Why's that?
2 Because we're the biggest things to hit this town since Godzilla.

1 Don't be an ass.	He's on duty.
2 I paid for that.

1 I still think you're a bastard.	What if I chant?
2 Wouldn't help.  Watch out for Ich.

1 You and Charlie are taking the Jap home, tonight.	What...?  What if I say no?
2 Check your gun before you leave. They're not allowed in Japan.  It's a nice, safe country.	Why me?
3 They said send a detective if I could spare one.  I can always spare you.

1 Your plane leaves at six.  Two officers will escort you.	For God's sake, Ohashi, I need your help.  Let me out of here!
2 You had my help, detective.	If anything happens to her while I'm here --
3 -- Do you know where she is, detective?  Do you know how to find her?  Even where to start?  We will find them.	I have to get to Sugai.
4 Goodbye, officer.

1 We're not used to the big city. Where we come from it's not so easy to get lost.	You certainly have a nice place here.
2 Well stocked.

1 The facts of life.  I'll be blunt. To make an alteration in the evolvement of an organic life system, at least by men, makers or not, it fatal.  A coding sequence can't be revised once it's established.	Why?
2 Because by the second day of incubation any cells that have undergone reversion mutation give rise to revertant colonies -- like rats leaving a sinking ship.  The ship sinks.	What about E.M.S. recombination?
3 We've already tried it -- ethyl methane sulfonate is an alkylating agent and a potent mutagen -- it creates a virus so lethal the subject was destroyed before we left the table.

1 We have a lot in common.	You mean that you can't come here and I can't go there?
2 Not only that, but we have smiliar problems.  Accelerated decrepitude. But we don't want to die quite yet.	Of course not.
3 You could help us.	I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy.  I wish I did, but you're out of my league.
4 If we don't find help soon, Pris hasn't got long to live.

1 Six, huh?	Five.  Three nights ago one of them managed to break into the Tyrell Corporation.  Killed two guards and got as far as the Genetic Sector before he got fried going through an electro- field.
2 What was he after?	There wasn't much left of him, so we can't be sure.  But bio- chemical data and morphology records of the Nexus-6 were reported missing.  Going on the possibility they might try to infiltrate we send Holden in to run Voight-Kampff tests on the new employees.  Guess he found himself one.

1 It's gotta be right for my customer.	Your customer, eh?

1 You want to see my friends?	Sorry, don't have the time.
2 No problem.

1 What's that?	I'm taking a piss.

1 This one looks familiar, but I don't know.  Naw.  There's one came in today looks a little like this one but...	What did she want?
2 Who?	The girl that doesn't look like that girl.
3 Nothing.  She wanted to know about suck night.	What night?
4 I didn't know if I wanted to handle her -- I already got a snake act.  But my partner goes down there to the Opera House on suck night to book the good ones.	What's suck night?
5 That's what we call in the trade, audition free-for- alls and most of it sucks. Bit I don't think that's her.	You talking about the Opera House on the Main?

1 It seems your department doesn't believe out new unit is to the public benefit.	A humanoid robot is like any other machine, it can be a benefit or a hazard.  If it's a benefit, it's not our problem.
2 But because your department can't do an adequate job in detecting the miniscule number at large, it's a problem.  Correct, Mr. Deckard?

1 You use your equipment, don't you?	So?
2 So, I'm a piece of equipment. Use me.

1 Do you dream?	Yeah.  Sometimes.
2 I wish I could.

1 Don't leave here.  Don't open the door, don't answer the phone.	What difference will it make?
2 Just wait here.

1 How many questions does it usually take, Mr. Deckard?	Five, maybe six.

1 How come you were in my truck?	I was tired and didn't have any place to go.

1 Methuselah Syndrome.	What's that?
2 My glands.  They grow old too fast.	Is that why you're still here?
3 Yes.  I couldn't pass the test.

1 We want you to come with us so we can talk some more about your experiences.	Come where?
2 My office.	For how long?
3 Well, that depends...	I thank you very much for the invitation, but I'm quite busy today. Perhaps I could see you tomorrow.

1 Get out of here!	No, you get out of here.

1 So for four thousand dollars, all I have to do is drive you to your hotel?	Yes.
2 And that's it?	Yes.
3 I don't have to take a physical in your space ship?	Heck, no!  What?!
4 Okay.  What the hell?  You got a deal. Get in.

1 I knew this would happen!  You're like a lost puppy!	Can't you please just talk to me for one second?
2 Okay!  Damn!

1 We'll have to rent a refrigerated truck for the beef and poultry.	It's your life.  And, by the way, it's a dandy.
2 I guess we'll need another locker.	No problem.  We'll just sell another baseball card.
3 You know, Eve -- don't get mad, okay? - -  but, I'd just be lost without you.

1 Here you go.  One champagne cocktail.	Thank-Q!
2 I thought only hookers drank those things.	Well, I know Mom sure likes 'em!

1 Hey, Eve!	Have you ever heard the saying, "He hasn't got enough sense to come in out of the rain?"
2 Yep.  You know, my father -- who is a scientist -- says that everything is a miracle. Everything. Until recently I wasn 't sure what he meant by that.	Yeah? No kidding. Listen, you still want to go girl hunting tonight?
3 I certainly do!	Okay. But you know, this business of finding you a wife -- it's kind of ridiculous, don't you think?
4 No it's not!	Yes it is. A girlfriend maybe. But a wife? I mean...
5 Then just help me find a girlfriend! That's all I ask. I'll give you every single card I've got left!	Hey, screw you! Okay? You think I'm just somebody you can buy off! Listen, let me tell you something--
6 Would you do it just because you're my friend? My very best friend.	Well...yeah. Okay.

1 Yeah.  Could be.  Go say hello, Romeo. Looks like a healthy non-mutant to me.	Okay. All right.  And what do I say?
2 Say something surprising. And funny. Lie, if need be.

1 Adam...dumb question, but humor me. Have you ever had sex before?	No.

1 I've got almost everything we need! And this nice man...	Archbishop Melker. We met earlier.

1 Adam...don't forget...don't forget ...	Yes, father?! Yes?
2 ...the pipe tobacco.	Yes, sir.  Is that all?

1 Well, we try. Listen, let me just ask you a few questions.  When did Alaska become a state?	1959.
2 Who use to own it?	Russia.
3 When did we get it from them?	1867.  Seward's Folly. We paid 7.2 million dollars for it. A tidy sum then, as well as now. I'm quoting my father, of course.
4 What's the capitol?	Juneau.
5 Hello! It's Anchorage!  Gotcha!	Sorry, that's the largest city.

1 Okay, Troy!  Let's get those all-beef frozen patties!	How 'bout we check with Eve first?
2 You bet!	So, did you buy a movie?
3 What?	A magazine?  A toy perhaps?  In the bookstore.
4 No, I wouldn't go in one of those places with a gas mask on.	I know what you mean!  I usually wear a big hat and dark glasses.
5 Does that work?	Yeah...Seems to.

1 Hello.	Hi.

1 I don't know how far you'll have to travel to find supplies, but if you can't get home by nightfall, I want you to look for something called a Holiday Inn. Write that down. It's a hotel. There might still be one standing.	Yes, ma'am.

1 According to Caltech, this Webber guy was a bonafide genius and a borderline nutcase.	Well, he and Mrs. Nutcase must have been out here when the plane hit.
2 Unless we get a postcard or somethin', that's my guess.	What about relatives?
3 All back East.	The neighbors over there said the guy spent day and night out here. She'd bring him sandwiches and hot Dr. Pepper.
4 He drank it hot?	Yeah.
5 Good god.	Yeah.

1 Home sweet home!	To you maybe.

1 Calvin?!	Right here!
2 We looked all over for you. What are you doing back here?	Oh, I was just examining this rear hatchway.
3 Why?	No reason.  Well, it's pretty clear that the front entrance caved in when the bomb went off. So, you know, when the time is up, we'll have to return to the surface using, you know, this back entrance.  Which is very nice because it has the service elevator!
4 Very nice. Unless it caved in, too.	Yes.  Well... yes.

1 Let's eat our cake.	Yeah. Let's dig in!

1 And Lord we ask finally that you send an angel to look after and protect our beloved son, Adam.  Amen.	Amen.

1 So, Adam...where on earth are you from?	Out-of-town.  That's all he'll say.

1 Just be yourself.	Always good advice.
2 For him. It doesn't work for the rest of us.

1 I don't think so.	Coward!

1 I'm going to need two more banana- splits and a cherry coke!	You bet, Mom! Coming up!

1 Doctor Gynde, my whole family's sick. What's going on?	I'm not sick.

1 By the way, Jeffrey, this story isn't going to the press and I'm going to ask you to consider all you've heard strictly confidential. Do not discuss this business with anyone, but me, or other police personnel. Got it?	Got it. Thanks for letting me in on as much as you did.
2 Come on. I'll drive you home. It's on my way.

1 For now. Alright, you better be. And Sandy better not be involved with this, I can tell you. Be prepared to come in for further interrogation on this later.	Yes sir.

1 Don't.  I don't like that. What do you want?	Nothing. Are you alright?
2 Sure I'm alright. 	I'll go then.

1 Why are you here. Whatiya want?	I, uh.
2 I looked for you in my closet tonight.  It's crazy, I don't know where you came from, but I like you.	That's not crazy. I like you too.

1 What do you want to do?	I'm doing it.
2 Are you a bad boy?	Whatiya mean?
3 Do you want to do bad things?  Anything, anything.	What do you want?
4 I want you to hurt me.	No. I told you. I don't want to hurt you. I want to help you. I think I know some of what is happening to you.  Dorothy? Frank has your husband and son. Dorothy? Doesn't he? You have to do something Dorothy. Go to the police.
5 No police!!!  No police!!

1 Oh no.	No.  Hi baby.

1 Look at these. What are these?	Come on, Frank. Let's go. Please.

1 Don't be a good neighbor to her or I'm gonna send you a love letter. Straight from my heart, fucker. You know what a love letter is? It's a bullet, straight from my gun, fucker. Once you get a love letter from me, you're fucked forever. Understand, Fuck?	Yes.
2 I'll send you straight to hell, Fuck!

1 Hello, uh, my name is Jeffrey Beaumont. Is Detective Williams in?	Oh, yes, Jeffrey. Come in. He'll be back any minute now. You're welcome to wait. Is it urgent?
2 I just wanted to ask him a few questions, that's all. Maybe I better go.	Really, he'll be home soon, would you like a cup of coffee?
3 Alright.

1 Hi Dad.	Hey Jeff.

1 I guess I'll see you sometime.	I guess so. Like you said. It's a strange world.
2 Yeah. Good bye.

1 I'll tell Mike I'm sick. There's a game tonight anyway and he'll never miss me. Afterwards he can go out with the guys. Just so the record is kept straight though, I love Mike. What do want me to do?	First of all, we'll have a nice dinner. Try to find out where Dorothy sings.
2 I already know. The "Slow Club". It's on Route 7.	Great. I'll pick you up around eight o'clock. Is that good?
3 Yeah, but don't pick me up. My father may think it's strange. I'll walk over to your house. I'll be there at eight o'clock.	Okay. You better get out before someone sees us.

1 No, silly - I'm still in school you know. But I'll meet you after school and you can tell me what you've learned. You better be careful, Jeffrey.	I will. I'll pick you up on the same corner at three thirty-five, okay?

1 What was that all about?	Nothing, really! It's good to see you.
2 It's good to see you.	Where to?
3 Just go over to Gelford and up to Vista. It's not far. Can you tell me any more about what you learned?	I'd rather not talk about it. I'll tell you about it sometime.
4 It's okay.	You look beautiful.
5 Thank you. Whatiya say we just enjoy the evening?	I like that idea, that's a real good idea.

1 Look Jeffrey.	Yeah. I just saw him outside. Maybe the robins are here.

1 There's ways around that.	Go find one.

1 Poppa Joe said there was only two. In and out.  Boy, you guys sure did a good job. You're good, huh? Cool masks. Where'd you get them?	Let's do him right here.

1 Yeah, well...	Oh, what the fuck? How do you guys decide who you're... I mean, who makes the cut? Is there a raffle or something?

1 You little fuck. Let him go. I'll drop you right here.	Okay, just calm down. He could hurt us, brother. He could ruin the whole thing.
2 Let him go or I will deliver you, right now. 	You won't do it Connor, you won't. You love me man.

1 Yeah, we promise.	Well, there's my boys.  Shit. I gotta go. Looks like I caused a ruckus with that shot. Half the damn neighborhood is comin'.

1 I do believe the Monsignor finally got a point.	Aye.

1 How do you think he figured all this out without talking to us?	Italian.

1 That was way easier than I thought.	Aye.
2 On TV ya always get that asshole that jumps behind the couch.	Yeah, and ya gotta shoot at him for ten minutes.
3 Oh, we're good man.	Yes, we are.

1 He isn't to be touched.	He's a good man.

1 Only two did the shooting.  So what are you thinking, Russian retaliation?	Nah, too quick half their infrastructure got taken out at the Copley plaza. Besides, if you're a hitter, you're either working for the Russians or the Italians. There's no riding the fence. Our little theory from last night just got blown to shit. Something... new is going on here.

1 Now stay with me, boys. What did they do to make two such identical wounds? Did one guy put him on his knees, pop a cap in, sit him back up and shoot him again the same way? No. Two men of similar height dropped this guy down, each put some iron to his head and boom! That's all she fuckin' wrote!	What about one guy with two guns?
2 Possible, but unlikely. The angles are too extreme. A guy holding two guns to the back of your head is gonna shoot straight ahead. He wouldn't cock out his elbows, makes no sense. Besides, you telling me one guy came in here and killed eight men with eight extremely well aimed shots in just a few seconds? No way. Had to be at least two.

1 Uh.  Shit, I, uh...	It tells us that he was the last to die. All these men  Were carrying. They came in, dropped all in seconds and then took their time with fag man. Didn't they, Duffy?!  They sure as fuck did!

1 Right now.	Don't kill me. Oh shit, please no. I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man!... the funny man... the funny.

1 Liberating isn't it?	Y'know it is, a bit.

1 Hello? You there?	Y-Yes my son.

1 I wouldn't have, uh, killed you, Father.  Dominus Ominus. Remember, you're bound. You can't talk about this... to anyone.	Just go!

1 Now that window can never be locked. It's impossible.	See, your mind is very good with the more mechanical details. Whereas my strength would be --

1 Is it back in?	Yeah.

1 What about what that guy said?	Oh, shit. That was scary. In the middle of the robbery. The manager looks at me. Right in the eye. And goes, I'm going to remember you.

1 Dignan, I can't get my hair cut. That's just not possible, all right?	Then you're going to have to dye it, Anthony. We've got to hide our identities. Especially after Bob crashed the car.

1 See, one day we were playing hot box over at my next door neighbor Mr. Langston's house and Anthony fell in the pool and got knocked unconscious. I had to dive in and save him.	This was in fourth grade.
2 Mr. Langston performed cardiopulmonary recitation. CPR. I've never said this before, but frankly I thought Anthony was dead. The veins in his face were all sticking out. His skin was blue. He truly did look dead.	After that my parents never let me go to Dignan's again.
3 They blamed my family for everything. They always said Mr. Langston saved Anthony's life.

1 I wish I'd been there.	Would of been nice.

1 Applejack would of got him anyway. This was just the quicker way.	You really hit a guy with a bottle?

1 Shit, Dignan.	What the fuck are we doing out here?
2 I don't know, Dignan. You went crazy.	I'm sorry, Bob.

1 I'm in position, Scarecrow.	Any activity?
2 Not at all. The place is totally deserted.	Good. It's supposed to be.
3 I've got a great view up here. I can see all the --	Stand by, Bird Dog.

1 Come on.	I'll see you there.
2 What?	I'll see you there.
3 What are you talking about?	I'll get him.
4 There's not enough time.	Yes, there is. Let's get organized.

1 So how is it in there? 	What can I say? It's jail. You don't sleep when you want to. You don't eat when you want to.

1 I'd like to live in that place. Hinckley Cold Storage.	Yeah. Convert it into lofts. OK. Pop quiz. What's the single most important aspect of your job?

1 I'll tell you, Anthony. Times like this I get philosophical. What does it mean? What's it all about? Are you afraid to die?	Me?
2 No, that door over there.	I don't want to die.
3 Are you afraid?	Yeah. I mean, I don't think about it all the time. But once in awhile I kind of go, Woah. Man.
4 Exactly. Woah.	Death.
5 The fear of death, The pain of consciousness.  Did you mix this martini?	No. Bob did.
6 Bob. Bob. That's a palindrome.  I love palindromes.	Are you afraid to die, Mr. Henry?
7 Anthony, I'm petrified.

1 Are you serious?	Yeah. He said that.

1 What?	Is that OK?

1 You OK, Bob?	No, I'm having a heart attack. Of course, I'm OK. What's that supposed to mean?
2 Nothing. I was just asking.

1 Does my skin feel soft, Anthony?	God, yes. Like silk.

1 Wait. Did he see us?	We're going too slow. It looks like we're following him.

1 You stole a Trans-Am.	Yes. I did.
2 OK, Bob.	It's true, Dignan.
3 Well. What do you want to do? You want to steal one or just drive your car?	I'll just drive my car.

1 I paid for it.	God DAMMIT.

1 Way to go, Bob!	I told you they were there.
2 So it's my fault?

1 What do you mean get back?	Well, obviously, we got to go back.
2 Bob, that makes no sense.	Dignan, he's my brother. I can't just leave him there.
3 This could be a trap.	Come on, Dignan.
4 Don't "Come on, Dignan" me.	I'm going back.
5 Not in that car you're not.	Watch me.
6 Good luck, since I got the keys.

1 Come on!	I don't want to fight you, Dignan.

1 Jesus Christ. What the fuck is that?	I didn't think there was an alarm.
2 Take him to the car, Bob.

1 How you doing, Bob?	Hey, Jackson. How's it going?

1 Join the party, fellas.	We're just going over a few things.

1 Guess I'll get another Tecate.	Si. Tecate. You like to fight?
2 What?	Fight. You know.

1 Treadstone.	Never heard of it.
2 That's not gonna fly.	With all due respect, Pam, I think you might've wandered a little past your pay-grade.

1 Sit down.	I'd rather stand if it's all the same to you.
2 I don't exactly know what to say -- I'm sorry.	'Why' would be enough for me.
3 I'm not a traitor. I've served my ountry.	And pocketed a fair amount of change while doing it.
4 Why not? It was just money.	And Danny Zorn, what was that?
5 Had to be done.	No good options left?
6 In the end, honestly, it's hubris. Simple hubris. You reach a point in this game when the only satisfaction left is to see how clever you are.	No. You lost your way.
7 Well, you're probably right. I guess that's all that hubris is.

1 It was my job. My first time. Your father was supposed to be alone. But then your mother, she came out of nowhere...  I had to change my plan.  You understand me?  You don't have to live like that anymore. Thinking that.	You killed them.

1 Try again.	Shot dead in Paris. Dead the night you walked out.

1 But you're sure?	He was at the campground yesterday.
2 So...	It's wrong. Guy with a rental car and hundred dollar sneakers sleeps in a tent?

1 See that tram coming around the corner?	Yes.
2 Get on it.

1 What do you want?	I want to come in.

1 Looks like he's been detained.	Who's going? Us?
2 There's only a Consulate, they sent a field officer out half an hour ago --	Then get a number, they need to know who they're dealing with.

1 I'm here. So is Donnie and Jack Weller. We understand you're using the full allocation for this buy?	That's where we came out.
2 It's a lot of money, Pam.	We're talking raw, unprocessed KGB files. It's not something we can go out and comparison shop.
3 Still...	For a thief. A mole. I vetted the source, Marty. He's real. If it does nothing more than narrow the list of suspects, it's a bargain at ten times the price.

1 What do you think? Is he coming in?	I don't know. He was sick. He wanted out. I believed him.
2 Alright...

1 What are they doing?	Saying goodbye in their own way -- in outlawed tartans, with outlawed pipes, playing outlawed tunes.

1 He won't come.	He will. I know he will.

1 No, M'lord.	Look at me. I said LOOK AT ME!

1 Stephen ready?	Aye.

1 You'll move	I will not.

1 I have faced him. Have you?	Let her speak.
2 He will fight you forever. But what does he fight for? Freedom first, and peace. So grant them.

1 Knowing his passion for his lost love, they next plotted to take him by desecrating the graves of his father and brother and setting an ambush at the grave of his wife. He fought his way through the trap and carried her body to a secret place! Now that is romance, Oui?	...I wouldn't know.

1 M'lady... what kindness of you to visit a stranger.	Sir, I... come to beg you to confess all, and swear allegiance to the king, that he might show you mercy.
2 Will he show mercy to my country? Will he take back his soldiers, and let us rule ourselves?	Mercy... is to die quickly. Perhaps even live in the Tower. In time, who knows what can happen, if you can only live.
3 If I swear to him, then everything I am is dead already.

1 Mrs. Treborn! I need to speak with you!	I'm sorry, but can it wait til tonight? I'm already late for work --

1 Righty-tighty, lefty-lucy.	Thanks. Don't worry Evan, you'll have plenty of time.

1 Why do you ask?	No, it's just weird with him being such a brain and all, I just wondered if he was ever able to remember stuff he'd forgotten.
2 When he was around your age... almost exactly your age. He said he figured out a trick to remember the past.

1 Best not bitch up. Wind up someone's luggage that way.	Can you protect me?
2 Jesus himself couldn't make me take on the Brotherhood. When they come, just put your mind in another place, man. Be somewhere else.

1 It's a little complicated. I haven't seen results exactly like these before.	Are you sure? Not even with my father?

1 Whasamatter? Lost your Rolex?	Huh?
2 Fuck off, frat boy.

1 Welcome home. Thought you might like some fresh air for a change.	Hi, Lenny.

1 What do you think it is about us that makes us so perfect? Like, looking back, whatever gave you the nerve to sneak out and visit me after I moved away?	As if my dad could've stopped me from seeing you. What's he gonna do to me?

1 So how's tricks? Sorry, occupational humor.	I get it. You can drop it now.
2 Oh, I'm sorry. Does my line of work make you uncomfortable, precious?	No. Just that you need to hurt me with it. I've been where you've been.
3 Ha! Where's that?	The bottom. When you're just a piece of meat waiting for the next attack.

1 We're really gonna be in a movie!?	That's right, Evan, and you get to be the star.

1 I was praying this curse would have ended with me.	But it didn't. And now I need info to make things right again and you're the only one who can give it to me.
2 There is no "right". When you change who people are, you destroy who they were.	Who's to say you can't make things better?

1 Most guys tuck their porn under here, but all you have are... comp books.	Yeah. I've been keeping journals since I was seven.
2 Wow... read something.

1 What do you need it for? I don't get you lately.	Duly noted. Now I'm gonna ask you for one last favor.
2 What?	Shhh. I need to concentrate on the blockbuster if I'm gonna destroy it.
3 Destroy it?	If I hadn't blown my arms off, Mom never woulda started smoking in the first place. Now shhhh.

1 Mom. Don't cry. I can change this.	I think I'll go check out the chapel.

1 Monsieur Rick?	Yes?
2 Could I speak to you for just a moment, please?

1 Such a bargain. But that is your decision?	I'm sorry. It is.

1 Excuse me, Monsieur Rick, but a gentleman inside has won twenty thousand francs. The cashier would like some money.	Well, I'll get it from the safe.
2 I am so upset, Monsieur Rick. You know I can't understand --	-- Forget it, Emil. Mistakes like that happen all the time.
3 I'm awfully sorry.

1 Ah, to get out of Casablanca and go to America! You're a lucky man.	Oh, by the way, my agreement with Sam's always been that he gets twenty- five percent of the profits. That still goes.
2 Hmmm. I happen to know that he gets ten percent. But he's worth twenty- five.	And Abdul and Carl and Sacha, they stay with the place, or I don't sell.
3 Of course they stay. Rick's wouldn't be Rick's without them.	Well, so long.

1 Mademoiselle, after this disturbance it is not safe for Laszlo to stay in Casablanca.	This morning you implied it was not safe for him to leave Casablanca.
2 That is also true, except for one destination, to return to occupied France.	Occupied France?
3 Uh huh. Under a safe conduct from me.	What value is that? You may recall what German guarantees have been worth in the past.
4 There are only two other alternatives for him.	What are they?
5 It is possible the French authorities will find a reason to put him in the concentration camp here.	And the other alternative?
6 My dear Mademoiselle, perhaps you have already observed that in Casablanca, human life is cheap. Good night, Mademoiselle.

1 But be serious, darling. You are in danger and you must leave Paris.	No, no, no, no. We must leave.
2 Yes, of course, we --	-- The train for Marseilles leaves at five o'clock. I'll pick you up at your hotel at four-thirty.
3 No, no. Not at my hotel. I, uh, I have things to do in the city before I leave. I'll meet you at the station, huh?	All right. At a quarter to five.  Say, why don't we get married in Marseilles?

1 I told you this morning you'd come around, but this is a little ahead of schedule. Well, won't you sit down?	Richard, I had to see you.
2 You use "Richard" again? We're back in Paris.	Please.
3 Your unexpected visit isn't connected by any chance with the letters of transit? It seems that as long as I have those letters I'll never be lonely.	You can ask any price you want, but you must give me those letters.
4 I went through all that with your husband. It's no deal.	I know how you feel about me, but I'm asking you to put your feelings aside for something more important.
5 Do I have to hear again what a great man your husband is? What an important cause he's fighting for?	It was your cause, too. In your own way, you were fighting for the same thing.
6 I'm not fighting for anything anymore, except myself. I'm the only cause I'm interested in.

1 I'm saying it because it's true. Inside of us we both know you belong with Victor. You're part of his work, the thing that keeps him going. If that plane leaves the ground and you're not with him, you'll regret it.	No.
2 Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon, and for the rest of your life.	But what about us?
3 We'll always have Paris. We didn't have, we'd lost it, until you came to Casablanca. We got it back last night.	And I said I would never leave you.
4 And you never will. But I've got a job to do, too. Where I'm going you can't follow. What I've got to do you can't be any part of. Ilsa, I'm no good at being noble, but it doesn't take much to see that the problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world. Someday you'll understand that. Now, now...

1 Goodnight.	Goodnight.

1 Did he give any reason?	He suggested I ask you.
2 Ask me?	Yes. He said, "Ask your wife." I don't know why he said that.

1 I'm afraid Major Strasser would insist.	You're saying this only to make me go.

1 Well, this might come in handy.	Thank you.
2 Had a close one, eh?	Yes, rather.

1 Let us say that it is my request. That is a much more pleasant word.	Very well.

1 I'm sure you'll excuse me if I am not gracious, but you see, Major Strasser, I'm a Czechoslovakian.	You were a Czechoslovakian. Now you are a subject of the German Reich!

1 Good evening, gentlemen.	Good evening, Captain.

1 I strongly suspect that Ugarte left the letters of transit with Mr. Blaine. I would suggest you search the cafe immediately and thoroughly.	If Rick has the letters, he's much too smart to let you find them there.
2 You give him credit for too much cleverness. My impression was that he's just another blundering American.	But we mustn't underestimate American blundering. I was with them when they "blundered" into Berlin in 1918.

1 The plane to Lisbon.  You would like to be on it?	Why? What's in Lisbon?
2 The clipper to America.

1 Yeah, you were saying?	Excuse me.

1 How can you close me up? On what grounds?	I am shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on in here!

1 If you don't mind, you fill in the names. That will make it even more official.	You think of everything, don't you?
2 And the names are Mr. and Mrs. Victor Laszlo.

1 I understand you came here from Paris at the time of the occupation.	There seems to be no secret about that.
2 Are you one of those people who cannot imagine the Germans in their beloved Paris?	It's not particularly my beloved Paris.

1 One moment. Tonight I'll be selling those for more money than even I have ever dreamed of, and then, addio Casablanca! You know, Rick, I have many friends in Casablanca, but somehow, just because you despise me you're the only one I trust. Will you keep these for me? Please.	For how long?
2 Perhaps an hour, perhaps a little longer.	I don't want them here overnight.
3 Don't be afraid of that. Please keep them for me. Thank you. I knew I could trust you.

1 It took this test package thirty-two hours to get from Seattle to St. Petersburg, a distance of nine thousand miles.  And then it took forty-one hours to get from our warehouse in St. Petersburg to here, a distance of, what --	Six kilometers.  Four miles.
2 So how are we going to get this place shaped up?

1 You're putting off the inevitable.	I'm putting it off.

1 I float.  You sink.  End of story.	I'm serious.  I'm always going on about me, me, me.  Enough about me.  Your turn.
2 It's a fucking soccer ball, you idiot.	Shut up.

1 Our apologies that it never made it to the recipient.	He was a sorry sonofabitch, and I'm sorry I ever married him.

1 How was Russia?	Cold.
2 Don't overwhelm me with details, you know how I hate that.  Did you get it fixed?	I thought I did.

1 This isn't working out.	We're a little emotional here.  It's Christmas, maybe we're over-reacting.
2 "We're" not over-reacting.	Could you watch Jango?
3 No.	I can't take him to work.

1 Her name's Hannah.	Is that Jango?
2 No, this is Jack.  Jango was hit by a UPS truck.  Can you believe it?

1 I've got to get back to Memphis. Hannah's babysitter has finals.	It means a lot...that you came.
2 I had to come.  To be sure you were okay.

1 Need some help?	You bet I do.  High tide comes right up to this road.

1 Look, I help take care of the place.  You got my check, didn't you Mom?	That new roof, that's your doing.

1 Kamal is not here.	Who is this?  Where is Kamal?
2 It is Ibrim, I, I am a sorter.	What's going on down there?
3 Kamal is not here.  We are very defused.	Who's in charge then, where is Chinn?

1 Hello?	Stan, it's Chuck...Chuck Noland...

1 You've been over the line and you came back.  You've been saved, hallelujah!	Hallelujah.

1 It's not ergot, it's not pituitary extract, it's not oil of rue...	It claims to restore monthly regularity.

1 I suppose it wouldn't hurt to *meet* him. What's his name again?	Dr. Homer Wells.
2 I just hope he won't expect us to say *Grace* all the time.

1 How about him not needin' the friggin' compass! How about that?	Daddy, *please*...

1 You have to come to my dad's lobster pound and see one, then.	Okay...

1 What are you so crazy about the movies for?	It was my favorite night at the orphanage--movie night. We'd race into the dining hall. Of course everyone wanted to sit in front, so we'd be packed in so tight you could feel the kid next to you breathing.
2 At least you were never lonely.	I didn't say that. Growing up in an orphanage, you're always lonely. You're just never alone.

1 We should take her to St. Cloud's. That much is obvious, isn't it? Let her make up her mind when she gets there...	I told her! She doesn't feel she can do that. Something about her father not letting her go anywhere...
2 Well, we have to help her!

1 This came for you a couple of days ago. Olive asked me to bring it. With everything happening, I guess she forgot.	Sure. Thanks.

1 Wally thinks apples are boring.	I never said they were boring.
2 You said, "Apples aren't exactly flying."	Well, they aren't.

1 I don't know! He's just leaving--  you're the one who says he needs to see the world!  *That's* what he'll do--he'll see the world!	He's leaving...

1 Don't get too excited, Fuzzy.	Why can't we have pumpkins for Christmas, too? We don't get any good presents at Christmas, anyway.

1 At what altitude?	I've got thirty-five minutes to climb to fifteen thousand feet--that's the first mountain pass.

1 Are we supposed to be up here? The rules said...	Homer, you the only one who's read them rules, so you the only one who feels like he's doin' somethin' wrong.

1 Merthiolate, ether, vulval pads, gauze--lots of gauze.	When it comes to this, you is the real thing--is that what you sayin'?

1 Where's the name sheet?	Nobody's named this one yet.
2 It's my turn!

1 I am not a doctor.	You know everything I know, plus what you've taught yourself--you're a better doctor then I am and you know it!

1 There's a little something wrong with it. Just this part here--the right ventricle. It's slightly enlarged.	So what?
2 Yes, so what. It's nothing serious, really. Just a small defect.

1 Who cares?	Now, now. He's a good boy.
2 Shit. We don't know what he is.	Jack, you gotta watch your language 'round my daughter.

1 Ain't you gonna see what it is, Homer?	Mind your own business, Peaches.
2 Sorry, Homer...

1 That what happen--you lost you only daughter so's you killed yourself! That's what we say, all right.	That's right. I know you understand how I feel, Homer--you is breakin' them rules, too. Ain't that right?

1 Rose Rose has runned away!	She took off in the night!
2 She took off on the bicycle, man.

1 Uh, right... And that was it. That's when we decided to start our own business. No more shithead bosses.	I envy you guys. Taking a chance like that.

1 It can erase all those things about you that you wish didn't exist.	It's Alfonse. I want to settle up. I haven't been ducking you. I told you I'd get it.

1 Nice.	We got our stake. Now we need to find our guy in Gillett's bank.

1 Ten is standard, sir.	Fine. But only if we recover the cash.

1 Jake...	It's alright. Grant's one of the good guys.

1 You gotta be kidding me. Her?	Yes, her. Where's my wallet?

1 You'll be there?	Eight A.M. flight.
2 Calls?	We'll use the Euc.

1 How much?	I think two million.
2 What do you need from me? Permission? Go! If you can fleece him for two million, then do it, Kid.	I need you to stake me.
3 Stake you?	I need you to stake me. I can't do it without it. It's just a couple hundred grand. Taken out of our cut when we're done.

1 Special Agent Gunther Moonan. Ring a bell?	Gunther? I think I'd remember a Gunther.
2 Ring it for him, Sobo.

1 I can't be here! You understand? I can't --	Listen to me! It went to shit. It happens sometimes.

1 No.  What's my cut?	You get an equal cut.
2 What do I have to do?	Just play a part. A little acting.

1 Look at you... You want to go.	For what? A couple hundred bucks?
2 I think you'd do it for free. You're almost drooling. You like the rush.	It's what I do. It's my job.
3 Why? Your mother not breast feed you or something?	Are you asking me if I have something to prove?
4 Do you have something to prove?	Not in that repressed anger sort of way.
5 I'm your basic underachiever. Can't stand working and porn doesn't seem like a good option.	Good quality porn has it's place in the world.
6 Whatever. But you... I get the feeling you could have bullshitted your way into anything. So why this?	I'm good at it. Lying, cheating, manipulating... I'm good at it.
7 It's more than that.	Intuition. It doesn't make you Yoda. Like tonight. You killed that guy tonight. But I knew you would.
8 So that was my part? Smile and shake my ass?	No. You have another part? You'll know what to do.
9 How do you know I will?	Intuition.

1 Jesus... Take it easy.	No, I'm not going to take it easy. You can't stay clear of this guy. He will be on this until the end of time.

1 Yeah.	You better get over to Al's. Now.

1 It never worked before because A, they didn't flush the bank enough; B, their corporate papers were for shit; C, they didn't have someone on the inside with Customs.	Yeah, or D, it's a dumb fucking idea...
2 Then what do you want to do, Miles? Run?	We never had a problem with that before.
3 Yeah, well we never had this kind of problem before.	What are you talking about? Yes we have. And we would have been beautiful about it. We would've had a bucket of chicken delivered to the King with a nice kiss my ass card attached to it. Then we woulda moved on 'til the next local putz caught on.
4 We're getting a little old for running.	Yeah, well we're still a little young for Albany State Prison. Are you pissed about Al? I'm pissed too, but I'm not like "twenty-five to life" pissed.
5 I'm getting clear of this. If you're not going to do it for the fucking principle, do it for the money. Gordo?

1 Excuse me? I believe you're holding something far me under Pearson.	Do you have a ticket?
2 You know, this is kind of embarrassing, but my wallet was stolen yesterday and I'm afraid the ticket was in it. But the name's Pearson.

1 What's up with you? Bladder infection?	Keep it up.

1 Still time.	Can't do it Suits. I can't lay down for this one.
2 Okay. Here's the thing... You fall flat, you might not get anything short of stiffed. Then it's Blue River Land for everybody. Papers like these are dangerous because papers tend to multiply, then they start to take shape. Usually it's the shape of an arrow. I hate to do it, but after this, I gotta give you the blowoff. We Jake, Jake?

1 If you Feds are so hot for him, why don't we just bring him in right now?	I want him for something big and to do that, we have to catch him in the act.

1 Hope so. Those fucking orthodontist bills are killing me. One fifty every time they tighten those bitches up. One fifty! It's not even covered.	It's cosmetic. They don't cover cosmetic. Last year I had a tooth capped. The dentist tells me I'm not covered for caps. It's cosmetic.

1 The Indian rope-trick.	Look, now I'm pumping you. I'm sorry. It's none of my business. It's just that you're not like the others.
2 Not like Matt, you mean.	Now he's a real shit. Don't get friendly with him. I'm sure he's got his hand in the till. You know what he said to me once? "I want to fuck the whole world over. That's my mission." The shit!

1 I thought it was you. It's the hair!	I'm working on that soccer story.
2 Right.  Look, I must get back to Habib.	Habib?
3 My author. He's a Terrorist. He's written a kill-and-tell book.  Take care.

1 You really are a beautiful woman.	It's not just inner beauty, is it?
2 Turn around.

1 When you get home, I'm asleep. When I leave home, you're asleep.	I'll see you in my dreams.

1 Aren't you ever tempted to gamble?	Never. Why do you ask?
2 I can just imagine, being around so much money all the time...	Gambling's not about money.
3 Really?	Gambling's about not facing reality. Ignoring the odds.

1 I've lived there.	Well, thank you anyway.

1 I'm in trouble.	What kind of trouble?
2 I owe a lot of money.	Was that why you did the two grand? I couldn't help you.
3 I know that. But you can now.	I don't have any money.  switches on the light. JANI is looking distressed.
4 Some people I know, they're planning to rob The Golden Lion.

1 Is it yes?	Yes.
2 Thank you.

1 Nice car. How much did you pay for it?	Too much. Eighteen hundred.

1 Hey Jack, join us.	No thanks.
2 Don't worry, I won't report you!	I don't gamble.

1 Where did you go to school?	I was at Beadles.
2 I don't think I know that one. Private, I suppose.

1 Let me just run through a few things. As a dealer you never gamble, not anywhere. We'll need your picture.	What for?
2 For the database. It can be accessed by every casino in the country. We have the same system for punters.	I don't gamble.
3 Ever?	I don't gamble, Mr Reynolds.

1 How do you feel, Jack?	Bruised.
2 Take your time. Two weeks. Three if you need it. We'll pay you sick leave. I don't want to lose you. You're a good man. Here...

1 We've got to disarm the bomb.	Doolittle, are you there?

1 Well, bomb, we have about sixty seconds to drop. Just wondering if everything is all right. Have you checked your platinum euridium energy shielding?	Energy shielding positive function.
2 Swell. Let's synchronize detonation time. Do you know when you're supposed to go off?	Detonation in six minutes, twenty seconds.
3 All right, I have detonation time at... Wait a minute, something's wrong with the clock.  All right, I have detonation time at... no, that can't be right, it says three years.  Okay, I have six minutes exactly. Does that check out down there?	Check at six minutes.
4 Arm yourself, bomb.

1 Hello, bomb, are you with me?	Of course.
2 Are you willing to entertain a few concepts?	I am always receptive to suggestions.
3 Fine. Think about this one, then: how do you know you exist?

1 Commander Powell would have named it.	Commander Powell is dead.

1 You know what I think about, Talby?	I'm getting something here, on this readout...
2 It's funny, but I kind of sit around, you know, a lot of time to myself...	I think I'm getting a malfunction here somewhere.
3 I can't talk to the others, but with time to myself, I think about back home, back home at Malibu. I used to surf a lot, Talby. I used to be a great surfer.	Lieutenant Doolittle, I'm getting a definite malfunction on one of the closed-circuit computer systems...
4 The waves at Malibu and Zuma were fantastic in the springs Talby. I can remember running out on the beach early spring mornings with my board and a wet suit...	I can't seem to locate the malfunction exactly...
5 Waves would be peaking really high and glassy. Hit that water. Ridin' the wall just perfect.	...Somewhere in the autonomic relay circuits...
6 I guess I miss the waves and my board most of all.

1 Commander Powell? Commander, hello!	Doolittle, hello?
2 Sorry, sir, you faded out there for a minute.	Sorry.
3 What were you saying, Commander, about the bomb?	Ah... it seems to me, Doolittle... Sorry, I've drawn a blank. Hold it. I'll have it again in a minute. I forget so many things in here, so many things. Hold on, just a minute, let me think...

1 You're attractive, you're smart.  Stand on your own two feet, know what I mean? And you got a wicked sense of humor. Man, you really zinged the boss a couple times, it was all I could do--	Sooo...whattya think?  Maybe after I betray the woman who trusts me and you take her and her daughter out and execute them...we could go on a date.  Play a little miniature golf or somethin'.

1 Move it.	Where?

1 Out there.	No way.
2 Unless you wanna end up in jail, let me and Kendra handle the cops.

1 I made you coffee.  That oughta help you cope with the injustice of the world a little.	Thanks, it's starting to kick in.  I feel almost human.
2 Yeah, me too.

1 What makes you cry?	If I'm sad, or tired, or sometimes when I'm angry or when somebody's being mean to me.
2 Pretty much the same reasons I was crying.  But things will be better when we move to a new place.	Then I'm gonna do what you do to make me feel better when I'm sad.

1 Ever notice how cats always seem to turn up around dinner time?	I won't be staying.
2 I'm not a half bad cook.

1 Christmas is a snap when you got no parents or relatives, just a bunch of gene sequences from probably twenty different people.	Like extra virgin olive oil, the best of the best.
2 You said you could help.	I need to find this technician, or anyone else who knows about Project Manticore. They would've used surrogate mothers to carry you after the in-vitro work... If I can track down one of them.
3 What's in it for you?	Your help.
4 I already don't like the sound of this.	The woman you met, Lauren.  She supervised workers removing cortodiazapine from gel caps by hand and replacing it with powdered sugar.  The real drug was shipped out of the country. The placebos were distributed to County VA Hospital and six veterans' clinics in the area.
5 That's low, but this effects me how exactly?	She's prepared to testify that she was instructed to do this by one of Edgar Sonrisa's managers.  You know who Sonrisa is?
6 Yeah, I catch your hacks.  He's Satan's lap dog, or something.	So, you know the lengths he'll go to keep her from going public... I'm turning Lauren over to Canadian law enforcement tomorrow.  They'll put her in witness protection, but if you're with her the risk of her safety goes way down.
7 I didn't make it this far by attracting a lot of attention.	She's put her life on the line, and her faith in me.
8 They want me...bad.  Or at least they don't want me grabbed up by the Chinese or whoever.  Best case, I wind up back in that facility.  More likely, it's a long drive out in the country, if you know what I mean.

1 Know where I can find her?	You don't want to.
2 But she does work here?	She may be easy on the eyes but she's trouble, trust me.  Hot run to two-oh-two Sansomme.
3 I need to talk to her.	Can't help you.

1 Guy says he made the trade in Gillette, Wyoming sometime in the fall of oh-nine.	Then what?
2 Then what?  That's it.  That's all I got.	Nothing on Hannah?
3 A nuclear airburst wipes out every record of every kind in every computer east of the Rockies, and you want me to find some woman you met when you were seven, whose last name you don't even know... Maybe if you could give me something more on her...anything you can remember, some detail...

1 Morning, Sunshine...	Caught some son-of-a-bitch stealing my bike.  Used a car jack to blow out my U lock and bent a bunch of spokes.  So now I gotta get my wheels fixed.
2 At least he didn't swing with your ride.	No, but I broke a nail giving him a cranium crack and that just sort of wrecks your day, know what I'm saying?

1 Look, you're a player... I'm bringing you this on a plate, and my fee is just the normal cost of doing business.	Pull the cash.

1 You blew off your girlfriend last night, even though it was the big one-oh.  I'd be pissed off too if I was her.	Not half as pissed as she's gonna be when she finds out why I blew her off... I need your help, Max.

1 Thanks, miss.	You're too kind. I'm Amanda.
2 Right, well, thanks for the drinks and stuff, Amanda, but there's no reason for me to stick around these parts anymore.	Don't be so glum, Hawk. The night's still young and filled with plenty of compensatory possibilities.
3 Huh?	I'd be in a position to spend some money on you if you'd get in a position and spend some time on me.

1 Oh, Dicky, I c-c-can't...	You're not gonna chicken out on me now, are you? We've got your KISS song playing and everything.
2 I-I c-can't...	Look, people undress in public because, A, they're exhibitionists, B, they're nutcases, or C, they need the money. I can tell you're not A, and I hope to hell you're not B. So my suggestion is, think about why you're a C and let your body party, shake your groove thing, boogie oogie oogie till you just can't boogie no more.

1 Ann Arbor isn't... that far from Cleveland, right?	Nah. Once I get my own wheels, I could come up all the time.
2 That'd be great. Hey, maybe someday your band'll play there. It's a college town, you know?

1 Well, the least we, his only buds in the world, can do is take him along with us tonight and give him one last curl before he starts serving his sentence.	Just for the record, I understood the last part of what you said, but for a while there you guys were making no fucking sense whatsoever.
2 I was just explaining to Lex here what you and I already know. Just had to make it a little more complicated so he'd understand.

1 Shit, that dork is Jam.	YO, DOOFUS!

1 Now, how are we gonna do this?	Gimme a second, dudes. Lemme think.

1 Do you realize the sheer, goddamn, unadulterated, undiluted, no holds barred, one hundred percent pure as Ivory Snow, absolutely friggin' STUPIDITY of what you just did?	Hey, disco dude, it's cool...

1 Cool.	I'm really sorry about that, man.
2 Don't be a fembot. So, are you like grounded because of last night, or what?	Of course, but has that ever stopped me before? Besides, my mom's going to some church meeting and won't be back till late. No sweat... See you guys in school.

1 I'm sorry, guys. I thought it was a nice thing to do.	Jam, not another word out of your femmy-ass mouth! Okay, we're here, we got nothing, and we got an hour and a half. We're totally committed. It's time to brainstorm.

1 Mom, what're we...?	Just keep your lying, heathenous trap shut, Jeremiah.

1 Trip, a female gynecologist does not a lesbian make. And even if it did, at least my mom didn't give birth to me while she was on LSD.	Shrooms! And even if it was LSD, I can still give my mom a kiss without smelling the catch of the day.

1 About fuckin' time if you ask me. I'm just going through the motions till I drop out anyway.	Hello summer detention.

1 Please, sir, don't kick my ass! I'll do anything to get out of a beating!	Say, Chongo, perhaps we could use some extra cash for tasty snacks at the KISS concert our weasly friend won't be attending.

1 I feel bad for his family.	Yeah.
2 Did you know him?

1 Did you tell them that I flooded the school?	I didn't say shit.
2 That's not what I heard. Now they think I did it.	Well, if you're innocent, then you have nothing to worry about.
3 You know what? I think that you did it.

1 Wanna walk me home?	Sure.

1 It's like this big force... that's in your brain. But sometimes it grows bigger... and it spread down into your arms and legs... and it just sends you someplace.	So when you sleepwalk, you go somewhere familiar?
2 No. Every time I wake up somewhere different. Sometimes my bike is laying there next to me. Like once when I woke up on the edge of this cliff up on Carpathian Ridge.	And you'd never been there before?

1 So, we call them... IMGs.	Infant Memory Generators.
2 Yeah. So the idea is that... you buy these glasses for your infant, and they wear them at night when they sleep.	And inside these glasses are these slide photographs. And each photograph is of something peaceful... or beautiful. Whatever pictures the parent wants to put inside.

1 Is that a cellar door?	Yeah...

1 So how was school today?	It was great. We had peanut-butter sandwiches and apples and honey at snacktime. And then during show-and- tell, my stuffed walrus was a big hit.
2 Good Lord.  So the construction guys say it'll take about a week to fix the roof. Damn airline better not fuck us on the shingle match.	Do they know yet?
3 Know what?	Where it came from?
4 No... apparently they can't tell us what happened yet. Something about a matching serial number that got burned.  But I had to sign a form saying I wouldn't talk to anyone about it.	So we're not supposed to tell anybody what nobody knows?
5 You tell Dr. Thurman whatever you want.

1 What's "Cellar Door"?	A famous linguist once said... that of all the phrases in the English language, of all the endless combinations of words in all of history... that "Cellar Door" is the most beautiful.

1 And they grow out of our stomachs?	It was just like she described them in her book. Like they were alive. The way that they looked... moved... smelled. They were like workers... assigned to each one of us.  I followed my spear... and I found something...
2 What did you find?

1 Whoa, Elizabeth. A little hostile, there. Maybe you should be the one in therapy. Then Mom and Dad can pay someone two hundred dollars an hour to listen to all of your thoughts... so we won't have to.	Maybe you'd like to tell Mom and Dad why you stopped taking your medication.

1 If that's what you think is necessary.	But let me remind you that this treatment is... experimental.

1 Christ. Is that an axe?	Yep.
2 How did this happen?	I guess they made him do it.

1 What is this shit?	Raspberry.

1 Oh, Mom's okay. They're just givin' her a ride back. She almost blew outta the back of Loretta's pick-up on the way over.	Thank God for bunge cords.
2 ...Yah -- well, at least, y'know, I got to perform. And Mom got to see me.  I guess number eight only worked for Diane Sawyer...

1 I'm lucky I have an after-school job where I can practice my talent.	Oh, yeah, sure. You know, every pageant is special, but this one is extra-special to me. When I was seventeen, I don't know if you know this, but I was crowned Mount Rose's American Teen Princess. And this year... drum roll please, my lovely daughter, Rebecca Ann Leeman is competin'.

1 Ow!	Would yous boys excuse us a second? Loretta, you too.

1 If you're gettin' at somethin', you better just say it.	I just did.
2 Well then, you better be willin' to back it up, 'cause you're talkin' like crazy.

1 Well, uh, I'm cuttin' out early today to do a little duck huntin'... but, uh, maybe I could call you tonight.	Yah-sure, fine... fine.
2 Okay... well, bye.	Bye.

1 Well, it's all happenin' so fast. Goodness-gracious, it hardly seems real, y'know? I mean, I won! I'm the winner! I'm going to State!	She's the winner and we're going to state.

1 Yah -- she's damn near as good as that little black fella -- with the glass eye.	Sammy Davis, Jr., honey.
2 Yeah, yeah, the Jew.

1 Oh! What is it?	"Proud... to be... an... American."

1 Mom, I just finished the third movement of that concerto I was working on. I put, like, this techno beat on this Japanese folk tune -- wanna hear it?	No! We not like to hear it! Go to your room and shut up!
2 Oh, I almost forgot...  I got my acceptance to Tokyo University.	What, you deaf? I say shut up -- shut up -- SHUT UP!  Cut her outta this!

1 Who to?	None of your business...  Take another letter.

1 My card.	That's a-no good.  You gotta insult somebody from another country.  Look --  I come from one country.  You come from another country.  I say something you don't like.  You say something I don't like - and I'm insulted.
2 Why wasn't I insulted?	You was insulted, but you don't know it.
3 Then I demand an apology!	That's a-no good.  If I apologize we no got a war.  Look -- I send you a scrap of paper.  You send me a scrap of paper -- and we have a scrap.
4 You've got a brain after all - and how you get along without it is amazing to me -- Now, who can I insult?...  Who do we owe money to?...  AMBASSADOR TRENTINO!  How about him?	He's-a very easy to insult --  I say something to his niece once, and he slapped my face.
5 Why didn't his niece slap your face?	She did.
6 What did you say to her?

1 With a gun like that you can kill some of your own men.	That's-a pretty good.  I'll take a dozen of them.
2 Anything else? 	Yes, one gross of bullets, two dozen hand-grenades, three kegs of powder -- and throw in some matches.
3 Fine.  We'll throw in the matches before we make the delivery.  By the way, how're you fixed for spys?	Fine.  We gotta him. 
4 So! -- He's on your side, too.	Sure.
5 Well, with you two fellows on the other side, this country should have no trouble keeping the wolf from the door.

1 That's even a greater honor.	I bring you the greetings of my President and the good will of my people.
2 I'll keep the greetings -- but you can send back the good will... what we need right now is twenty million dollars.	Twenty million dollars is a considerable sum...  I'll have to discuss that with my Minister of Finance.
3 Well, in the meantime, could you let me have $50 personally?	$50?
4 I'll tell you what I'll do.  I'll give you Mrs. Teasdale as security.  or my jackknife.  If you want my advice, you'll take the jackknife... I've a better proposition...  Make it $25 and I'll give you a first mortgage on my son and I hope you foreclose.	Your Excellency, haven't we met before?
5 Why yes.  I met you at the dog races -- say, you could have won that race if you tried a little harder.

1 In choosing you, I feel that I serve my country well.  I heartily endorse everything you stand for.	Well, I won't stand for much.  And I won't stand for you if you don't show some improvement soon.  Look at your report card last month -- "D" in spelling...  six in behavior. Now who were the six?  A fine state of affairs -- no wonder you can't matriculate, now what were you saying?
2 The future of Freedonia rests upon you.  Promise me you will follow in my husband's footsteps.	I haven't been on the job five minutes and already she's making advances to me.  Not that I care -- but where is your husband?
3 Why - er -- my husband passed away...  I was with him to the very end.	No wonder he passed away.  I'd like to be with you to the very end. Can't you see what I'm trying to tell you -- I love you.
4 Your Excellency!	You're not so bad yourself, Mrs. Teasdale, when I look at you I can see that we're facing a crisis. We've got to balance the budget -- we've got to cut down everything including, you.

1 I -- I may be wrong, but I suspect the Secretary of War.	Don't bother me - I'm thinking -- What was that?
2 I said - I suspect the Secretary of War.	THIS IS TREASON!!  What a fool I was to listen to your siren song and fall a helpless victim under the insidious spell of your irresistible charms --
3 But -	You satisfied your selfish whims, while nations tottered, dynasties rocked and the world plunged headlong into a chasm of chaos and oblivion --  Not bad, eh?

1 If only we can get his Excellency to listen to reason...	Perhaps he will listen to you...

1 Perhaps you're just polishing a stone, endowing this Elephant Man with qualities he doesn't possess?	And what qualities are those? Intelligence or stupidity?
2 I'm sure I don't know, Freddie.

1 Don't!	Shut up!

1 A hospital is no place for secrecy, Mr. Treves. Doctors spiriting hooded figures about are liable to cause comment. Why wasn't this patient properly admitted, and why is he in isolation? Is he contagious?	No sir, he's got bronchitis and he's been badly beaten.
2 Why isn't he in the General Ward, then?	Well sir, he's quite seriously deformed, and I fear the other patients would find him... rather shocking.
3 Deformed? Is that it. Then am I to assume that he is ultimately incurable?	Yes sir.
4 What are your plans then, Treves... You are aware that the London does not accept incurables. The rules are quite clear on that point.	Yes, I'm well aware of that. But this case is quite exceptional.
5 Oh, is he a friend of yours?	No, more of an acquaintance.

1 Can you imagine what his life has been like?	Yes, I think I can.
2 No you can't. You can't begin to know, no one can.

1 How long has this man been here?	Three quarters of an hour.
2 Mmmm. Hodges, Pierce come closer. Mr. Hill, take hold of the rope please. It's a machine accident. I expect you'll be seeing a good deal of this.

1 Have you read it?	No, but I certainly shall.

1 What? Oh! I see! It's St. Phillips. Oh, of course. Why... why that's very good, I mean you've gotten the windows and arches just right.	Yes.
2 But it's so good, I mean... it's so very good.	Thank you... very much.
3 Where did you get this box?

1 ...Yes potatoes... but...	But the variety of food here is very pleasing... I commend you.

1 Good morning, John.	Good morning.
2 John, there's someone here who would like to meet you. Would that be alright?

1 Mr. Treves! Treves.	John.... how can you ever forgive me?

1 Good Lord, Mr. Treves!	We've made tremendous strides today, Mothershead. He listens and repeats with great attention, and this certainly isn't easy for him.
2 Parrots can do as much, Mr. Treves. It's all very nice, but I don't see the point. You know they won't let him stay here.	I'm sure that if Mr. Merrick made a good impression on the hospital committee they'd see that he's the exception to their rule. Now I'm not expecting miracles. I'm not saying he'll be able to read or write, but I do think that I can get him to speak for himself. I'm going to arrange things with Carr Gomm right now.  That was very good, John, very good. That's all for today. We shall do some more tomorrow. Mothershead?

1 Open up! I know you're in there!	Ah! It's my father!
2 Open up! I know you're in there!

1 Please! Please! What are those?	What are what?
2 Those things in your hands.	These? What are THESE? They're swords.

1 And thanks for the Cloak Invisible!	No! WAIT! ERIK! The Cloak! The Cloak Invisible! It only seems to work on my father!

1 But... How is it you can see me?  You can all see me?	What d'you mean?

1 What's the matter, don't you WANT to hear our singing?	Oh... well, yes, of course; it's just we're looking for the Horn Resounding and --
2 You don't think our singing's going to be good enough for you?	Oh, no no no! It's just the Horn Resounding is...
3 A lot of people like our singing.	I'm sure it's lovely.
4 But you don't want to hear it.	No... no...  We'd love to hear it. Wouldn't we?

1 He's trying to stop us waking the Gods.	Why?
2 Because that's how he makes his money, by war and plunder!	Don't talk nonsense.
3 He wants to kill US!	Not when we explain about the Great Blessing.
4 You don't know Halfdan the Black.	I know that the Great Blessing has kept the peace for a thousand years, and will keep it for the next thousand.

1 Have you tried to ask the God for anything?	Well... no...

1 Let's hack her to pieces.	No.

1 Slower! Nobody can row at that speed!	Sorry.

1 You must help us.	We don't HAVE to help anybody.
2 Fenrir the Wolf covers the sun -- men fight and kill each other the whole time.	Why should WE care?
3 Because... you're... you're the Gods....	So?
4 Bring the Age of Ragnarok to an end and stop all this fighting and bloodshed.

1 Weren't we supposed to?	Oh... I feel a little... oh...

1 Well, what else do we do?	How about making friends?

1 I AM one, Dad!	We haven't got a spare place.

1 It can't do you any HARM...	What do we have to do?
2 Nothing... I just immerse you in water...

1 Aaagh!	Got you!

1 Are you going to let Erik wake the Gods?	How can we stops him now?

1 We're being attacked! KILL! Kill! Kill!	Not now, Sven...
2 I must KILL! Kill!	It's no good going berserk against a dragon!

1 Well... I'm game.	Me too.

1 I remember you turned around. Your face was dark and your hair was backlit -- I could see a halo of frizz -- you asked me if things were okay between Naomi and me.	I did. You said, things were fine.
2 I remember.	This is the night you met Clementine, Joel. I remember watching you walk down the beach with her and I thought, oh shit.
3 Yeah, you told me that later.	I told you that later.

1 It's so cool. You're by far the most sensational person in the room.	In the room?
2 In the world.

1 Really?	Well, I didn't want to assume.
2 Aw, c'mon, live dangerously. Take the leap and assume someone is talking to you in an otherwise empty car.	Anyway. Sorry. Hi.

1 Thanks very much. That was very nice of you.	Well, I wouldn't want to be --
2 Oh, geez, I'm full of shit. I already told you that.  Anyway. See Ya.

1 You're really nice. I'm sorry I yelled at you before about it. God, I'm an idiot.	I do have a tendency to use that word too much.
2 I like you. That's the thing about my psychic thing. I think that's my greatest psychic power, that I get a sense about people. My problem is I never trust it. But I get it. And with you I get that you're a really good guy.	Thanks.
3 And, anyway, you sell yourself short. I can tell. There's a lot of stuff going on in your brain. I can tell. My goal... can I tell you my goal?	Yeah.
4 What's the goal, Joel?  My goal, Joel, is to just let it flow through me? Do you know what I mean? It's like, there's all these emotions and ideas and they come quick and they change and they leave and they come back in a different form and I think we're all taught we should be consistent. Y'know? You love someone -- that's it. Forever. You choose to do something with your life -- that's it, that's what you do. It's a sign of maturity to stick with that and see things through. And my feeling is that's how you die, because you stop listening to what is true, and what is true is constantly changing. You know?	Yeah. I think so. It's hard to --
5 Like I wanted to talk to you. I didn't need any more reason to do it. Who knows what bigger cosmic reason might exist?	Yeah.
6 You're very nice. God, I have to stop saying that. You're nervous around me, huh?	No.
7 I'm nervous. You don't need to be nervous around me, though. I like you. Do you think I'm repulsively fat?	No, not at all.
8 I don't either. I used to. But I'm through with that. Y'know, if I don't love my body, then I'm just lost. You know? With all the wrinkles and scars and the general falling apart that's coming 'round the bend.  So, I've been seeing this guy...

1 Let me drive you home.	Fuck you, Joel. Faggot.
2 Look at it out here. It's falling apart. I'm erasing you. And I'm happy.

1 Joely...	Yeah, Tangerine?
2 Do you know The Velveteen Rabbit?	No.
3 It's my favorite book. Since I was a kid. It's about these toys. There's this part where the skin Horse tells the rabbit what it means to be real.  I can't believe I'm crying already. He says, "It takes a long time. That's why it doesn't often happen to people who break easily or have sharp edges, or who have to be carefully kept. Generally by the time you are Real, most of your hair has been loved off, and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very shabby. But these things don't matter at all, because once you are Real you can't be ugly, except to people who don't understand."

1 Joel!	I don't like it either, but I'm just trying to find horrible secret place to --

1 Hi there.	Hi.

1 I do sort of live with somebody though.	Oh.

1 I don't know. What if it breaks?	What if?

1 Hi, Naomi, it's Joel.	Hi.
2 How's it going?	Good. I called you at work today. They said you were home sick.
3 I know. I had to take the day to think.	Yeah, I tried you at home. Did you get my message?
4 I just got in.	Long day thinking.

1 Gotta get home. How could she do this to me? How could she not care about what we meant to each other. What a fuck! What a fucking monster she is!	Oh, God. I miss her. I can't believe she's with that guy now! I'm never going to see her again. I love her so much. What a fucking monster she is!

1 Clementine.	I couldn't believe you did that. I was paralyzed with fear.

1 So you don't mind?	I've got to finish this chapter anyway.

1 Stan... c'mon...	Sorry. I just --
2 It's just... y'know... I mean...	I know. Anyway --
3 Anyway, I've got to do my tap dance here.

1 No way. I can handle this.	This guy's only half cooked. There's no time to fuck around, Stan.

1 Mary...	Yes?
2 Order me a pastrami for after?	Cole slaw, ice tea?
3 Thanks.	Welcome, Howard.

1 Stan? What's going on?	The guy we're doing? He's disappeared from the map. I can't find him anywhere.
2 Okay, what happened right before he disappeared?	I was away from the monitor for a second. I had it on automatic. I had to go pee.
3 Well, where was Patrick?	He went home sick.
4 Jesus. All right, what's the address.	1062 Sherman Drive. Apartment 1E, Rockville Center.

1 This book -- It's essential that people read it because --  -- It's the truth. And only I know it.	Maybe after the holidays then.

1 I'm a friend of Bonanza Jellybean's.	I know who you are.
2 Oh? Well, there's been some trouble on the ranch. I came up here to get out of the way. It's so dark now I doubt if I could find my way back down. If you could help...	Save your breath for the climb.

1 Well, if the Clock People give you any inside information on the end of the world, drop us a postcard.	The world isn't going to end, you dummy; I hope you know that much.  But it is going to change. It's going to change drastically, and probably in your lifetime. The Clock People see calamitous earthquakes as the agent of change, and they may be right, since there are a hundred thousand earthquakes a year and major ones are long overdue. But there are far worse catastrophes coming... unless the human race can bring itself to abandon the goals and values of civilization, in other words, unless it can break the consumption habit -- and we are so conditioned to consuming as a way of life that for most of us life would have no meaning without the yearnings and rewards of progressive consumption. It isn't merely that our bad habits will cause global catastrophes, but that our operative political-economic philosophies have us in such a blind crab grip that they prevent us from preparing for the natural disasters that are not our fault. So the apocalyptic shit is going to hit the fan, all right, but there'll be some of us it'll miss. Little pockets of humanity. Like the Clock People. Like you two honeys, if you decide to accept my offer of a lease on Siwash Cave. There's almost no worldwide calamity -- famine, nuclear accident, plague, weather warfare or reduction of the ozone shield -- that you couldn't survive in that cave.

1 ......Delores zonks out on peyote at least once a week, but so far her Third Vision hasn't happened. Niwetkame, the Mother Goddess has not gotten back in touch with her. Meanwhile she and Debbie are rivaling each other like a couple of crosstown high schools. Tension. Cowgirl tension! What a drag.	What is Debbie's position?
2 Debbie says that if women are to take charge again, they must do it in the feminine way; they mustn't resort to aggressive and violent masculine methods. She says it is up to women to show themselves better than men, to love men, set good examples for them and guide them tenderly toward the New Age. She's a real dreamer, that Debbie-dear.	You don't agree with Debbie, then?
3 I wouldn't say that. I expect she's right, ultimately. But I'm with Delores when it comes to fighting for what's mine. I can't understand why Delores is so uptight about the Chink; he could probably teach her a thing or two. Ee! That grass tickles, doesn't it? God knows I love women, but nothing can take the place of a man that fits. Still this is cowgirl territory and I'll stand with Delores and fight any bastards who might deny it. I guess I've always been a scrapper. Look. This scar. Only twelve years old and I was felled by a silver bullet.

1 Going north?	You bet your raggedy white ass I am.

1 Sissy, don't play dumb with me! You're a good model but a shitty actress. The cowgirls are involved in this whooping crane disappearance. You know perfectly well they are. Last seen in Nebraska. Didn't make it to Canada. Siwash Lake is between Nebraska and Canada. The cowgirls have possession of Siwash Lake. And who else but Jellybean's wild cunts could possibly conceive of doing something so diabolical as to tamper with the last flock of some nearly extinct birds? How much do you know about it? Have they murdered those cranes the way they murdered my moo cows?	I don't know anything about it.
2 Sissy. You're trying to protect those scuzzy bitches. Well, let your conscience be your guide, as my mommy used to say, but it won't work. Those stinking sluts are going to suffer...

1 From what?	You're convinced the crew could still be alive? After seven years?

1 Damn, Dr. Weir, don't scare us like that. Coffee?	What?
2 Coffee.	No, thank you.

1 He's a rescue technician. Peters, medical technician. DJ...	Trauma.
2 And this is mission specialist Dr. William Weir. We all know where we're going. Dr. Weir is going to tell us why.

1 Do you hear it? Right there.	Hear what?
2 It sounds like "ex infera:" "ex," from; "infera," the ablative case of "inferi." "Hell."	"Save yourself. From Hell."  What are you saying, are you saying that this ship is possessed?
3 No. I don't believe in that sort of thing.  But if Dr. Weir is right, this ship has passed beyond the boundaries of our universe, of reality. Who knows where this ship has been... What it's seen...  And what it's brought back with it.

1 That ship was lost in deep space, seven years ago. If the Titanic sailed into New York harbor, I'd find it more plausible.  Houston wants Aerospace to send out a search and rescue team, investigate the source of the transmission. If it really is the Event Horizon, they'll attempt a salvage.  We need you to prepare a detailed briefing on the ship's systems for the salvage crew...	A written briefing can't possibly anticipate the variables on a mission like this. I have to go with them.

1 I've reached another containment door. This thing's huge...	That's the Second Containment Seal. Beyond that, engineering.
2 I'm going in.

1 We've got pressure.	Clear and open on my mark. Three... two... one... mark.

1 Can anybody hear me...	Skipper...
2 Peters...	...you okay?
3 Yeah. I'm -- I'm okay.

1 Dr. Weir, I need you on the bridge.	Captain, I didn't come out here to sit on your bridge, I need to be on that ship...
2 Once the ship is secured, we'll bring you on board --	That is not acceptable --
3 -- once we've secured the ship, that's the way it is!  I need you to guide us from the comm station. This is where I need you. Help us to do our job.

1 I want this room sealed. The Second Containment is off limits.	There's no danger. The black hole is contained behind three magnetic fields, it's under control.
2 Your black hole damn near ripped my ship apart. It may have killed one of my men.  No one goes near that thing.

1 What about my ship?	We will take the Lewis and Clark to a safe distance and then launch tac missiles at the Event Horizon until I am satisfied that she has been destroyed.  Fuck this ship.
2 You... You can't do that!	Watch me.

1 Jesus...	What is that?

1 Captain Miller...	Smith, where the hell have you been?!
2 We have a situation here...

1 Where is it, where is it...	Smith? Smith! Fuck!

1 What's the point? I'll just get the same thing...	Not acceptable. I want to know what's causing those readings. If the crew is dead, I want the bodies, I want the crew found.
2 I can reconfigure the scan for C-12, amylase proteins.	Do it. Dr. Weir...

1 I'm on my way, Starck.	You better hurry. He's engaged the override, we can't open the inner door.

1 Claire...	DJ!  It's okay. You're okay. Just breathe.

1 We have to do something, oh God...	Skipper, Justin just activated the door. It's on a thirty second delay...

1 I can't believe this, I haven't gotten more than my hand in six weeks and now this shit. Why not Mars, Cap, Mars has women...	Smith's right. Neptune? There's nothing out there. If something happens, we'll be on our own.

1 Relativity, yes. We can't break the law of relativity, but we can go around it. The ship doesn't really move faster than the speed of light; it creates a dimensional gateway that allows the ship to instantaneously "jump" from one point in the universe to another, light years away.	How?
2 Well, in layman's terms, you use a rotating magnetic field to focus a narrow beam of gravitons; these in turn fold space-time consistent with Weyl tensor dynamics until the space- time curvature becomes infinitely large and you have a singularity...

1 In our current environment, Dr. Weir, self-control is an asset.	I'm alright. Please.

1 You don't know what it's like out there. Walking around like some kind of circus freak. People staring, whispering --	I wouldn't know anything about that.
2 I mean...	Tell me. When you grew up in Brooklyn, how many astronauts did you know?  You went your own way then. You didn't listen to people. So why start now...?

1 What are you doing here?	I'm worried about you.
2 About me? How sweet.	Come on. Let me buy you something to eat. Looks like you could use the company.

1 What did you wish for, honey?	I already got it. Everything I want.

1 The shields on the station should protect us.	Should?

1 Okay. I've uh, got some questions, from Sue. That she thought might be better coming from me... Can you, you know, go to the bathroom... like normal...	Yeah.  You don't wanna know the details.
2 Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask --	Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
3 O-kay. We'll skip that question.

1 What's wrong with me?	I swear to you they've done everything humanly possible. The best plastic surgeons in the world, Ben. You had the best --
2 Give me a mirror...

1 Me like-y.	Stay right. Left is trouble.
2 I though we went over this.	Last one down springs for room service.

1 Back it down, Johnny!	I can go hotter!

1 Stop it.	Okay, "mom."

1 I'm sorry, sis, for leaving you guys --	No, I'm sorry, for pushing you out.

1 Make sure you find Ben, bring him back here. And keep it quiet. I don't need this to hit the press.	Yes sir. You've got the Mayor at eight, then a nine-thirty interview with the Journal --
2 Front page?	Top left, like you asked.  Today Wall Street. Tomorrow, who knows... maybe Washington.

1 Uh, Sue...? I can't.	What? What do you mean you --
2 Sue... look at your hands.

1 Reed. I was ready for the next step, you weren't, ergo, I walked.	I think it was a little more complicated than --
2 I just wanted to share an apartment. What was so complicated about that?

1 You know, I bribed the projectionist ten bucks to keep it open late?	I gave him twenty.

1 Got it. So take a walk, Ben... I'm going to borrow Susan for a second.	Sure.

1 Surprised I agreed to Reed's proposal?	I understand the business reasons.
2 Well, when you're looking at your future, it never hurts to find closure about the past.

1 Please don't make this personal --	Oh, I think you already have.
2 Victor, we can't do anything until the research is ready.

1 Go ahead. Just make it quick.	Totally.
2 It's the first door on your left.

1 Mom says to clean up the pool.	Why can't you do it?
2 Your friends use the pool. Your friends messed it up.	Your friends use the pool too.
3 I take out the garbage.	Don't strain yourself.

1 Any problems?	No, just a couple of surfers with no shirts on. I took care of it, Dennis.

1 I can't wait until I can drive next year. I walk every day. It's such a drag.	Get a ride with somebody.
2 Sometimes I get a ride with my brother. But he usually works in the mornings, and then drives to school himself.	What a guy.

1 I want you to know that it's your final decision if we should continue or not.	Let's continue.

1 Do you ever look at those girls who work at Swenson's? They're beautiful. And I have to stand out here and watch them six nights a week.	You should work for yourself.

1 Damone, are you there?	I'm really pretty busy...

1 All right, what you want to do is go to the Free Clinic and tell the doctor that you have sex regularly -- several times a week -- and that you need Nornel One Plus Fifty's.	And they don't call my parents?
2 Not if you're over sixteen.	Okay. Thanks a lot, Linda.
3 And don't let them talk you into a diaphragm either.

1 What the fuck is this guy doing?	This ain't no cop.

1 I can't believe I start high school tomorrow.	Believe it.

1 I should quit this job. I'm going to get so fat working here... nobody will ever take me out.	Stacy. How many times do I have to tell you? You are really going to be beautiful... someday.
2 Thanks a lot.

1 You have been acting very strange the last few weeks.	I don't know... I just don't feel right.

1 Hey! Wait a minute! There's no birthday party for me here!	Thank you, Desmond.  What's the reason for your truancy?
2 I couldn't make it in time.	You mean, you couldn't? Or you wouldn't?
3 I don't know, mon. The food lines took forever.	Food will be eaten on your time!  Why are you continuously late for this class, Mr. Spicoli? Why do you shamelessly waste my time like this?
4 I don't know.

1 You look like you could still be in high school.	I know, everyone says that.

1 What's your other question?	My other question is... can-I-have your-phone-number-so-I-can-ask-you out-sometime?

1 I had a really nice time tonight.	Me, too. I'm real sorry someone broke in and stole your tape deck.

1 Yeah? About fifty people I didn't know wrote that in my annual.	I know everybody says it, but I really mean it.

1 Let's have lunch!	Righto!

1 Cut their goddamn heads off. Every one of them. That's what we're doing in California.	WHAT?

1 "One toke over the line, sweet Jesus."	One toke. You poor fool. Wait till you see those goddamn bats.

1 Savage Henry has cashed his check! We're going to rip his lungs out!	And eat them! That bastard won't get away with this! What's going on in this country when a scum sucker like that can get away with sandbagging a Doctor of Journalism?

1 Total control now. Tooling along the main drag on a Saturday night in Vegas, two good old boys in a fire apple red convertible... stoned, ripped, twisted... Good people!	How about "Nickel Nick's Slot Arcade?" "Hot Slots," that sounds heavy. Twenty- nine cent hotdogs...
2 Look, what are we doing here? Are we here to entertain ourselves, or to do the job?	To do the job, of course. Here we go... a Crab Louie and quart of muscatel for twenty dollars!

1 Yeah... I thought we might need it...	What for?

1 You bastard! You'd do that, wouldn't you?	Why worry? You'll like it. Nothing in the world like a Mace high. Forty- five minutes on your knees with the dry heaves...
2 You cheap honky sonofabitch...	Why not? Hell, just a minute ago, you were asking me to kill you! And now you want to kill me! What I should do, goddamnit, is call the police!
3 The cops?	There's no choice. I wouldn't dare go to sleep with you wandering around with a head full of acid and wanting to slice me up with that goddamn knife!
4 Who said anything about slicing you up? I just wanted to carve a little Z on your forehead. Nothing serious.

1 I saw these bastards in Easy Rider, but I didn't believe they were real. Not like this. Not hundreds of them!	They're actually nice people when you get to know them.
2 Man, I know these people in my goddamn blood!	Don't mention that word around here. You'll get them excited.
3 This is a fucking nightmare.	Right. Sure as hell some dope-dealing bomb freak is going to recognize you and put the word out that you're partying with a thousand cops.

1 What is this?	You won't need much. Just a little tiny taste, that stuff makes pure mescaline seem like ginger-beer. Adrenochrome.

1 I was stupid with shock -- not knowing whether to run or start laughing.	How much is the lemon meringue pie?
2 Her eyes were turgid with fear, but her brain was functioning on some basic motor survival level.

1 The password is: "One Hand Washes The Other." The minute you hear that, you say "I fear nothing."	I fear nothing.

1 Oh Lord! I'd do just about anything for that!	You and a lot of other people.

1 You know where it is?	Um, yeah, thirty miles east.

1 I have a CB in my truck, we could get some help out here.	Who the hell would you call?
2 Anyone.

1 That's the oldest of the bunch, looked like the Grandpapa. We caught the little one, Junior, in the cooler there. As we've seen, what he lacks in size he more than makes up for in speed.	And the rest of 'em?
2 Unfortunately, the worst of 'em are still outside.

1 We just smeared a skunk.	Shit!

1 I'm telling ya, you got the cloth too deep, you're asking for it.	Oh yeah?

1 My truck can't be more than ten feet away. We load into the back, I can get in the front and we roll out of here.	What's in the back?
2 Nothing, this was my last delivery.

1 How much you got to see the show?	You don't understand sweety, Daddy doesn't pay, Daddy sees the show for free. But you do get points for being horny on a night like this.

1 This one will just stun ya, but this one will put ya to sleep.	Whoa!

1 Got 'cha!	HOLD THAT TIGHT!

1 COME ON!	HELLLLLLLLP!!

1 Okay, well... anybody else have an idea?	Is there any other way out of this place? ANYONE?

1 There's a rifle and a shotgun here.	That's fine.

1 You know you don't have to do this.	I'm fine, I really am.
2 I admire your strength.	We all have to be strong, right?
3 Right.

1 Well... you could always dump her, Mr. Bebe. Teach her a lesson. There are a million beautiful girls out there who don't give a damn about politics.	That's not the point. Frances Farmer has the world by the tit because of this studio, and now she thinks she can waltz off without a thank you. No. No, that young lady has a contract, and she's going to honor it.
2 Oh. I mean, good.	I think it's time to take the gloves off.  Get me some reporters.  Particularly Louella Parsons!

1 Face it! Confess it! You're weak!	I'm not!
2 You're afraid!	I'm not!
3 You don't want to show your whole soul -- ugly, mis-shapen, and pitiful -- you don't want to show it --	God damn it, Clifford, will you shut up! I tell you, I want to give these things! I want to give them to the audience, and I can give them, I will give them, so shut up!

1 Hey, where's the fire, sister?	In my eyes, officer.
2 Cool off, beautiful. Didn't you see the sign says "Dimout Zone?"  There's a war on, you know?	Come on. You're seriously trying to tell me the Japs can't find Los Angeles without my headlights?
3 I didn't make the law, lady. I just enforce it.

1 Harry? Oh Harry, I knew you'd come. I love you, Harry. I love... Take me home, Harry.	We'll get you home, Frances.
2 Thank you, Harry.

1 I love you, Mama.  I love you, Dad.	Be careful, Francie.

1 I'm going back to the hotel.	Good.
2 See you next weekend?	As usual. Everything as usual, Mr. Farmer. Just give me my due.

1 Momma told ya not to speak to strangers, huh?  Hey!	Don't touch me.
2 I'm not gonna hurt you. I just wanna talk.

1 Not bad. But come on, Harry; what's the real reason?	Kaminski.
2 Yeah, I read about that. Terrible business, suicide.	Since when do you believe the papers? They killed him, kid.
3 What?	They killed him. They threw him out that window.
4 Oh no...	Eight stories.

1 Two lines! Two fucking lines! 'My wife returns from Europe tomorrow. I can't see you any more.' Just like that!	Frances...
2 Harry, I hate being in love. I don't ever want to be in love again. I just hate it!

1 I don't think I'd be much good in a war...	Whattaya think you're in now?
2 I don't know. Not a war exactly. It's more a... a misapprehension maybe...	Huh?
3 A misunderstanding, people taking the wrong meaning from things. I wasn't declaring war, Harry. I was just saying my prayers.

1 Where to?	Oh Harry...

1 Yeah.	What'd you do?
2 You know, I've never been able to figure that out.

1 How's it sound?	The speech? Real good.
2 You think I got it?	You got it.
3 Yeah. Yeah, tonight I think I got it.

1 Well, who have we here...?	Frances, you remember my lawyer, Alma Styles?

1 Where are you going?	I'm going out!
2 You're not going anywhere!	Yes, I am, and you can't stop me! You can't tell me what to do, mother. I'm a grown woman, and I can decide about my own life.
3 Frances!

1 Do you expect me, for one moment, to believe you have greater insight into my personality than I do?	Please sit down...
2 You may discuss my predicament, Doctor. You may discuss it with anyone you like, but not with me. I'm not interested. I can solve my problems without recourse to a veternarian.	I see.
3 Besides, I don't want to be what you want to make me.	And what's that?
4 Normal. Average.	All right. Will you please sit down now?  Symington says.
5 ...Did you really say that?	Just a little joke, Miss Farmer.
6 This whole thing is a joke!	Stay calm, please.
7 No, you stay calm, Doctor! But you're finding that difficult, aren't you?  Why, are you attracted to me? Perhaps later, in some of our more intimate sessions... after we know each other a little better...  and you've torn my personality to shreds, and I'm weeping and vulnerable...  then you'll really get your kicks, won't you, "Doctor?"	I'll have someone show you to your room.
8 Oh, that's good, very professional. In control. But the tiny beads of sweat on your upper lip give you away.

1 You were with him at the end.	Yes.
2 I was watching.

1 In which part of me did this knowledge reside? In these hands? In this mind? In this heart?  And reading and speaking. Not things learned... so much as things remembered.	Trace memories in the brain, perhaps.
2 Stolen memories. Stolen and hazy. They taunt me in my dreams. I've seen a beautiful woman lying back and beckoning for me to love her. Whose woman was this? I've seen boys playing, splashing about in a stream. Whose childhood friends were these?  Who am I?	I don't know.
3 Then perhaps I believe in evil after all.

1 Elizabeth, really! He's quite mad!	Scandalous! What would your dear mother say?
2 One-two-three, one-two-three, twirl- two-three...

1 How could all my father's knowledge and skill fail to save her?	It's not ours to decide. All that live must die. It's God's will.

1 Our decision. Together.	Your decision. For us.
2 I give you my soul...	...until our wedding night. When our bodies will join.
3 Victor. I love you,	Elizabeth. My more than sister.

1 Captain, I implore you. The men are frightened and angry. They want your assurance.	They knew the risks when they signed on. I've come too far to turn back now.
2 Then you run the danger of pushing them to mutiny.

1 The entire school heard it. It wasn't something one could miss.	You're a comfort to me, Henry.
2 What now? Writing about it in your journal won't help.	It's a letter to my father.

1 It's the down-and-outs I pity most. Those who can't fend for themselves. They'll be dead by the thousands before this is done. They don't stand a chance out there.	No. They don't.
2 Victor. This place looked like a charnel house. What went on here?

1 Professor Waldman.	Victor, explain yourself.
2 Krempe has a way of provoking my temper.	You have a way of provoking his.  I've been watching you. You seem impatient with your studies.
3 To say the least. I came here to expand my mind, but honest inquiry seems strangled at every turn. All we do is cling to the old knowledge instead of seeking the new.	You disdain accepted wisdom?
4 No, I embrace it... as something to be used or discarded as we advance the boundaries of what is known.

1 We are kindred, you and I. Men of ambition. Let me tell you all that I have lost in such pursuits. I pray my story will come to mean for you all that is capricious and evil in man.	Who are you?
2 My name is Frankenstein...

1 Good night, Alice.	Good night, Brenda.

1 Steve said you were thinking of leaving. True?	Un-hunh.

1 Trouble?	Bad bulb or no power. It's getting a little gloomy in here.

1 Why don't we run? Just run now?	It's over twenty miles to the crossroads. Steve'll be back in an hour. Things will straighten out then. We'll take his Jeep and get help.

1 What the hell?	Where'd you get that stuff?

1 Did anyone ever tell you you're beautiful when you're angry?	I don't believe you...
2 Want to see my trick shot? It's even better.

1 It's gonna be a long summer.	Wait, wait! When I was finding these goodies in the shed. I also found this letter which a camper never sent home. Listen.

1 Mmmmmmmph?	Mmmmmmmph.
2 Best over...	Umhummmmph.
3 Like waves. It's never been likes waves before.	Whassamatta?
4 Gotta pee. You're lying on my bladder.

1 Yeah. I got it on before this --  -- all started.	That's thirty percent.
2 For two lonely nights.

1 You like the car?	I said new, this is an '90.
2 It's hardly been used at all. I got it from a drug dealer who only drove it 5 times in as many years. Swear to God. That's like new.	So do I just follow you?
3 Yeah, follow us.	So let's do it.
4 Vamanos!

1 What's your name?	Jacob.
2 Okay, Jacob, get up and sit your ass down on the bed. Make a wrong move and I'll shoot you in the face.

1 Swear to God, on the Bible, you won't try to escape and you'll get us across the border.	I swear to God I won't try to escape and I'll do my best to get you into Mexico.
2 You best better get it done, Pops.

1 Okay, does anybody here know what's going on?	Yeah, I know what's going on. We got a bunch of fuckin' vampires outside trying to get inside and suck our fuckin' blood! That's it, plain and simple. And I don't wanna hear any bullshit about "I don't believe in vampires" because I don't fuckin' believe in vampires either. But I do believe in my own two fuckin' eyes, and with my two eyes I saw fuckin' vampires! Now, does everybody agree we're dealin' with vampires.

1 There's nothing wrong with this place.	It's a flop house.
2 It's not a flop house. It's basic and simple. That doesn't make it a flop house.	If it doesn't have a pool, we're looking for a new place.

1 What?	In the room. Were you serious, or were you just foolin' around? I'm just bringing it up, 'cause if you really want me to do that for you, I will.
2 Do what?	What you said to me in the room.
3 What did I say?	You asked me if I would --

1 Should I use the last bullets on us?	You use 'em on the first couple of these parasites that try to bite you.

1 Were you giving that pig signals?	What? Are you kidding? I didn't do anything!

1 What did I tell you? What did I tell you? Buy the road map and leave.	What am I supposed to do, Seth? He recognized us.
2 He didn't recognize shit.

1 Yeah, explain it to me. I need an explanation. What's the matter with you?	There's nothing wrong with me, brother. That woman tried to escape and I did what I had to do.
2 No.  That woman wouldn't of said shit if she had a mouthful.	Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong! Once you left, she became a whole different person.
3 Is it me? Is it my fault?	It's not your fault, it's her fault!

1 That's what you think?	That's how you're lookin', Richie.
2 I'm lookin' scared?	That's what you look like.
3 You know what you look like?	No, Richie, what do I look like?
4 You're lookin' green.

1 I don't know if there's any single reason.  But my father was Navy. And he had this old-time recruiting poster in his den.  It showed a girl trying on a sailor's uniform while saying, "Gee, I wish I were a man! I'd join the Navy!"  Was maybe 10 years old when I first saw it, and even then it felt wrong.  Made me mad.  And I don't think a month has gone by that I haven't thought about that poster.  "Gee, I wish I were a man."	I've been accused of that wish.
2 The woman I saw you with...	Just a friend.  We have friends, too, you know.
3 But are there... I mean, how many...	More than you'd guess.  It's just that we don't hold coffee klatches. If more then three of us get together at any one time, the guys think it's some kind of uprising.

1 Pardon the hour, sir.  But you told me to come to you immediately if I felt I was being mistreated in any way.	Didn't take long.

1 Sir.  If tomorrow... I was not under your command... would the inquiry still go forward?	I'm not sure what --
2 Would you have the discretion to end it right then and there?

1 Think I overplayed it?	Congress and the Pentagon share a lot of plumbing.  They'll never know whose leak it is.

1 You know him.	Sounds familiar.
2 It should.  You nominated him for Spec-Recon just three days after you nominated me.	Jordan.  Might we do this over lunch tomorrow?  I do very much want to talk, but now is scarcely --
3 Did you set me up?  Did you set me up just to see me fail?	Absolutely not.

1 Close as I can get, el-tee!	Flea, 'Cool, Cortez, Newman -- take your minis, hit the water.  Go, GO!

1 Automatic five-second deduction, which slips you under the wire. It's called "gender-norming," O'Neil -- standard procedure for all females in physical training courses.  Where you been the last few years?	What "all females"?  If I'm the only --

1 Jordan...	Thank you, Royce.  It was shaping up like such a tough call -- and then you go and make it so goddamn easy. Really, thank you so much.

1 So here we are again.  Staring three years of operational duty in the face.	Look.  It's not like you'd be completely out of reach.  And maybe we could call in a few favors, get you stationed at Norfolk instead of Coronado.  There are ways of dealing with these things -- I mean, if people are so inclined.
2 Which is guy-speak for...	"Yes, Jordan -- I'll wait for you no matter how long."

1 What're you guys doing?  Huh?	Just askin'
2 What, you gonna give it all up for a maple twist?  How dumb you gotta be? That's exactly what they --

1 England went out with a stress fracture.  That puts you in charge, lieutenant.	McCool's that same rank.  We're both j.g.'s.
2 You were commissioned one month earlier, which makes you the senior officer.  Remember.  There are no bad crews -- only bad leaders.

1 Well, who the shit you think you are?  Comin' in here like that?	Your new roommate.

1 You mind?  I'm trying to eat here.	So am I.

1 Animal, you don't think that's true, do you?	Nice guys finish last. First rule of the jungle.
2 Well, I can be tough if I want.

1 What are you doing?	It's the maintenance entrance. Runs along the side of the tunnel. When they repaired it last year I worked on a piece about it.

1 You're a reporter. That's what you always wanted to be, right? I'm happy for you. Really, I am.	Yeah, well...

1 Come on, the broadcast booth is right over here.	How do you know?
2 Our network covers the Ranger games.

1 Four years. Girl, I'm surprised he didn't ask you to marry him.	That's the problem. He did.

1 Three years digging up worms in Chernobyl? How did Mrs. Tatopoulos handle it?	Oh, I'm not married.
2 Really? A girlfriend then?	No. Perhaps I work too much.
3 You mean to tell me that there is no one who holds a special place in your heart?

1 Who are they? Lieutenant, get those people away from there.	They are with me!

1 The radiation is not an anomaly, it's the clue. This creature is far too unique on every level to be some lost dinosaur.	Don't tell me why it's not, tell me what the hell it is.
2 What do we know? It was first sighted off the French Polynesian Pacific. An area that has been exposed to dozens of nuclear tests over the last thirty years.

1 Do I know you?	We've met before.
2 Oh yeah, the insurance guy.

1 Contact the military and get them to send a bomber to blow up this building before these things escape.	How do I do that?
2 555-7600. Tell them it's a code dragonfly. They should get you through.

1 Sir! The pressure.  It's normalizing.	Open.

1 We've got to stop!	We stop we die. Keep holding the thruster down Tommy!
2 You don't hold a thruster down! It's for quick boosts	Like YOU know?

1 ~hex!  Alex, are you oKav?	Yes. Good was done this .....
2 Okay... Let's go, buddy, they can take It from here... I'mo-

1 And note the sucked in gut.	...Sleeves rolled halfway up the biceps...

1 "Go into the cloud! ...	Alex? Where are you going?
2 To see if there's a pub.

1 Commander, as I was saying... In "The Quasar Dilemma", you used the auxiliary of deck b for Gamma override. But online blueprints indicate deck b is independent of the guidance matrix, so we were wondering where the error lies?	It's a television show. Okay? That's all. It's just a bunch of fake sets, and wooden props, do you understand?
2 Yes but, we were wondering-	There IS no quantum flux and there Is no auxiliary... There's no goddamn ship  Do you get it?

1 Go. They're off again.	Up.
2 What?  Up?	Berithium lava coming through. Use the handholds above you.

1 Systems register functional.	All systems are working, Commander. ,~ -cc PINK) -' C -

1 ...The digital conveyor.	Of course... We'll just zap him up with the digital conveyor!

1 How the hell is Fred supposed to project a hologram?	We're doing episode 31, Jason?

1 More to the left... Stay parallel...	Hey, YOU want to drive?

1 Let me try.  Computer?  Computer?...	Only answers to me.
2 But I'm the Commander!	On the show I talk to the computer and repeat what it says. So that's what they built.
3 C'mon, we're wanted up on the command deck.

1 Do we have a replacement Beryllium sphere onboard?	Computer, do we have a replacement Beryllium sphere onboard?

1 Jason?...  I don't think the pig lizard was Gorignak...	What the hell are you talking about?

1 That's it, It's go time.	Don't do it, Tommy. He's not worth it.

1 Right.  Well... Listen, I'm  I'm sorry about that whole... thing.. before. It was kind of a misunderstanding.  I'm sure we can work this out like reasonable people... How's the uh...  ... that going to heal up? God, I hope so, I feel just awful about that.	Deliver the device now or I will destroy your ship.
2 Listen, I'd like to, but frankly.. I'm not even sure where it is, or even...	You have ten seconds.
3 All right. You got it. You win. I'll deliver it now.  Just give me a moment to set it up.

1 Commander?... Where are you... going?	Home.
2 You... You mean Earth?	Yeah. "Earth." Time to get back to "Earth," kids.

1 "Deception..." "Lies."	Well... Sort of...
2 We have become aware of these concepts only recently. In our dealings with Sarris. Often Sarris will say one thing, and do another. Promise us mercy and deliver destruction... It is a concept we are beginning to learn at some great cost.  But if you are saying that any of you could have traits in common with Sarris.

1 Faster Tommy. Get us out of here!	It's as far as it goes!

1 Pedal to the metal Tommy...	Pedal to the metal...

1 Unfortunately, I'll never get the chance.  I'm leaving in an hour for Congress to scream like a violated virgin about my promotion.  Wasting my time, naturally... Look at her teasing those bumpkins.	What does she see in them?

1 The army needs you.	The army can survive without me.
2 Then, I need you.  We all do. Without your victory the men would have no hope at all.	Someday, George, you may need to act for the good of the people no matter what Congress thinks that is.  It may come down to us, or them someday.  You or them.  Cicero was right:  was is 'a time when the laws are silent'.
3 I hope I never have to believe that.	Christ, George, Joseph Reed's been writing letters back to Congress attacking you.  Your own aide!

1 Colonel, sir, Mrs. Washington inquires if you are going to join her for dinner?	Tell Mrs. Washington I am compelled to stay a while longer.

1 I am to take command of Major General Lafayette's division and lead the attack.	Lafayette will not be happy...

1 I was a clerk's apprentice on Saint Croix.  But, then I went to King's College.	To learn to shoot cannon?

1 What's your advice, Alexander?	March on Philadelphia!  Get Joseph Reed, and the pigs in Congress, the speculators, who've grown fat off the war!  Get them all!  Sweep them aside!

1 George, I'm sorry.  We all know the army will acquit Arnold...	Of course the army will acquit him, that's not the point... Arnold is a man and will understand.  What I need to understand is, John, Sam... what is happening here?  Who are those people in there?  The fat ones in silk?
2 They are... friends of Congress.	Is that where our meat and boots and uniforms and muskets went?

1 Any word from Canada?	Spies from Quebec confirm that the British are sending an entire fleet down Lake Champlain...
2 A fleet?

1 However, through my relations with members of his majesty's court, I am a representative of the French government whose deepest desire is to be one people, united with our American brothers in arms to defeat the rapacious armies of King George of England.  Vive la France!  Vive l'Amerique!	We have more officers created by Congress than we know what to do with.
2 But, general, I assure you my motives are sincere.

1 I feel the same, sir.	I will continue with our French allies, concentrating on New York.

1 Well, we must keep in mind the Dower Laws.  One third of everything we have is mine and since our Negroes have been interbreeding, it would be legally impossible to distinguish them.	Martha!  For God's sake!
2 Leave me, now sir, I am tired.	Come out and meet my soldiers. They're good people.

1 Sir, if you don't mind my saying, I don't understand your history at all.  I mean, why would you want to win the war?  You're not after glory, like Benedict...  You're a slave owner, and yet you invite blacks to fight in your army.	You don't believe I can fight from a sense of duty and patriotism?
2 No.  We're all of us after something.  It's easy for me to fight for the common man.  My father could only dream that I would be... a general someday?  And what of my daughter or son?  I know what I'm after.  But now, with all this talk about compromise?  It means the rich will just be more wealthy and the common man has no hope.	I will not betray you, Nathanael.
3 But you are an aristocrat and a slave owner.  Sir.

1 So, you are William's wild young neighbor?  Or should I say, 'brother'; William claims you as a member of his family.  I have heard so many unflattering tales about you, and I understand, that except for you, this 'family' is quite cultivated.	George, I'm sorry.
2 Oh, but you must not mind my talking about you!  In fact, William says my main job here at Belvoir is to civilize you; to make an honest English gentleman out of you.	That's not what I said!  Now, Sally, you're embarrassing me!  Watch out for her, George; she talks refinement, but she has a barbarous soul!

1 And to think I am teaching you to become one of them...	What else should I become?  There's no difference between Virginia and England.  I must be educated if I'm to take my place in society.  My father couldn't afford to send me to England for school -- he made a shambles of our fortunes.  Everyone laughs at me.

1 My daughter, I ask only...	This, this is life indeed!  Life worth preserving, Such life as Juba never felt till now.

1 He's gonna plea-deal his way out. Give up this ace stunt man now one of the West Coast dope kings, if they go easy on the Cat.	Come here, Farrah...

1 What, did you see it work in some movie you got beat up in?	I have to ask you for that key.
2 What, the setup didn't work so you want the key back?	Catlett says if you don't open the locker the deal's off.
3 You serious? This is how you guys do business? I can't believe you aren't dead.

1 You understand I knew Harry was lying, saying this wasn't any good, but holding on to it, man, like you have to break his fingers to get it from him.	That's funny, I was just wondering what I was gonna break of yours to get it away from you.

1 How 'bout I give you to three, then I organize your fuckin' brains all over the wall back there. One...	What, you gonna shoot me now, Bo?
2 In just a second. Two...	I don't believe this.
3 Three.

1 Last night. When he called me over to your office to talk about it.	Chili Palmer showed you my script?
2 Yeah, I was wondering why he should do that.

1 Ray Barboni?	Who is this?
2 Are you the guy they called Ray Bones?	Depends. Who's this?
3 Who is this? I'm the one telling you the way it is, okay, asshole? That's who I am. Now you want your three hundred grand or don't you?	What three hundred grand?
4 The three hundred grand a guy named Leo Devoe scammed off an airline. The three hundred grand Chili Palmer now has in his possession.

1 The man you're steppin' on belongs to me and my partner.	He owes me money.
2 Get in line, bro.	I don't like waiting.
3 Tough shit, bro. This ain't Miami. You want something, talk to me.	Hey, fuckball, I don't need your permission. L.A.'s an open city.

1 I'm looking at you.	I want you to keep looking right here, okay?
2 That's what I'm doing.	You know Dick Allen, Mesa's Casino?
3 Dick Allen's a very dear friend of mine. How far you want to go with this?	We're there, Harry. You signed markers for a hundred and a half, you're over sixty days past due and you haven't told anybody what the problem is.

1 So he comes to L.A...	I don't know about his wanting to meet celebrities, that's something new. But, yeah, he comes to L.A. Then after that, I don't know what happens.

1 She looks familiar.	She's a rock star. Every day, same time, they come down here and have breakfast. He has the egg white omelet; she has the banana pancakes. He sits facing west so he can see his billboard. She faces east so she has an excuse to wear the shades.

1 Is he giving you a check or cash?	Cash. It happens to be waiting right at this moment in a locker at the airport.

1 You owe me the dry cleaner's fifteen grand plus the juice which is what another, uhh...	Twenty seven hundred.
2 Exactly. You either get it from the wife or out of your own pocket, I don't give a fuck. You don't ever hand me a book with a miss in it.

1 At that point, basically, that has to be it.	You're not going to tell me the rest?

1 We call you a taxi.	Lemme get this straight. You aren't responsible for any lost articles like an expensive coat of mine, but you're gonna find Ray Bones' coat or get him a new one? Is that what you're telling me?
2 Mr. Barboni is a good customer.  Works for Jimmy Capp.	I know who he works for. Where's your phone.

1 I got you a copy of the script.	I already read it. Harry left a copy at the house.
2 What do you think?

1 Yeah?	Yeah. There's a girl in it now.
2 Really.

1 Karen! What the fuck are you doing?!	Oh, shit... I'm sorry... I thought that was... I'm so sorry...

1 I hate to say I told you, but I did. I told you don't start nothing with him that time.	You said don't say nothing and I didn't.
2 No, you just broke his fuckin' nose instead.	You gonna start that again? You're just like him, all you got room for in your brain is one fuckin' thing.
3 All I know is he came by the barber shop, all fuckin' undone, wanting to know where you were staying in Vegas. I told him I don't know. I still don't.	How'd he know I was in Vegas? You tell him?
4 He already knew it.	Yeah, well, I'm in L.A. now.
5 Whatta you doing out there?	I'm going into the movie business.
6 What're you talking about? You wanna be a movie star?	I'm thinking about producing.
7 How you gonna do that? You don't know shit about making movies.	I don't think the producer has to do much, outside of maybe knowing a writer.
8 Hey, Chil? I think you're fulla shit.

1 So this means you've reconsidered our deal on Mr. Lovejoy?	No. But now that you mention it, I did talk to a handsome executive at Paramount the other day... who just happened to get his hands on the script.
2 Yeah, what'd he have to say?	He said if Martin's interested, I could get a half a million for it easy. But don't worry, Harry, I'm still giving you until Friday.
3 How honorable of you.

1 Harry -	Man's in town two days, thinks he's David O. fucking Selznick.

1 A passenger liner, north island. Over.	What is the vessel name, registry, and present position? Over.
2 Passenger vessel "Chimera." I will spell: charlie hotel india mary echo romeo alpha. No registry information is available at this time. I have determined to the best of my ability that the vessel has been abandoned on the high seas at position one seven four west, five seven north at...  Two zero one four hours zulu time. Over.	Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. Please advise your salvage authority pending registry check. Over.
3 Roger, North Island. Arctic Warrior over and out.

1 Are you crazy? Do you realize we got ourselves a ship? We own a ship, Dodge.	Yeah, a ship that's supposed to have been lost at sea fifty years ago. You don't think that's just a little freaky?

1 The turbine blew.	Lemme see, was that before or after the oil fire?

1 Ready?	Bring it on, dude.

1 One guy isn't gonna be so stupid.	Maybe he isn't alone.

1 What the hell would a freighter be doing up here? It's way out of the lanes. There's not a port for 800 miles.	Smugglers maybe.

1 Didn't happen yesterday, I'll tell you that. Torn parts rusted bad as the rest of the boat.	Then it happened before they scuttled her.

1 What if that fucker finds it before we're ready to go?	We'll stand a watch. Four on, eight off. Low man first.

1 There's no way we're gonna hide a few thousand pounds of gold from the Coastguard here. Besides, it'll be safer where it is.	With all due respect, skipper.  Part of that up there's mine. I'd kinda like to have a little say in what happens to it.

1 You're late.	Sorry.
2 Don't fall asleep.	Right.

1 Coffee.	You're a pal.

1 What'd you find up there?	Some charts. A crew manifest.  Looks like her last voyage was January 1953. The question is where the hell's she been since.
2 She was sailing up north, right?	Her destination was Halifax, yeah.
3 Well, suppose she got a little further north than she should have.  Got stuck in the ice. The passengers and crew evacuated. She froze into the ice pack, which moved further north, where it froze in solid. They write it off. Fifty years later, the whole global warming thing happens. The ice melts, she gets loose and floats around til somebody runs into her.

1 Murphy to Epps.	Epps.
2 You just shoot at something?	Yeah. Just a bird. Just a stupid bird.

1 It's a good bet they'll be asking a lot of questions when they get here too.	Let 'em ask. This ship's legally ours now.

1 Nope.	He's not on deck and I can't raise him on the radio.

1 Not bad for dragging a leaky tub half way to Russia.	He'll sell the scrap for three times what he paid.
2 I must be in the wrong business.	You got that right.
3 Better than "making hamburger for Mickey D."

1 Some classy tub in it's day, huh?	Yeah.

1 I don't know.	Let's just take it easy here, alright? Nobody's gonna kill anybody.
2 Supposing he wants to get bad with us?

1 We're not gonna be able to pump it!	Alright. Everybody grab your gear! This' is where we get off!

1 As I said, what seems to be the trouble?	Didn't you hear me, grandpa? Or you got your hearing aid turned down?
2 I heard you. But I'm choosing to ignore you. Epps, let's go.

1 It's nothing -- it's just some hormonal thing... don't worry about it...	I've got some important news to tell you, but it can wait till later if you're not feeling...
2 What?	Well... as you know, Maxine and I have been seeing a lot of each other, and we decided it might be a good idea for all of us if she came back here to live at the end of the Summer, just so we can all get to know each other and to make sure this is what we want.

1 I-I honestly never intended for this to happen...	Please tell me it isn't that teenager!
2 Enid and I were just friends. You know... we feel comfortable around each other... she really likes my old records and...	I can't believe this! I thought at the very least a guy like you would never pull this kind of shit on me!

1 Well hello there, young employee of the Sidewinder.	Look, I already told you I'm not going to give you a ride.
2 What can you tell me, young man, about the various flavors of "frozen yogurt"?	Look, I'll be done in a minute. Just wait outside.
3 I'm afraid I don't understand. I simply wish to know --

1 Hi... what's up?	Can I come in?

1 Since when is she an "actress"?	I know, she needs to die immediately.

1 Who can forget this great hit from the 50's?	I feel as though I've stepped into a time warp!

1 Look, that's back when I hated you.	I remember every minute of that party.
2 There's my dad with Joanie.	I can never keep them all straight - was she the super-bitch?
3 No, she was the second wife. The third one was the super-bitch - Maxine.  There! Look at her!

1 What's going on now? What's he doing?	Oh my god, he just ordered a giant glass of milk!

1 That was truly pathetic.	I know... I still can't get over that his name was "Seymour."

1 I'll bet he never jerks off...	Yeah, he's beyond human stuff like that.
2 Should we leave a note?

1 That guy is totally amazing.	He does that every single day.

1 I think one of us should fuck Josh...	Go ahead...
2 No, really...	God, you're really obsessed...
3 I am not -- I just think it'd be funny to see what he'd do...	I thought we decided that Josh was way too cool to be interested in sex, and that he's the only decent person left in the world and we would never want to bring him down to our level and all that...
4 Yeah, but maybe one of us should at least try...	No matter what happened it would be a big disaster... Let's just try and keep everything the way it is.

1 Hi.	Oh, hi... I almost didn't recognize you -- I think I need to get glasses; you're all blurry!
2 You're lucky then, you can't see the veins on that guy's biceps.	Actually, he's a really nice guy.

1 A what?	A mongoose... they eat snakes... you never heard of a mongoose?  That's a classic piece of vintage taxidermy. Nobody alive today knows how to do work like that.
2 How much is this?	Umm... That's not officially for sale... I might have to hang onto that for the time being.

1 You never paid me for that tape with the Indian dance routine.	I did too!
2 Tsk! You Jews are so clever with money...	Fuck you, you stupid redneck hick!

1 Oops! I dropped it!	NO!!!
2 Hey, I was only kidding!

1 Look at this -- "Lollipop Lolitas" - isn't child pornography totally illegal?	These are older women just dressed up to look young... I think.

1 Actually, I was a whole lot more interested in the Cook's phenomenon when I was about your age. I've kind of lost interest since I've been working for them...	You work at Cook's Chicken?
2 For nineteen years...	What are you, a fry cook or something?
3 Nothing so glamorous... actually, I'm an assistant manager at their corporate headquarters.	Jesus, I'd go nuts if I had to work in an office all day.
4 Hey, I get good benefits, a good early retirement plan, nobody ever bothers me...	Yeah, but still...
5 I make enough money to eat and buy old records... what more do I want?

1 Where have you been? I've been looking all over for you... I've been wandering the streets day and night trying to find you...	Really?
2 No, actually Joe told me you were here... so how come you never call me anymore?	I know, I'm sorry... I-I've been really busy...
3 Yeah, I'll bet! So, how's it going with what's-her-name? Dana?	Oh... pretty well, surprisingly... you know...
4 So, what kind of stuff do you guys do together? Is she into old records and stuff?	Sort of... she doesn't dislike any of that stuff... she's trying, anyway... actually, we're supposed to go antique shopping for her apartment this afternoon...
5 Sounds good...

1 You know what my number one fantasy used to be?	What?
2 I used to think about one day not telling anybody and just taking off and going to some random place... Do you ever think about stuff like that?	I guess I probably used to when I was your age.
3 It would have to be some totally average day when nobody was expecting it, and I'd just disappear and they'd never see me again.	Sounds like a healthy way to deal with your problems.
4 You know what we should do? Let's go get in your car right now and just take off! We could just drive away and find some new place and start a whole new life... fuck everybody!	I don't think I'm in any condition to drive.
5 I'll drive, then -- we'll go out in a blaze of glory!	So where would we go?
6 Who cares? Let's just go... what's stopping us?	I dunno, I...
7 I'm serious! I'm just so sick of everybody! Why can't I just do whatever I want?	What do you want?
8 What do you want?	I-I-I...
9 What's the matter with you, Seymour? Don't you like me? Be a man for once in your life!

1 Did you remember to pay the phone bill?	Yeah.
2 Call me sometime.

1 He sees this chaos, he'll replace you all.	He'll replace you, too- that's all you really care about.
2 You think so? Fine.  It's best you get out. Go. Tell all your people to go, run home where they'll be safe under the covers and when the bridge is built and the railroad is done, they can tell their women that out of all the thousands who worked here, they were the only ones to flee- 

1 Lovely sound- they seem happy.	Don't they, though?
2 So work must be going well?

1 This sham? Ridiculous. Who needs it? It's only being built to control the ivory trade, make men richer.	Then why do you stay?
2 Who else would hire me?  Beat you to it, didn't I?  Oh yes, almost forgot- brought you a little welcoming gift. 

1 Very good indeed.	We have hunted since childhood.
2 All right- you'll spend your nights inside.  You'll have plenty of ammunition. You're totally protected, you have really nothing to fear.	That is correct.  Nothing.

1 You said "of course" you'd need the donkey. Why "of course"?	We know three things about man-eaters. First, they always return to where they've attacked before. Second, they're always old- they can't catch other animals so they turn to us. And third, they're always alone- they've been cast out by their pride because they can't keep up.

1 What a good week.	You mean nobody died?
2 We all worked together. Worthy deeds were accomplished. I liked the labor.  My mother insisted on piano lessons- broke the dear woman's heart when I turned out to be tone deaf- but she still was always at me about being careful with my hands.  I like the blood, is that strange?

1 In my town, when I was little, there was a brute, a bully who terrorized the place.  But he was not the problem. He had a brother who was worse than he. But the brother was not the problem.  One or the other of them was usually in jail. The problem came when they were both free togther. The two became different from either alone.  Alone they were only brutes. Together they became lethal, together they killed.	What happened to them?
2 I got big. 

1 I am also liaison between these two.	Clearly you don't agree about building the railroad?

1 Where is it?	Underneath.  Somewhere.

1 We'll be very sorry to lose you.  Perhaps I could take you to lunch today?	Actually, I'm not eating lunch today.  I have an appointment.  In fact, I'd better go.

1 This is my address and telephone number. Will you call me?	Certainly.
2 Egon, I'd rather you didn't mention any of this to Peter if you don't mind.	I won't.
3 Thank you.

1 I wish I could stay.  I feel personally responsible for you being here.	You are personally responsible.  If I can get conjugal rights, will you visit me at Sing Sing?
2 Please don't say that.  You won't go to prison.	Don't worry about me.  I'm like a cat.
3 You mean you cough up hairballs all over the rug?	I'm El Gato.  I always land on my feet.
4 Good luck.	Thanks.

1 Are you all squeaky clean now?	Yes, I'm very clean.  Did they find anything at my apartment?

1 I think we hit the honeypot, boys.  There's something brewing under the street.	Peter, do you think maybe I have some genetic problem or something that makes me vulnerable to these supernatural things.

1 Oh migod!  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to do that.  It was an accident.	What are you doing up here?
2 I was trying to get that smelly green thing. The guys asked me to help out.  I'm like the fifth Ghostbuster.	Why would you want to be a Ghostbuster if you're already an accountant?
3 Oh, no, it's just if one of the guys calls in sick or gets hurt.

1 We don't go around altering valuable paintings, Dr. Venkman.	Well, I'd make an exception in this case if I were you.

1 You've got to do something!	Who are they?
2 They're the Scoleri Brothers.  I tried them for murder.  They were electrocuted up at Ossining in '48.  Now they want to kill me.	Maybe they just want to appeal.

1 Hi, welcome back to the 'World of the Psychic,' I'm Peter Venkman and I'm chatting with my guest, author, lecturer and of course, psychic, Milton Anglund.  Milt, your new book is called The End of the World.  Isn't that kind of like writing about gum disease.  Yes, it could happen, but do you think anybody wants to read a book about it?	Well, I think it's important for people to know that the world is in danger.
2 Okay, so can you tell us when it's going to happen or do we have to buy the book?	I predict that the world will end at the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve.
3 This year?  That's cutting it a little close, isn't it?  I mean, just from a sales point of view, the book just came out, right?  So you're not even looking at the paperback release for maybe a year.  And it's going to be at least another year after that if the thing has movie-of-the-week or mini-series potential. You would have been better off predicting 1992 or even '94 just to be safe.	This is not just some money-making scheme!  I didn't just make up the date.  I have a strong psychic belief that the world will end on New Year's Eve.
4 Well, for your sake, I hope you're right.  But I think my other guest may disagree with you. Elaine, you had another date in mind?

1 That's it?  "I'll be back?"	It's a rough translation from the Moldavian.

1 Hey, I didn't imagine it.  There must have been ten thousand gallons of it down there.	It may be ebbing and flowing from some tidal source.

1 Is the line sinking?	No, the slime is rising.

1 I'm Ray --	I'm Peter --

1 Don't tell me, let me guess.  All-you-can-eat barbecue rib night at the Sizzler?	We're going down into the sewer system to see if we can trace the source of the psycho-reactive slime flow.  We thought you might want to come along.
2 Darn it!  I wish I'd known you were going. I'm stuck with these damn dinner reservations.

1 I think she looks pretty good here, don't you?	Yeah, and a lot easier to get to than that island.

1 Are you telling me how to drive?	No, I just thought --
2 Well don't think!

1 Kind of makes you wonder, doesn't it?	Wonder what?
2 If she's naked under that toga.  She's French, you know.

1 Okay.  Just give me a second here.  I have to leave now but if you've got some time I'd like you to come back this evening and do some more work with me.	Eight o'clock?
2 I was just going to say "eight."  You're fantastic!

1 No, just that one word -- Zuul -- but I have no idea what it means.	Spengler,  see if you can find the word "Zuul" in any of the literature.  I'll take Miss Barrett home and check out her apartment.

1 He is a very close friend.  Do you have some explanation of what happened in my apartment?	Yes, but I have to tell you in private at a fine restaurant.
2 Can't you tell me now?	I'll cancel the reservation,  I found the name "Zuul" in ...  The Roylance Guide to Secret Societies and Sects.  I don't suppose you've  read it.
3 You must have gotten the last copy.	Well, the name Zuul refers to a demi-god worshipped around 6000 B.C. by the ... What's that say?
4 Hittites,  the Mesopotamians and the Sumerians.  "Zuul was the Minion of Gozer."	"Gozer" -- he was very big in the Sumerian religion.  One of their gods.
5 What's he doing in my refrigerator.	I'm checking on that.  I think we should meet Thursday night at nine to talk about it.
6 I don't think so.  I'm busy Thursday night.	You think I enjoy giving up my evenings to spend time with clients?  I'm making an exception because I respect you as an artist and as a dresser.
7 All right.  Since you put it that way.	I'll pick you up at your place.  I'll bring along the Roylance Guide -- we can read after we eat.
8 I've got to go now.

1 Hello, I'm Roger Delacorte - the Head Librarian.  Are you the men from the University?	Yes.  I'm Dr. Venkman and this is Dr. Stantz.
2 Thank you for coming.  I'd appreciate it if we could take care of this quickly and quietly.	One thing at a time.  We don't even know what it is yet.

1 Can I help you?	I'm Walter Peck.  I represent the Environmental Protection Agency, Third District.
2 Great!  How's it going?	Are you Peter Venkman?
3 Yes, I'm Doctor Venkman.

1 Hey!  I'm getting a little tired of this.	You volunteered, didn't you?  Aren't we paying you for this?
2 Yeah, but I didn't know you were going to give me electric shocks.  What are you trying to prove?	I'm studying the effect of negative reinforcement on ESP ability.
3 I'll tell you the effect!  It pisses me off!	Then my theory was correct.

1 Wait!  Wait!  There's something I forgot to tell you.	What?
2 Don't cross the beams.	Why not?
3 Trust me.  It will be bad.	What do you mean "bad?"
4 It's hard to explain, but try to imagine all life as you know it stopping instantaneously and finding yourself confined forever in another dimension.

1 I just realized something.  We've never had a completely successful test with any of the equipment.	I blame myself.

1 Spengler and I have charted every psychic occurrence in the Tri-State area for the past two years.  The graph we came up with definitely points to something big.	Ray, as your friend I have to tell you I think you've really gone around the bend on this ghost stuff.  You've been running your ass off for two years checking out every schizo in the Five Boroughs who thinks he's had an experience.  And what have you seen?
2 What do you mean by "seen?"	Looked at with your eyes.
3 Well, I was at an unexplained multiple high-altitude rockfall once.	Uh-huh.  I've heard about the rockfall, Ray. I think you've been spending too much time with Spengler.

1 Everybody can relax.  I found the car.  How do you like it?	Do you think it's wide enough?  How much?
2 Fourteen hundred.

1 I guess they don't build them like they used to, huh?	No!  Nobody ever built them like this!  The architect was either an authentic whacko or a certified genius.  The whole building is like a huge antenna for pulling in and concentrating psychokinetic energy.
2 Who was the architect?	He's listed on the blueprints as I. Shandor.

1 What's he talking about?  Choose what?	What do you mean "choose?"  We don't understand.

1 It's disgusting!  Animals!  I had to come here under armed guard.  Slaves -- get this junk out of my sight.	Commodus is heaving out every thing that belonged to our father.  Except that he can't heave out his ghost.

1 Welcome back from your great triumph Narcissus Meridas.  My father sends his heart felt praise.  Sadly, Marcus is in dark humors -- nothing to worry about, but he needs rest. Likely just the weather.	Respectfully Caesar, Quintus and I must report.
2 Of course, but not now.  However, if he continues to be unwell, you may report to me.

1 The army is a problem.  They love you.  You have led them from victory to victory in the name of Rome and they love you.  And after all, you're just a hothead acting from a misguided sense of loyalty -- who could fault you for that?  Thus have I reached a compromise with the Senate over your fate: instead of executing you, I'm sending you to Rome where you will be tried...	On what charge?

1 Marcus Aurelius has died.	He left us at dawn.

1 "Caesar Commodus discovering his lineage converges with the Demigod, Hercules, has determined to display his magnificence before his beloved citizens."  The Emperor's going to fight in the arena.  I'm supposed to write this for tomorrow's edition.	Commodus... he's a gladiator... is he mad?

1 Who are you?  Narcissus The Good?  I have heard of Narcissus Meridas. That's who I hear you are.	You're hearing about somebody else.
2 How did you get condemned to the arena without a trial?	When the Senate and the Emperor agree miracles can happen.
3 Would you support the Senate if they would give you a trial?  You'd have to give me your word.	I need to give you my word when yours is worth nothing?
4 You're a citizen and a soldier.  Not a gladiator.	You don't know how wrong you are.

1 "If you consider yourself to be only one thread of many in the tunic, then it is fitting for you to be like the rest of men, just as the thread has no desire to be any better than the other threads. But..."	"But what if I wish to be purple?"

1 Serious stuff...	Centurions on both sides of the river are convinced the Germans will try one last offensive.  They've got nothing to lose and it's so very like them.

1 This is our oil from our estates?	I've been overseeing production myself for the past three years, you'll be surprised at how wonderful our oil has become.

1 Sorry but I have to get at least one fight out of you otherwise I won't even get back the cost of the bribe I had to pay the arena slaves to get you here.  I know what you're trying to do:  kill yourself and trust in the Roman tradition of justice that the emperor will let your family survive and keep their lands.  The only thing you have accomplishes is to prove you're a very important individual.  You make me feel good about my investment!  And that puking pig Jerses -- he won't even discuss you.  Both of you have clamped mouths!  But I love all my fighters -- I'll find out about your family.  And about you.  That I promise.	I refuse to be your slave.  I refuse --
2 -- to fight?  We'll see...

1 Tell me honestly, since this may be our last earthly meeting:  if this were a fair fight where would you put your money?	On you!  Of course!  You are my bravest fighter -- the best fighter I have ever seen!
2 Such nobility from such an ignoble mouth.  Take my advice and make that bet.	Oh, shit.  Take your time!  Don't get suckered!  This man is a murderer!  In his career he's killed over a thousand gladiators.  Please, just take the fall!

1 Benjamin -- do you dislike me for some reason?	No -- why should I?
2 I don't know.

1 Benjamin --	Let's get out of here, Elaine. Let's go somewhere else.
2 Benjamin -- do they know you?	Of course not.

1 No -- don't cry --	GET OUT!
2 Don't cry. 	Get out of here.

1 She said she was having a drink in the hotel with a friend. You waited for her in the parking lot and told her she was too drunk to drive home and that you would get her a room for the night.	Then what?
2 Then you took her upstairs and you raped her.	Elaine -- that is not what happened.

1 You won't?	I don't know.
2 But you might.	I might.
3 Is that so? You might marry me?	Yes.
4 When?	I don't know.
5 How about tomorrow? I don't mean to be pushy but --	I don't know. I don't know what's happening.
6 You mean you're confused?

1 Benjamin?	What?

1 Oh -- hello, Mr. McCleery.	Who screamed?
2 It's all right, Mr. McCleery.	Screaming isn't all right. Not in my house it isn't.
3 It was just a visitor. But it's all right now.

1 Hello.	Mrs. Robinson -- I don't quite know how to put this --
2 Benjamin?	Look -- I was thinking about that time after the party --
3 Where are you?	-- and I was wondering if I could buy you a drink or something --
4 Where are you?	Uh -- The Taft Hotel.
5 Did you get a room?	No. Now I know it's pretty late and if you'd rather --
6 Give me an hour.	What?
7 I'll be there in an hour.

1 Benjamin, I want to ask you something.	What?
2 Will you take me home?	What?
3 My husband took the car. Will you drive me home?

1 What do you think of me?	What do you mean?
2 You've known me nearly all of your life. You must have formed some opinion.	Well -- I've always thought that you were a very -- nice -- person.
3 Did you know I was an alcoholic?	What?
4 Did you know that?	Look -- I think I should be going --
5 Sit down, Benjamin.	Mrs. Robinson -- if you don't mind my saying so -- this conversation is getting a little strange. Now I'm sure that Mr. Robinson will be here any minute and --
6 No.	What?
7 My husband will be back quite late.

1 Don't be nervous.	Get away from that door.
2 I want to say something first.	Jesus Christ!
3 Benjamin -- I want you to know I'm available to you. If you won't sleep with me this time --	Oh my God.
4 If you won't sleep with me this time, Benjamin, I want you to know you can call me up any time you want and we'll make some kind of arrangement.	Let me out!
5 Do you understand what I said?	Yes. Yes. Let me out!
6 Because I find you very attractive and any time --

1 I got a single room.	That's fine.
2 But there's one thing. The desk clerk seemed to be a little bit suspicious. I mean -- I don't know what their policy is -- but --	Well -- do you want to go up first?
3 Yes -- I think that would be good.	I'll be up in five minutes.
4 Well -- goodbye then --	Benjamin.
5 Yes?	Isn't there something you want to tell me?
6 To tell you?	Yes.
7 Well -- I want you to know how much I appreciate this -- really --	The number.
8 What?	The room number, Benjamin. I think you ought to tell me that.
9 Oh? You're absolutely right. Absolutely. It's 512.	Thank you.
10 You're welcome. Well -- I'll see you later, Mrs. Robinson.

1 Do you want to hear it or not?	Yes. But you might try and spice it up with a little originality.
2 I got up. I ate breakfast and went shopping. During the afternoon I read a novel.	What one.
3 What?	What novel did you read.
4 I don't remember.

1 I wish you'd tell me.	There's nothing to tell.
2 Well why is she a big taboo subject all of a sudden?

1 Drive down the block.	Mrs. Robinson -- I have a date with Elaine. We're going for a drive.
2 Do exactly what I say.

1 Say hello to Mrs. Robinson, Benjamin.	Hello, Mrs. Robinson.

1 They don't know?	No -- they don't.
2 Well -- when did you decide all this?	About an hour ago.

1 Here. It looks like you need a refill.	Oh no.
2 What?	I've got to go.
3 Is anything wrong? You look a little shaken up.	No. No -- I'm just -- I'm just a little worried about my future. I'm a little upset about my future.

1 Can you see me now?	Yes, I can.

1 I'm having luck for the first time in my life.	Your bank, Mr. Kringelein.

1 Like dancing?	Not with strangers.

1 Please do not be frightened, Madam.	What do you want here?
2 Nothing -- only to be here.	Why do you hide in my room?
3 But surely you must know -- because I love you.	Because you love me -- you love me?

1 You may keep the pearls -- I don't want them any more -- I'll make you a present of them.	I don't want them now.
2 I'll not denounce you.	I know.
3 So --	Yesterday I was a thief -- but now, --
4 But now, you must go... I give you the pearls. But now you must go ---	I wanted money desperately -- Can you understand? -- That's why I wanted the pearls. I was threatened -- I was desperately in need of a certain big sum of money. I've been following you -- I've admired you. But I have forced myself not to think about you -- Last night, at last, I managed to came into your room and -- and now.
5 And now?	I couldn't go through with it.  Remarkable.

1 What's the matter, Mr. Kringelein?	General Director Preysing!  Baron, when I was sixteen years old, I started as an office boy in that man's factory --
2 Then you know him?	Do I know him -- I know him through and through.

1 That was my last.	You've lost everything?
2 I've no luck.	Pardon me, Baron. Permit me again... 

1 Oh, let the poor devil alone.	I did not ask your advice.

1 The night clerk has already gone -- you are late.	Man -- I was at the clinic the whole night -- there are no words to describe what my wife suffered.
2 And the child isn't coming?	No -- no -- not yet. Well, I mustn't let it interfere with my duty. Any news here?
3 News? Yes -- killing in number one- sixty-four.	What? -- Who? -- Whom?
4 The big manufacturer killed Baron von Gaigern.	Good heavens. What for?
5 I don't know.	Man -- that's terrible. He was a nice fellow -- I am sorry about him.
6 It seems that he was a thief and an imposter.	I don't believe it -- he was a real gentleman. I know people... I'm so tired I can hardly see out of my eyes. No sleep for two nights and so many duties and now this killing in the hotel -- that means a lot of work. But it's too bad about the Baron, you always felt better when he came along -- always friendly -- such an agreeable fellow.
7 Most imposters are --

1 Well, Mr. Kringelein, are you getting what you're looking for?	What, Doctor?
2 A masculine paradise -- drink, the ladies, dancing...	I had a very good opportunity, a young lady asked me to dance -- I ought to be able to dance, it seems to be very important.
3 You must learn as quickly as your time allows -- Believe me Mr. Kringelein, a man who isn't with a woman is a dead man.	Haven't you anyone -- Haven't you anybody -- you -- I mean -- Are you all alone in the world.
4 I'm always alone -- I have been everything.	Everything?
5 I was sent as a military surgeon to South Africa. Stinking climate. Taken prisoner. Home on parole not to fight. I was a surgeon in the Great War till the end. Grenade in the face. Carried diphtheria bacilli in the wound until 1920. Isolated two years.  I've been everything.

1 Good evening, Mr. Kringelein -- Where's the Baron?	I'm waiting for him here. The Baron and I have been together all day. A hundred miles an hour -- in a motor car -- and in an aeroplane -- It was marvelous --
2 Mr. Kringelein -- How you have changed, you look so nice.	Oh, thank you, Miss Flaemm. Oh, please, Miss Flaemm -- Permit me, Miss Flaemm, won't you have something sweet -- a Louisiana flip.  A Louisiana flip.
3 No - absinthe.	Yes -- that --

1 What...! --	I'm the stenographer.
2 Then you will please wait outside.

1 Don't misunderstand me. I'm a married man -- with grownup daughters. Uh --	Moreover -- Do you mind if I smoke?  I went to Florence once, too.
2 With the same friend?

1 Come here. 	Here, hold up!

1 Tentative my foot -- a month before this your old father-in-law came very privately and scratched at my door.	Scratched --  We did not take the initiative.
2 Of course you took the initiative.

1 Mr. Preysing has too scrupulous a regard for certainties...	You've talked enough today, you're hoarse now.

1 Oh, come, Madam -- please come. 	All right, Suzette -- quickly -- hurry.

1 Come along, oh, Madam, come along. The train will be going.	Wait a minute. I've got to ask myself.

1 Mr. Kringelein will be a good friend and not accept your invitation to dance.	I could not think of not accepting.
2 You say that you are employed by us in Fredersdorf, and here you are in Berlin, indulging in diversions which ill befit your position and which are very much beyond your means -- Quite extraordinary, Mr. Kringelein, I think we will look into your books.

1 What's the use of asking, Gru -- he is at the train -- He will be there.	The troupe, the scenery, everything -- all on board, waiting. You have a rehearsal in Vienna tomorrow morning. Come, Madam, are you mad?

1 How'd you figure you were gonna get away with that?	I'm not getting away with anything, Bobo.
2 You're fuckin right you're not. How much did your pals cut you in for on that nag, huh? Or did they give you the same kind of screwing you gave me?	I was down on that horse, Bobo. Not as much as I should have been, but there was a lot of action on those--

1 Your kid's in the back here. He's crying.	Roy? He's always crying.
2 The kids beat him up, because his home life is, uh, different.	I like you, too.

1 Want a look?	Oh, Henry, no, that's just boring.

1 Yes, yes, but that's --	My son will be all right. If he isn't, I'll have you killed.

1 Sounds like a good Idea.	I don't know offhand what your best year's been, we can look it up. The idea is, we'll top it by fifteen percent.

1 I like those.	You do not! Roy Dillon? Cornball clown pictures? Commission salesman? It's all a front, isn't it? You're on the grift, I know you are. You're working some angle, and don't tell me you're not because I wrote the book!
2 You're one to talk. Still running playback money for the mob.	That's me. That's who I am. You were never cut out for the rackets, Roy, and if you --
3 How come?

1 What's that?	Four grand. For the hospital. Is that enough?
2 Roy, I don't want money from you.	I pay my debts.
3 You do?

1 I need this, Roy. I can't run without money, and if I can't run I'm dead.	You must have some money.
2 Just a few bucks.	And Myra's stuff?
3 Her credit cards. How far am I gonna get with that?	Far enough. Maybe up to San Francisco. Or St. Louis, someplace new. Start over.
4 At what?	You're smart, Lilly, and you're good-looking. You won't have any trouble finding a job.
5 A job? I've never had a legit job in my life!	Well, you're gonna start, if you hope to live through this. A square job and a quiet life. You start showing up at the track or the hot spots and Bobo's boys will be all over you.
6 Roy, I know what to do with myself! It's a big world out there.	Not any more. Lilly, listen, I'm giving you good advice. I'm following it myself.
7 What?	I thought it over, and you were right. You wanted me out of the rackets, and now --
8 Roy, that's fine, but I don't have time for this. Bobo --	I thought you'd be happy for me. After all, you --
9 Bobo isn't after you! Bobo's after me, and he's goddamn good! But so am I. I'm a survivor, Roy. I survive.	I know you do, so that's why --
10 And to survive, my way, I need money. Bobo knows about the stash in the car, so I didn't dare touch it, not if Lilly Dillon's dead. So that leaves this.	No.

1 There's nothing more to talk about.	I have to have that money, Roy. What do I have to do to get it?

1 That isn't granite. If that fell on me, it wouldn't hurt at all.	Are you sure?
2 Let's find out.

1 Big spender.	You ain't seen nothin.

1 Yeah?	Open your door.
2 What?  What for?	Open it and find out.

1 I realize this is a shock.	Well, mostly, I don't believe it.
2 That's natural.	No. I mean, I don't believe it. Lilly is not a suicide. I know my mother, nothing would make her check out.
3 I'm sorry, it was her all right. Her gun, even.	Gun?
4 I grant you, it's a little odd, shoot yourself with a gun with a silencer on it, but it was hers, all right. It really is your mother, Mister Dillon.	It may be Lilly, but it isn't suicide.
5 Do you have any particular reason to say that?	My mother... Well, I guess it doesn't matter now. She worked for gamblers. She always knew they might turn on her some day.
6 A hit, you mean. Honestly, it doesn't have that feel to it, but I'll certainly consider the possibility. Thank you for telling me.

1 Where, judging by the looks of the finger and palm prints, she struggles to open the window before banging on it like hell.	Unable to escape, she turns and attacks the killer, but doesn't connect.
2 No blood on the knife.

1 I'll be damned.	Do I know you?

1 Nothing's changed since yesterday, or last week, or last month... the answer's still "no."	You're so predictable.

1 Now you're joking, right?	Afraid not.  You can pick your friends, but you can't pick your family.

1 You really think Eddie killed her?	You saw that Michael Meyers display.  You've got to be pretty twisted to come up with something like that.
2 I guess.  It's just hard to believe.

1 Who?	Michael Meyers.
2 The serial killer?	He's my brother.

1 What's this?	You say, "The key to my heart," and I'm gonna hurl.

1 Whatever happened to women in back?	Reality check, dillweed.  This is 1995.

1 Mom, I want to go to the fair ...	You can't expect us to stay here --

1 What should I do?	Lock the doors and call your husband. Get your family as far away from Haddonfield as possible.
2 God ... this can't be true.	Mrs. Strode, Michael Myers is here to kill his family.  And he won't stop until you are all destroyed.  I only thank God that I found you before he did.

1 Runes were a kind of early alphabet that originated in Northern Europe thousands of years ago.  They were symbols -- carved out of stone or pieces of wood.  Of all the runes, Thorn had the most negative influence. Cults used them in blood rituals to portend future events and invoke magic.	Black magic ...  'In ancient times, Thorn was believed to cause sickness, famine and death. Translated literally, it was the name of a demon spirit that delivered human sacrifices ... on the Celtic celebration of Samhain.'
2 Halloween.	'When applied directly to another person, Thorn could be used to call upon them confusion and destruction -- to literally visit them with the Devil.'

1 But with Rogers and his house of hacks gone, you'd make the rules.  Just think it over.	Please try to understand, Terence. I've already made up my mind.

1 You've created a monster.	Amazing, isn't it?  I even taught him to drive.

1 Home.	You know what gets me?

1 Excuse me.	One of them is the doctor, whose weapons are compassion, unselfishness, peacefulness-- maudlin concern.
2 Huh.	He and his love are like a retiarius.  Do you know what a retiarius is?
3 He's a kind of gladiator who fights with a knife and a net and doesn't wear anything but a jockstrap.	How do you know that?
4 You told me.	When?
5 When we were up in the tree so long--with the bats.	Oh.  I'd forgotten.
6 Fourteen times you told me.  I counted.	Really?
7 You'd get this funny look in your eyes, and I'd say to myself, "Oh, Jesus--he's going to tell me what a retiarius is again."	Sorry.

1 Insurance!	You actually sold insurance!

1 Yes, wife, it is.  Come here, boy.  Your father is home.	Sir?

1 What's this?	Nothing.
2 That's a rifle you have?	No.
3 Of course it is.  Is it loaded?	No.
4 Open the bolt!

1 What's that all about?	We thought a doctor might help.
2 Your old beau?	We thought it was an emergency.
3 I don't want that chancre mechanic in here.	He's a very decent man, Harold.
4 We all are.	Shouldn't you lie down?
5 When I'm dead--  or fucking.	Paul said you were awfully sick.
6 I was, I was.  It never lasts long.

1 I'm going to touch your shoulders very gently now.  You mustn't scream.  So tense, so tense.	You shouldn't have talked to Norbert that way.
2 You're thinking with your brain instead of your body.  That's why you're so tense!  Forget Norbert. Relax.  It's body time.	I have a brain.
3 We all do.  But now it's body time. Relax.  Ideally, the body of a woman should feel like a hot water bottle filled with Devonshire cream. You feel like a paper bag crammed with curtain rods.  Think of your muscles one by one.  Let them go slack.  Relax.  Let the brain go blank.  Relax.  That's the idea-- that's my girl.  Now the small of the back.  Let those knots over those kidneys unsnarl.

1 Well--what have we here?  A family.	Almost a Christmas scene.
2 Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.	Just one favor.
3 Money?  There's plenty of that. Mildred got the brewery.  You'll probably get the baseball team.	I want you to tell me that you loved me once.

1 Help your mother find the bullet.	There it is.  Give it to me.

1 I mean--I can't leave you here. You'll have to go.  I'll tell Mrs. Ryan you were here.  You can come back later.	Ahh--then she's still alive.
2 She's fine.  Please--	And still Mrs. Harold Ryan?
3 Will you please go?  An emergency!	She still has just the one child-- the boy?

1 Wasn't that sweet of me?	More and more we find ourselves laying aside false pride and looking into the pharmacopoeias of primitive people.  Curare, ephedrine--we've found some amazing things.
2 We have, have we?	That's an editorial we, of course. I haven't turned up anything personally.
3 Everything about you is the editorial we.  Take that away from you, and you'd disappear.

1 Hands and knees, you say?	And terror, if you don't mind.

1 And you, Colonel?  Let me guess: You don't know.	I dunno.

1 Don't touch me.	Wouldn't you rather have your mother marry me than him?
2 No.	All my dreams have suddenly collapsed.  We did have a lot of laughs together, Penelope.

1 Really?	It is an emergency, isn't it?
2 Yeah.	Then get him.
3 Okay.

1 Coming.	Women are always late.  You'll find out.

1 Herb Shuttle is taking me to a fight.	Take plenty of cigars.
2 We made the date three months ago.	I must take you to an emergency ward sometime--on a Saturday night. That's also fun.  I came to see Selma, as a matter of fact.
3 She quit this afternoon.

1 You fool, you fool.	Oh--look at the poor, crucified violin, would you?

1 Minors aren't allowed at fights.	Then we'd stay home and eat venison or something, and look through the scrapbooks.  I've got a friend who has a whole freezer full of striped bass and caribou meat.  I'm going to bring that boy back.

1 There's a girl I want to ask you about.	You're not Vice, are you?  Do you work for the Los Angeles Police Department, or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency?
2 No, I don't.	I have to ask you that. If you were Vice you couldn't deny it. You ought to dress less square. You wouldn't get hassled so much. Here, let me help you get that tie off.

1 What do you think of this... ah, shade of blue, Mary.	I like it, Mr. Van Dorn.
2 Don't you think it's a little too... bright?	Not really. But if you want me to tone it down...
3 No, no. I wouldn't hire a display designer if I didn't trust her taste. Maybe we should bring in more of that shade. Perhaps a stripe across the back wall.

1 I thought you were going to bed?	I am.

1 I is for Irresistible Grace. God's grace cannot be resisted or denied. And P is for the Perseverance of the Saints. Once you are in Grace you cannot fall from the number of the elect. And that's the 'TULIP.'	Wait, wait. I'm trying to figure this out. This is like Rona Barrett. Before you become saved, God already knows who you are?
2 He has to. That's Predestination. If God is omniscient, if He knows everything -- and He wouldn't be God if He didn't -- then He must have known, even before the creation of the world, the names of those who would be saved.	So it's already worked out. The fix is in?
3 More or less.	Wow. Then why be good? Either you're saved or you ain't.
4 Out of gratitude for being chosen. That's where Grace comes in. God first chooses you, then allows you, by Grace, to choose Him of your own free will.	You really believe all that?
5 Yeah.  Well, mostly.	I thought I was fucked up.
6 I'll admit it's confusing from the outside. You've got to see it from the inside.	If you see anything from the inside it makes sense. You ought to hear perverts talk. A guy once almost had me convinced to let his dachshund fuck me.
7 It's not quite the same thing.	It doesn't make any sense to me.

1 Listen, Niki. My daughter's been missing five months. I've gone through a lot to find out what's happened to her. I just saw a girl killed. I will not let Tod slip out of my hands. You have to tell me where he is.	But then you'll forget about me.
2 Where is he, Niki?

1 I'm only human, you know.	Get out.
2 But this is my apartment.	Get out!

1 How's your business, Jake?	Pretty good.
2 You should come around more often. You haven't been around for weeks. Anne complains she doesn't see you anymore.

1 You wait here. I'll find out where she is.	You ain't goin' nowhere alone.

1 I've got fifty thousand dollars to invest.	Oh.  Why is it that you want to get into film financing?
2 Well, Bill -- mind if I call you Bill?  Let me be frank. I've made a lot of money. I've got my own business in Detroit. Rivets. I make rivets and sell them to Fisher Body.  Well, rivets, you know, can get pretty boring after a while. When my business manager told me I should shelter some money, I thought I'd try this.	What exactly do you have in mind?
3 I thought I'd invest in a film. I want to sort of become involved in the process of making a film, meet the people who make films, learn how it's done...	In other words, you want to get laid?
4 Not exactly...	It's cool. Why do you think I got in the movies? How much poon do you think you get in the car wash business?  Look, fifty thousand dollars buys a lot of pussy. You can get your joint pulled by beautiful girls every night for the rest of your life for fifty thousand dollars. So why fuck with the movie business?
5 It's an investment.	If you want to watch when we shoot a film, for fifty bucks, I let guys stand around and watch. It's a lot cheaper.
6 I thought you were a businessman.	Don't get me wrong. A couple years ago, I woulda jumped at fifty thousand dollars possible financing. But the Lord's been good to me. I can now finance any films I choose. Big ones, small ones. Right now we're setting up a two hundred thousand dollar feature film. Live sound. I like to keep my own money in my films. That way you don't have to share the profits. There's plenty of guys in town that'll take it, though. But if I was you, Mr... what was your name again?
7 Jake.	...I'd just start my own business. That's what I did. Get into kid porn. That's big now. Why don't you come around the set? Meet some people. If you still want to invest, I'll ask around.
8 Sounds all right.	Okay. Keep in touch with my secretary.

1 You can fuck off, too.	You're taking a big chance.
2 I ain't ever gonna see him again anyway.	Oh no? What you gonna do? Get a job?

1 Okay, lady. Out.	Hello.

1 Eh, no. Thank you.	You're welcome.  Did you know him?
2 Eh, no.	Me neither. I heard he was eighty years old. I'll be eighty next week. A good time to move on, don't you think?
3 I don't know.	I mean, seventy-five is too early, but at eighty-five, well, you're just marking time and you may as well look over the horizon.

1 How about some ginger pie?	Eh, fine.
2 I'll heat some up. My, it's nice to see you again, Harold. How's your hearse?	Oh, it's fine. Fine.
3 She seemed yare to me.

1 Boy, Maude. The way you handle cars. I'd never handle a car like that.	Oh, it's only a machine, Harold. It's not as if it were <u>alive</u>, like a horse or a camel. We may live in a machine age, but I simply can't treat them as equals.  Of course, the age has its advantages.

1 No.	No more revolts.
2 Oh, yes! Every day. But I don't need a defense anymore. I embrace! Still fighting for the Big Issues but now in my small, individual way. Shall we have a song?	Well, I don't...
3 Oh come on. I'll teach you.

1 Yes. I understand. A lot of people enjoy being dead. But they are not dead really. They're just backing away from life.  They're players - but they sit on the bench. The game goes on before them. At any moment they can join in.  Reach out! Take a chance! Get hurt maybe. But play as well as you can.  Go team, go! Give me an "L." Give me an "I."  Give me a "V." Give me an "E." LIVE!!!!!  Otherwise you'll have nothing to talk about in the locker room.	I like you, Maude.
2 I like you, Harold.  Come, I'll teach you to waltz.

1 Don't you advance on me.	... of you. You'll all end up like this.

1 Supper for two.	Oh, you've thought of everything. And champagne.
2 It's all right. It's organic.	Oh, Harold. 
3 For you.

1 I'm going to marry the woman I love.	Harold!

1 I see. Junkyards. What is the fascination there?	I don't know.
2 Is it the machines? The noise? The people?	No. It's the junk. I like to look at junk.
3 What else do you like?

1 Boy, to think I could maybe make my own.	Harold! That's <u>disgusting</u>!

1 Well, well. All my family together again. How very sweet.	Julia.
2 Frank.	I knew you'd come.
3 You knew?	Yes. You're a girl who remembers her promises.
4 Oh, I do. I do.

1 So... You're Kirsty, huh?	You a doctor, too?

1 Get out of the way.	Are you crazy?
2 I don't know, Kyle. You're the fucking expert. Now get out of the way!	WHY?
3 Because I'm going to get my father!

1 Where am I?	You're in the Malahide Institute. It's a psychiatric hospital. But, hey, don't feel judged -- it was just the nearest place to bring you. Remember? You and your boyfriend...?
2 Steve...	Don't worry. He's O.K. We sent him home hours ago. Jeez, what a story.

1 How am I ever gonna get a girl?? I drive around in a garbage truck	Liz left us, Red. Take the hint.
2 We don't take hints.

1 harbinger of pestilence, seed of destruction --	Skip to the end, willya?  How do I kill it -- ?
2 It doesn't say --

1 Do you believe in hell?	There is a place -- a dark place where evil slumbers and awaits to return. From there it infects our dreams. Our thoughts. Grigory gave us a glance tonight --
2 Grigory -- That's Russian, right?  Thought they were on our side...	Grigory Yefimovich Rasputin --
3 C'mon -- Rasputin??	Spiritual advisor to the Romanovs.  In 1916, at a dinner in his honor, he was poisoned, shot, stabbed, clubbed, drowned and castrated.
4 That makes him more than a hundred --

1 They took his name from this little inscription that was stuck on his tank.	Icthyo Sapiens, April 14, 1865.
2 The day Abraham Lincoln died. Hence "Abe" Sapien.

1 C'mon, champ. You look a little woozy, there.	This -- ? This is nothing. You know what'll kill me?  Her.

1 But not everyone was so lucky.  Two agents died today. Clay probably won't survive the night. You're reckless.	I knew those men better than you did --
2 Ah, I see. That makes it all alright then.

1 Helping you -- I just --	No one ever helps me. It's my job.

1 Hey, your chili's getting cold --	Not hungry.

1 But I understand what you don't like about me. I do. What I am makes you feel out of place -- out there --	Red, I --
2 Listen. I'm not like Myers. He makes you feel like you belong. And -- that's good. It really is. I -- wish I could do something about this --  But I can't.  I can promise you only two things... One: I'll always look this good. Two: I won't give up on you. Ever.	I like that...
3 Good.

1 Wait! Wait! Watch the fucking paint work.	Look, do you want the bed in or not?
2 Just take it slowly.	Oh, sod you.

1 The box... you opened it. We came.	It's just a puzzle box.
2 It's a means to summon us -- it's called the Lament Configuration.	Who are you?
3 Cenobites. Explorers in the further regions of experience. Demons to some. Angels to others.	Well, I didn't mean to open that thing. You can go back wherever you came from.

1 Please. Get back into bed.	I have to speak to my father.
2 That's easily arranged. But first, back into bed.	It's important.
3 You took quite a beating. You must lie down.

1 You bastard --	Poor baby.
2 Bastard.	Hush now. It's all right Frank's here.
3 Frank --	That's right. This is Frank you're talking to, remember? FRANK.

1 You can't let me stay like this. Please. You can't.	What do you want me to do.
2 The blood brought me this far. I need more of the same. Or I'll slip back...

1 She'll tell them everything...	I don't think so. She'll want Larry first.
2 That's probably her now. Or the police.	Maybe.
3 Don't you care?	There's very little I can do about it.
4 Maybe we should just leave --	Like this? Look at me! LIKE THIS?
5 Well we can't just stay here --	I need a skin. Then we leave --

1 Why didn't he want to sell it?	I don't know. Probably wanted a hideaway.

1 What have you done?	I cut myself.

1 Who was it?	Kirsty.

1 What are you drinking?	Just soda.
2 Plain soda?	Please.
3 I try not to drink at lunch-time. Makes me sleepy in the afternoon. You like to keep a clear head, eh?  One soda, one whisky.  I do it anyway. No will-power. Got a busy afternoon?	That depends.
4 Oh?

1 You know, you're very beautiful.	Am I?
2 You know you are. Loveliest woman I ever set eyes on.

1 Well I want you to see the house.	I'm not going to change my mind, Dad.

1 I have to talk to you.	Of course.

1 You know I do know the way home.	It's late.
2 Not that late.	Please. I want to see you home. All right?
3 All right.  No. That's nice.	If there's a train.
4 What do we do if there isn't?	We walk.

1 I'll come back later, huh?	Sure. Why not?

1 Barry, I'm fucking broke!  I know we used to fuck with anyone who asked for anything we didn't like, but it's gotta stop.	Bullshit.  The guy was going to buy one record -- which we didn't even have -- and leave and never come back again anyway.  Why not have a little fun?  Big fucking deal.
2 What did he ever do to you?	He offended me with his terrible taste.
3 It wasn't even his terrible taste. It was his daughter's.	Oh, now you're defending that motherfucker?  You're going soft in your old age, Rob.  There was a time when you would have chased him out of the store and up the street.  Now all of a sudden I'm offending your golf buddy.  You're right, Rob.  I am so sorry. How are we ever going to make enough money to get you and Laura into the country club?

1 ...But the word "yet..." Yeah, you know what, I'd get the impression that you wanted to see it.  Otherwise you'd say you didn't really want to.	But in your opinion, would I definitely go?
2 How the fuck am I supposed to know that?  You might get sick of people telling you you've really gotta go see the movie.

1 It was Jan, and it was a long time after--	Whatever.  Okay. "Tell Laura I Love Her." That'd bring the house down. Laura's mom could sing it.
2 Fuck off, Barry.	I'd want "One Step Beyond" by Madness. And "You Can't Always Get What You Want."
3 Because it's in The Big Chill.	Haven't seen it.
4 Liar.  We saw it in the Lawrence Kasdan double-bill with Body Heat.	Oh.  Right.  But I'd forgotten about that.  I wasn't biting the idea.
5 Not really.

1 Holy Shiite!  What the fuck's this?	It's the new --

1 "Somebody's Gonna Die" by Blitz. "Bella Lugosi's Dead," Bauhaus. It's got that creepy Halloween feeling.	No.  No.  Mom wants you to come to the funeral.  It's on Friday.

1 It's all kind of lost in the... in the dense mists of time now... It wasn't that I really liked Marco more.  In fact I thought you were more, shall we say, attractive than him.  It was just that he knew he was good-looking and you didn't, and that made a difference somehow.  You used to act as if I was weird for wanting to spend time with you, and that got kind of beat, if you know what I mean.  Your self-image started to rub off on me and I ended up thinking that I was strange.  And I knew that you were kind and thoughtful... you made me laugh, and I dug the way you got consumed by things you loved... and Marco seemed a bit more, I don't know, glamorous? More sure of himself?  Less hard work, because I felt like I was dragging you around, sort of.  A little sunnier.  Sparkier.  I don't know.  You know what people are like at that age.  They make very superficial judgements.  Do you think that's superficial?  He was a clown, if it's any consolation.	Did you tell that to Marco when he did his what-does-it-all-mean thing with you?
2 Oh God, no.  I didn't want to hurt his feelings.

1 Rob --!	-- FUCK OFF!

1 What needs sorting out?	Come on, Rob.  My relationship with Laura has obviously disturbed you a great deal.
2 Funnily enough I haven't been too thrilled about it.	We are not talking jokey understatement here, Rob.  We're talking actionable harassment.  Ten phone calls a night, hanging around outside my house...
3 Yeah, well, I've stopped all that now.	We've noticed and we're glad.  But, you know... how are we going to make peace here?  We want to make things easier for you.  What can we do? Obviously I know how special Laura is, and I know things can't be good for you at the moment.  I'd hate it if I lost her.  But I'd like to think that if she decided she didn't want to see me anymore, I'd respect that decision.  Do you see what I'm saying?
4 Yeah.	Good.  So shall we leave it at that then?
5 I dunno.	Think about it, Rob.

1 But Laura... that's me.  That's all there is to me.  There isn't anything else.  If you've lost interest in that, you've lost interest in everything.	You really believe that?

1 Hi.	Hi.  I've been looking for an envelope of my receipts from last month and I'm thinking I didn't take them with me.  Have you seen them around?
2 I'll look for 'em.  How you doing?	I'm sorry to call, but I need that stuff...
3 Fine, I'm sure it's in the file at home.  I'll call you when I find it, and then we'll talk.	We'll talk some other time.
4 Great... That's great.

1 Don't forget your CDs.	Those aren't mine.
2 Sure they are.	They're not really, though, are they? I know you bought them for me, and that was really sweet of you, but that was when you were trying to turn me into you.  I can't take them, I know they'd just sit around staring at me, and I'd feel embarrassed by them and... they don't fit in with the rest of what's mine, do you understand?  That Sting record you bought for me... that was a present for me.  I like Sting and you hate him.  But the rest of this stuff...  Who the hell is Nick Lowe?  Or Gram Parsons?  Or the Boredoms?  I don't know these people.  I...
3 Okay, okay.  I get the picture.	I'm sorry to go on about it.  But, I don't know, there's a lesson here somewhere, and I want to make sure you get it.
4 I got it.  You like Sting but you don't like Gram Parsons, because you've never heard of him.	You're being deliberately obtuse.
5 I guess I am.	Well, think about it.

1 When are you going back?	I don't know.  Sometime.  Later. Listen, Rob, would you have sex with me?
2 What?	I want to feel something else than this.  It's either that or I go home and put my hand in the fire.  Unless you want to stub cigarettes out on my arm.
3 I've only got a couple left.  I'm saving them for later.	It'll have to be sex, then.

1 ... Like Mexico.  Or Jamaica.  Or New York, even.	Hey, great idea.  What I'll do is, tomorrow I'll get a hold of a box full of mint Elvis Presley 78s on the Sub label, and I'll pay for it that way.
2 I'll pay for you.  Even though you owe me money.  We have to do something with the money I earn.  I need to. I deserve it.  You can just think of it as winning the lottery.	Fantastic.  The Girlfriend Lottery.
3 Money does not matter.  I do not care how much you earn.  I'd just like you to be a little happier in your work, but beyond that you can do what you like.	But it wasn't supposed to be like this.  When I met you we were the same people and now we're not, and...
4 How?  How were we the same people?	Well, you were the kind of person who came to the Artful Dodger and I was the kind of person who deejayed at the Artful Dodger.  You wore jeans and T-shirts, and so did I.  And I still do, and you don't.
5 Because I'm not allowed to.  I still do, after work.  So, what?  Should we just break up?  Is that what you're saying?  Because if you are, I'm going to run out of patience.	No, but...
6 But what?	But why doesn't it matter that we're not the same people we used to be?
7 You haven't changed so much as a pair of socks in the years I've known you.  If we've grown apart, then I'm the one who's done the growing, and all I've done is change jobs.	And hairstyles and clothes and attitude and friends and...
8 I can't go to work with my hair dyed pink.  And I can afford to go shopping more now, and I've met a couple people I like over the last year or so.	You're tougher.
9 More confident, maybe.	Harder.
10 Less neurotic.  Are you intending to stay the same for the rest of your life?	I'm alright.
11 Yeah, you're alright.  But you're certainly not happy.  So what happens if you get happy?  And yes I know that's the title of an Elvis Costello album, I use the reference deliberately to catch your attention. Should we split up because I'm used to you being miserable?  What happens if you, I don't know, start you're own record label, and it's a success? Time for a new girlfriend?	You're being stupid.
12 How?  What would be the difference between you having a record label and me going from legal aid to private practice?

1 I'm an idiot.  I should have played the record first.  This place is about to get burned down.	It's gonna be fine.  These people are ready for anything.

1 She just wanted to pick up some stuff. No big thing.  A relief, actually.	God, I hate that time.  That pick up stuff time.  I just went through that before I came here.  You know that song "Patsy Cline Times Two" I play?  That's about me and my ex dividing up our record collections.
2 It's a great song.	Thank you.

1 Yeah?	Hi, Rob.  It's your mother.

1 I think you have more.	Well we don't.
2 I can't frisk you but the cops can.

1 Doesn't have a head, does he?	This one came unassembled.

1 Miss Cartwright, what is it I can do for you?	I'd like to ask you about the claymore.
2 It's not mine.	It's quite rare you know, some- thing so common in its time so well looked after all these years.
3 Miss Cartwright, unless you have come here to sell the sword, there's very little I can help you with.  Now if you will excuse me, I have a great deal of work to do.

1 He sees me as a threat.	Are you?

1 Here, try this.  I suppose they're still making women the same as back then.	It's beautiful.
2 A little dusty.

1 What is it like?  Being you?	Empty.  And fear.  Fear of those that would kill you and fear of those that would love you.  It can never last, and in the end you always end up destroying both.
2 But you're known so much. History I'll only read about.	It's all the same.  Half lives that never go away.
3 What is it you want?	All of it finished.

1 Forgers do it all the time.  They take the birth certificate of some- one who died young and use it to get legit I.D.  Usually they carry it long enough to pass some bad checks then dump it.	Thanks.
2 Call your mother.  You never call her.

1 Someone should check him out. Maybe a collection somewhere got knocked over.  He has one, he might have two.	You see that desk?  _Your_ desk?  You see the crap piled up on it?
2 Give it a rest Ned, huh?

1 He told me there could be only one.	Some cling to sanity through time with the one continuity and trad0 ition their lives have known: The Game.  You and I Conor, we are different from all others around us.  You know this, you can feel it.  We are flesh and bone like any man, but unlike our neighbors we are rather difficult to injure,  permanently.
2 I don't understand.	You are still so very young.
3 I'm twenty-two.	Not even a single lifetime.

1 It will take less effort as you learn.	It's like to kill me first.

1 Oh please.  Another one.	What would you like?
2 Something pretty.	Like you.

1 Your name?	Mulet.

1 Fish are creatures of habit.  They like their food where they're used to it.  At the top, hiding in old leaves.	Where did you learn that?
2 My father taught me.	Your father must be smart.
3 Yes, he was.

1 And have you something to settle with me?	Not tonight.  Tonight I have a drink with an old friend.
2 It's good to see you, Kahn.

1 Friend of yours?	Of sorts.
2 I do hope she enjoys a good show.

1 What were _you_ looking for?	That's none of your business.
2 You're wrong.

1 This is Murphy. More slop on the hanging.	A double guard's been thrown around the jail, municipal buildings, railroad terminals, and elevated stations to prepare for the expected general uprising of radicals at the hour of execution.
2 Ready? The Sheriff's just put two hundred more relatives on the payroll to protect the city against the Red Army -- which is leaving Moscow in a couple of minutes.  Up a dime.	The Sheriff has just received four more letters threatening his life, but he says nothing can interfere with his duty.
3 And to prove to the voters that the Red Menace is on the level, the Sheriff has written himself four more letters, threatening his life. I know he wrote 'em on account of the misspellings.

1 I'll keep you in mind.	Au revoir, mon capitaine.
2 Bon jour!

1 Hildy Johnson... Oh, hello, Bruce. Have you got it? Is it certified?	Certified and everything. Got it right here in my wallet... What? No, he's not here -- I'm in a phone booth.

1 Here it is, Bruce. One -- two -- three -- four hundred -- and fifty dollars.	Thank you.

1 Well, I'll try to give her one.	I know you will, Bruce. Are you going to live with your mother?
2 Just for the first year.	That'll be nice. A home with mother. A real honeymoon. In Albany, too. Ow!

1 Well, Bruce, here you are -- certified and everything.	Certified! I'm afraid Hildy'd feel ashamed to think she hadn't trusted you.

1 Oh, Bruce, let me see that money Hildy gave you.	The money? Why?
2 There's a lot of counterfeit big bills going around.	Gee! Take a look, will you?

1 You're going to be in office for exactly two days more and then we're pulling your nose out of the feed bag.	Give me the District Attorney's office.  I'll tell you what you'll be doing -- making brooms in the State penitentiary.  Hello, D'Arrasty! This is Hartwell. Come over to my office, will you? I've just arrested a couple of important birds and I want to take their confessions.

1 Sweeney! You can't do that to me! Not today, of all days! Jumping Jehosophat! Oh, no, Sweeney... Well, I suppose so... All right. If you have to, you have to.  How do you like that? Everything happens to me -- with 365 days in the year -- this has to be the day.	What's the matter?
2 Sweeney.	Dead?
3 Not yet. Might just as well be. The only man on the paper who can write -- and his wife picks this morning to have a baby!	Sweeney?  Well, after all, he didn't do it on purpose, did he?
4 I don't care whether he did or not. He's supposed to be covering the Earl Williams case and there he is -- waiting at the hospital! Is there no sense of honor left in this country?	Well, haven't you got anybody else?
5 There's nobody else on the paper who can write! This'll break me, unless --  Hildy!	No!
6 You've got to help me, Hildy.	Keep away --
7 It'll bring us together again, Hildy -- just the way we used to be.	That's what I'm afraid of. "Any time -- any place -- anywhere!"
8 Don't mock, Hildy, this is bigger than anything that's happened to us. Don't do it for me! Do it for the paper.	Get away, Svengali.
9 If you won't do it for love, how about money? Forget the other offer and I'll raise you twenty-five bucks a week.	Listen, you bumble-headed baboon --
10 All right -- thirty-five, and not a cent more!	Please! Will you just --
11 Great grief! What's that other paper going to give you?	I'm not working for any other paper!
12 Oh! In that case, the raise is off and you go back to your old salary and like it. Trying to blackjack --	Look at this! 

1 If he's nuts, why doesn't the State just put him away?	Because it happened to be a colored policeman.
2 The colored vote happens to be very important to the Mayor of this town.	Especially with an election coming up in a few days.

1 Hildy!	Huh!
2 Get the lead out of your typewriter and start pounding out a load, will you? Snap into it!	How much do you want on it?
3 All the words you've got.	Where's some paper?

1 Where's Mrs. Baldwin?	What did you do with her?
2 What happened?	You been in a fight?

1 No, you don't! Walter!	What is it? Here!

1 What!	Now don't argue, Hildy.  How about it, Judge?

1 Butter-fingers! I give you an old lady to take somewhere, and you hand her over to the cops!	What do you mean, I handed her? The patrol wagon was on the wrong side of the street.
2 Now everything's fine. She's probably squawking her head off in some police station.	I don't think she's talking much... You know what I mean?

1 There's money in it, Cooley.	I can't Hildy. It means my job! It means --
2 A lot of money.  Four hundred and fifty dollars --

1 Say, that's old Prissy Bensinger's desk.	I know, I just want to give him a thrill.

1 That must be the tenth alienist they've had on Williams. Even if he wasn't crazy before, he would be after ten of those babies got through psychoanalyzing him.  Gimme the desk.	This Egelhoffer's pretty good.
2 Yeah? What did he ever do for his country?	Don't you remember? He's the guy went to Washington to interview the Brain Trust, and gave out a statement that they were all sane. It created a sensation!

1 Come on, you! Before we slap you down.	Do you want us to call the cops and have them give you the boots?
2 Where is he, before we beat it out of you?

1 No -- just coffee, Gus.	Just coffee.  And you, sir?

1 Where'd you get this?	I've got a right to carry a gun if I want to.
2 Not this gun!

1 Just one second --	That's good, because my health ain't what it used to be.

1 Hold your horses -- will you, Olsen? Hurry up, Fred!	Now what do you say?

1 Fine, thanks, Sheriff.	That's good, Earl. Oh, they've got another alienist to see you. He ought to be here any minute. Don't go to sleep, will you?
2 I won't.	Hildy, how'd you like a couple of tickets for the hanging?

1 Gentlemen of the Press! Always picking on somebody who can't defend himself -- the littler the better.	Phone for you, Hildy.
2 Who is it?	Oh, some insurance man. Are you in?
3 Give me that!

1 Did you get that, Hildy?	No -- what?

1 Mother!	Don't you mother me! Playing cat-and- mouse with my poor boy! Keeping him looked up -- making us miss two trains -- and supposed to be married tomorrow!
2 Mother, I can explain everything. I'll go with you in five minutes and --	You don't have to go with me at all! Just give me my son's money and you can stay here forever as far as I'm concerned. Stay with that murderer you caught!

1 Earl, there's just one thing I ought to clear up for the interview.	What's that? Only -- you're getting too near. I don't trust anybody.
2 I don't blame you, Earl.  If I were in your place I wouldn't trust anybody, either.	Keep away!

1 They'll get him! They'll get him!	Ssh!

1 Why not?	I couldn't work in the city. You see, I've got my family in the country.
2 But you could bring 'em in here! We'll pay all your expenses.	No, I don't think so.
3 For heaven's sake, why not?	I got two kids going to school there, and if I changed them from one town to another, they'd lose a grade.
4 No, they wouldn't -- they'd gain one! And I guarantee that they'll graduate with highest honors!	Yeah?

1 Get the cops, somebody.	Come on, fellas.

1 Never let a rat creep up on you.	I think you hit him, Grandpa. He was limping when he ran off.

1 I never was.	Yes, you was. Make him talk.

1 Bruce, look! Dad got some German jam.	We thought it was poison.

1 But Dad, It's the News.	Thanks, son. I can hear it. I'm not sleeping, just closing my eyes.

1 ...It was a toss-up. His company went to India, mine went to France. Flip of a coin.	...two Indians to fan me all night. The heat.
2 ....buried In a shell-hole for thee days, while he's out there playing polo and sticking pigs.

1 So you're going to be a grandfather.	And I'm still just a lad myself.
2 Don't bother to grow up. It's no fun at all.

1 When do you think you'll get leave again?	Not till Christmas, I don't suppose.

1 I want him. I want him so much. I'll kill myself if I can't have him.	There, there, my baby.

1 It was the best time of his life.	How many of our class left? You and me out of twenty-eight.

1 Bless you, Mac. What would I have done without you?	You might still have a house.
2 I wish it could all have been different.	Look after yourself, Grace.

1 You're having me on, Molly.	Am I? Maybe I am.
2 You've been drinking. Your tipsy.	Tipsy, topsy, turvy.

1 I'll cut your fucking tits off and shove 'em down your throat.	Baby! Stop!

1 Don't worry, I'll be right back.	Come on.

1 Can I help you with something?	I was just wondering.
2 Wondering what?	Are you two gals all funny with each other?
3 What?	You know... a couple of queers.
4 Do you believe this fucking girl?	I was just wondering, cause you got a pissy look about you... like a real pussy licking bitch.

1 Really? Huh, I thought for sure you'd say Lynette Fromme. She's got that snooty vibe I know you dig.	Sqeaky! No way, she ain't that hot.
2 She's pretty cute.	Yeah but, she reminds me of this chick that I remember from fourth grade... called a... shit, what did we call her?  Oh yeah, Patty Pee-pee Pants... when ever she got called on by Miss Chumski, this chick would piss in her pants and start bawling.
3 There always one kid with no bodily controls. We had this dude, Jeff Baxter, he was a puker. The fucker would just sit there puke all over himself.	Better than pissing... anyway so, what's your choice?
4 If we're talking cute... like regular cute, I'd say Leslie Van Houton, but cute ain't hot.	Yeah, no shit.
5 As far a hot... goes I gotta go with... Ruth Ann Moorehouse.	Oh yeah, I forgot about her. She was pretty hot.
6 Fuck yeah, she is. I'd join a cult to get some of that... and the best part is she didn't try to kill the President or nothing, so that baggage ain't hanging around.	I thought she tried to murder a witness for the prosecution.
7 I'll let it slide, she was only seventeen.	Dude, talk about baggage, that ain't no carry-on shit, that's some heavy duty Samsonite shit.
8 Yeah, I guess... hot chicks are always nuts.	Hot has got nothing to do with it.

1 OK, let's relax. I'll check it, maybe I'm wrong. Don't everybody freak out just yet.	I'll help ya.
2 Gee, ya think it wouldn't be too much trouble.

1 Yeah, maybe R.J. could just tow us and our car to the nearest garage.	I mean obviously we will compensate you for your troubles.

1 Why are we stopping?	There's a dog in the road.

1 What are you doing!	I gotta open the gate.
2 Drive through it!	It won't work.

1 How long is that gonna take?	He should be back in a couple hours.

1 Yeah, Jerry, she said some pretty fucked shit to us.	When?
2 When you were outside with Bill.

1 I swear I've aged five years since this trip started.	Tell me about it.
2 God, I hate falling asleep in the afternoon. Now I'll be up all night...  ...ugh, my back is killing me.	Yeah, hey how far do you think we are from your Dad's?

1 I don't hear anything.	Shhhhhh, quiet.
2 I still don't.	Turn on the headlights. See if anything is out there.

1 And I'm gonna help put the razor blades in the candy apples.	I'll bet you are... you are a naughty little thing aren't ya.
2 I was just kidding.

1 Hold on, hold on! Everybody calm down! It's the tow truck guy.	What!

1 Fuck you, you fucking freak!	Oh, come now... we're all creatures of God and freaks in our own way...  ...but if you'll notice...  right here, needs a little something, heh?

1 Get in... now!	Wait, I want to say good-bye.

1 Jesus Christ.	Call Wydell.

1 You sure this guy's supposed to ride with us? Seems kind of weird.	Chief said pick him up and take him with us on our house to house. Guy's an ex-cop, thinks he can help.
2 Sounds like a bad idea to me, probally just get in the way.	Yeah, well I guess it's tough to sit on the sidelines and wait when your own kid's missing... besides, ain't no such thing as an ex-cop.
3 I guess not.	That must be him.

1 Tell him, Harold.	It's going famously, son, famously!

1 Thank you so much for accompanying me.	Not at all.
2 I have had such a difficult time in my personal life and you seem to be such a nice man... but I'm talking too much again, no?	Of course not.
3 You're so sweet. Oh, why are there not more men out there like you?

1 Isn't Puff doing spectacularly, honey?	Hmmmph.
2 Gabby, what is it?	Hmmph. Hmmph.  Nathan, we have to talk, you and I.
3 Fine.	Not in front of the boy.
4 Very well.

1 You were wonderful!	Was I? I wasn't a tad stiff?
2 Don't be silly!  And you were wonderful, too! I loved the way you said " au revoir."

1 We're going back to nature, you and I. I'm going to retrain you. I'm going to make you free again if I have to kill you doing it.	But I like being human now.

1 I don't know, honey. I don't know. Maybe he just didn't want to get involved.	Oh, Rosie.
2 Let's get you out of here. Come stay with me until you get your strength back.  Free electrolysis, if you want it! We'll get that face of yours cleared up in no time.

1 It's just that I have some peculiarities, and...	I like you, too, Nathan.
2 You do?	Yeah  But I have some peculiarities also.
3 I don't care. I don't care!  Like what, for example?

1 You'll catch cold. It's cold.  What do you suppose he is, a survivalist?	I think he's feral.
2 Feral? Don't touch him! He might be diseased! He might... My God, rabies!	He looks perfectly fine.
3 I think we should go. Please. Before he wakes up and, I don't know, eats us, or whatever feral things do.	I don't understand you. This is fascinating and you just want to run away. I mean, here we have a human being totally uncontaminated by civilization, totally free, and all you want to do is run back to your...
4 Actually, I just had an amusing thought.	What?
5 Feral, huh? Totally uncontaminated?	Look at him. He doesn't understand English. He moves like an animal.
6 It's perfect!	Nathan, what the hell are you talking about?
7 Forget mice! Actually forget guinea pigs, cats, monkeys, and chimps also. I'm on to stage five: The human subject.	Oh no. You can't take him from his home, Nathan.
8 Don't you see? He's my Tabula Rasa, my Eliza Dolittle. He's my ticket to the top of the Behaviorist food chain. He's going to make me famous.	I won't allow you. It's wrong. He's happy here.
9 Is he, Lila? Is he happy living filthy and naked alone in this tick infested wilderness? Never to know the love of a good woman, never to revel in the pitter-patter of little feet, never to read Moby Dick, or marvel at a Monet, or just sit back after a day of hard but rewarding work, smoke a pipe, and wonder about the nature of reality.	You'd be taking away his freedom, Nathan.
10 Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose, Lila, to quote Janet Jackson.

1 Are you seeing somebody else, Nathan? I just have to know.	Of course not.
2 It would just be helpful to know.	No.
3 Because, you know, you seem so distant. And you work late every night. And we hardly ever have sex, and when we do, it's... I don't know. It feels different.	I'm just preoccupied.
4 Do you like my new look?	Yeah. It's nice. It's really good.
5 I'm trying, you know.  I'm trying to be what you want. I want to be what you want, Nathan. All I want is to be what you want.	Shh. It's okay.  It's okay, Lila. You're what I want. You know that. You're exactly what I want.
6 Really?	Sure. Of course.
7 Because I'm really trying, you know. Rosie says maybe only another two years of the elctrolysis.	That's great.
8 I've signed up for a ballet class. And look at my nails! A real girl!

1 You were gone a long time.	Yeah. Puff and I got into a big, philosophical discussion. He's really quite well read, considering he's only been literate for a month now. He's going to make us famous, Lila.
2 So he's doing okay?	Seemed fine. Quiet evening enjoying his new digs.
3 That's funny because, you know, I just went and picked him up at some flophouse on the lower eastside. He called here when he ran out of his "mad" money after spending an entire evening drinking, watching strippers, and fucking a whore!  Oh, and what did you do tonight, honey?	Shit.
4 And what did you do tonight, honey?	I've fallen in love with somebody else, Lila.
5 And what did you do tonight, honey?	I fucked her! Okay? I fucked her. I'm sorry. But that's what the hell I did.
6 Do you know what I gave up to be with you?	Yes.
7 I gave up my soul, my beliefs. I gave up my body hair!	Yeah, well, I'm sorry. The human heart is a strange thing.
8 How the hell would you know anything about the human heart?	Lila...

1 Free to come and go as you please. There's some "mad money" in the night table drawer.	It's wonderful! Do you think I'm ready? Do you really?
2 I trust that you'll make good, mature decisions. I trust that you'll do the proper thing.	Oh, I will!  Your very trust has instilled an enormous sense of responsibility in me. I don't want to disappoint you.
3 Good. Remember, when in doubt: Don't ever do what you really want to do.	Got it.

1 Mother?	Yes... Derek.

1 I'm ready.	Soon as I finish my coffee.

1 Put it on the bed. That's the way it's done, isn't it?	That's the way it's done.
2 And the way you're looking at me, is that the way you look at a man you've just beaten? As if you'd just taken his money, and now all you want is... his pride?	All I want's the money.
3 Sure, sure, just the money, and the aristocratic pleasure of seeing him fall apart. You're a Roman, Bert. You have to win them all.

1 Stay with this kid. He's a loser.	What did he say?

1 James Findley is a very rich man. Grandfather left him twenty per cent of a tobacco company.	What? And he -- he hustles pool?
2 He's a gentleman. Gentleman gambler. He gets his kicks playing with hustlers. He's got an old Southern mansion with a pool table in the basement, drinks eight-year-old bourbon, smokes cork-tipped cigarettes.	How good is he?
3 I don't know. Never saw him play. They say he's one of the best.

1 Well, we won't.	C'mon, Bert. Let me play him.
2 How much?

1 So you figure you're still my manager, huh?	I'm a businessman, kid.
2 Well, you got a lot of games lined up for me?	Yeah, we're gonna make a lotta money together, from now on.
3 Fifty per cent?	No, it don't have to be fifty. It can be thirty... twenty-five.
4 We really stuck the knife in her, didn't we, Bert?	Aaaahhhh!
5 Boy, we really gave it to her good.	If it didn't happen in Louisville, it'd happened someplace else. If it didn't happen now, it'd happen six months from now. That's the kinda dame she was.
6 And we twisted it, didn't we, Bert? Course, maybe that doesn't stick in your throat cause you spit it out just like you spit out everything else. But it sticks in mine. I loved her, Bert. I traded her in on a pool game. But that wouldn't mean anything to you. Because who did you ever care about? Just win, win, you said, win, that's the important thing. You don't know what winnin' is, Bert. You're a loser. 'Cause you're dead inside, and you can't live unless you make everything else dead around ya.

1 Ten grand. I'm gonna win ten grand in one night.  ...Well, who's gonna beat me? C'mon, Charlie, who's gonna beat me?	Okay... Okay. Nobody can beat you.
2 Ten grand! I mean, what other poolroom is there in the country where a guy can walk out with ten grand in one night? Jeez, you know, I can remember hustling an old man for a dime a game.

1 You walked out on me like that. No goodbye, no nothing. Like a thief in the dark. We were partners. We were more than partners.  He was like a... like --	A son.
2 Yeah, yeah, like a son.  I've known this boy since he was sixteen. The first time I saw him, back in Oakland, I said, "This is a talented boy. This is a smart boy."	Talk to me, Charlie.
3 I want you to come back on the road with me.	Aah! I've got no stomach for that any more. I've had that kind of life.
4 What kind of life have you got here? Scufflin' around the small rooms, picking up eight, ten bucks a day?	I'll connect. I'll get you your money back.
5 Are you figuring on going back to Ames to play Minnesota Fats again? Is that what's on your mind?	Never been out of it. I'm gonna beat that fat man... with that curly hair, and those diamond rings, and that carnation.
6 This boy's crazy. They wiped the floor with him. They beat his brains out and he wants to go back.  What for? To take another beating?	I told you you'd get your money back.
7 He thinks I care about the money.  I care about you. Do you care about me, Eddie? We're together a long time, night and day. So how do you say goodbye?  You gimme the car and a hundred bucks. You think I care about the dough, the car? I care about you.  This boy is the greatest pool hustler you ever saw. A real high-class con man. He can charm anybody into anything. Did he ever tell you how well we were doing on the road? We had everything: we ate good, we slept late, we had money to burn. Whisky, dames...  Excuse me...  I'll tell you what -- take her along.

1 Beautiful shot, Felson. Beautiful. You've played billiards before, Mr. Felson. Ah, you gentlemen sure you don't care for a drink?	Oh no, nothing for me.

1 You better not miss, friend.	I don't rattle, kid. But just for that I'm gonna beat you flat.

1 You talk kind of funny, but I like it.	I used to be an actress.
2 Yeah? What do you do now?	I'm a college girl. Two days a week, Tuesdays and Thursdays, I go to college.
3 You don't look like a college girl.	I'm the emancipated type. Real emancipated.
4 No, I didn't mean that -- whatever that means. I mean, you just don't look young enough.	I'm not.
5 So why go to college?	I've got nothing else to do on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
6 What do you do on the other days?	I drink.
7 Hey!	No. No more. I'm getting sleepy.  Thank you very much, Mr...?
8 Eddie. The name is Eddie.	The name should be Eddie. What should my name be?
9 I don't know. Whatever you like it to be.	I like it to be what it is. It's Sarah. That's a biblical name. You want to know its meaning?
10 I could always get us a bottle.	No.
11 Fifth of scotch?	What do you want me to do, just step out in the alley? Is that it?
12 No. I'll take you home.

1 Oh, cut my finger.	I've got something in my bag.
2 Oh, it's not bad.

1 Sarah, do you think I'm a loser?	A loser?
2 Yeah. I met this guy -- Gordon, Bert Gordon. He said I was. Born loser.	Would he know?
3 He knows. A lot.	Why did he tell you?
4 I don't know. I'm not sure. He said there are people who want to lose, who are always looking for an excuse to lose.	What does he do, this Bert Gordon?
5 He's a gambler.	Is he a winner?
6 Well, he owns things.	Is that what makes a winner?
7 Well, what else does?	Does it bother you? What he said?
8 Yeah.  Yeah. It bothers me a lot.  'Cause, you see, twice, Sarah -- once at Ames with Minnesota Fats and then again at Arthur's...  ...in that cheap, crummy poolroom... Now, why'd I do it, Sarah? Why'd I do it? I coulda beat that guy, I coulda beat him cold. He never woulda known. But I just had to show 'em, I just had to show those creeps and those punks what the game is like when it's great, when it's really great. You know, like anything can be great -- anything can be great... I don't care, bricklaying can be great. If a guy knows. If he knows what he's doing and why, and if he can make it come off. I mean, when I'm goin' -- when I'm really goin' -- I feel like...  ...like a jockey must feel. He's sittin' on his horse, he's got all that speed and that power underneath him, he's comin' into the stretch, the pressure's on him -- and he knows -- just feels -- when to let it go, and how much. 'Cause he's got everything workin' for him -- timing, touch. It's a great feeling, boy, it's a real great feeling when you're right, and you know you're right. It's like all of a sudden I got oil in my arm. Pool cue's part of me. You know, it's a -- pool cue's got nerves in it. It's a piece of wood -- it's got nerves in it. You feel the roll of those balls. You don't have to look. You just know. Ya make shots that nobody's ever made before. And you play that game the way nobody's ever played it before.	You're not a loser, Eddie. You're a winner. Some men never get to feel that way about anything. I love you, Eddie.

1 If you don't mind I think I'll stay at the hotel.	Well, what's the matter?
2 I'm a little tired.

1 Fats, I got about two hundred dollars here.	Game's over, Eddie.
2 Fats, look, I got about two hundred dollars here. You can't run out on me.	You watch me.

1 Do you remember where you lived?	It was warm.  I was outside.  The ocean?
2 What about... now?	With them?
3 Yes.	We move.  Place to place.

1 Mine.	Have you always had it?
2 I don't know.	Have you looked inside?
3 Yes.	What's inside?
4 Humans.	Who?
5 I don't know.

1 Need some gas?	Please.
2 Only got one kind.	That's fine.

1 There are more this year than last.	This should be the heaviest shower of the year.
2 There's Cassius ...

1 ... And then everything blew up. And then I woke up.	That's a doozy of a dream, son.
2 It was so real, Dad.	It was all made of stuff that's happened to you in the last few days.  The sand pit in back of the house, and the meteor shower, and meeting your teacher and the colonel at school, and being afraid of the new kids because you don't know them ...

1 What do you mean -- gone?  What the hell kind of a nurse are you, anyway?	I'm sorry, Mr. Gardner.  I was out of my office for a minute and when I got back -- he was gone.

1 They'll get us.	We'll be very careful.  But we have to see.  If something landed there, there would be a big scar in the ground. Wouldn't there?

1 Well, come on, you two.  Time to go to bed.	Mom -- this is the best show all year.
2 I know.  But you have a full day of school tomorrow --  You, too.

1 Penicillin. At least it will help keep his fever down.	It's really nice of you to help us.
2 I wish I could do more but we're moving out.	We're going with you. I mean, we're going too.
3 Cool.

1 Thirty seconds? Isn't that cutting it a little too close?	We'll be well on our way out of there before we shoot that thing off.

1 We're losing them.	Then get them out of there.

1 Then what?	Checkmate.

1 It's Air Force One for crying out loud. Still he gets sick?	Moishe, please, don't talk.

1 What're you doing?	It's not me. They're overriding the system.

1 Organize every plane you can find and get some Goddamned pilots to fly them.	Yes, Sir.

1 That's impossible...	My God, the Vice President and the Joint Chiefs...
2 Mr. President, we must launch. A delay now would be more costly than when you waited to evacuate the cities!

1 You're late.	You know me...
2 I know, you like to make a big entrance.

1 I shouldn't have left her.	Don't worry, big guy. I'm sure she got out of here before it happened.

1 We're leaving, don't try and stop us.	You're not going anywhere. You hear me? I'm still your father.

1 Mr. President, a real pleasure. They don't let us out much, you know.	Yes.
2 Well, I guess you'd like to see the big tamale? Follow me.

1 Yes.	Egyptian Mail. Morning edition.  Run!
2 Did you say...? Uh, uh...

1 But if you want facts, Indy, I have none to give you. At my age, I'm prepared to take a few things on faith.	Call Donovan, Marcus. Tell him I'll take that ticket to Venice now.
2 I'll tell him we'll take two.

1 Marcus!	Arghhh! Oh!

1 My name is Donovan. Walter Donovan.	I know who you are Mr. Donovan. Your contributions to the museum over the years have been extremely generous. Some of the pieces in your collection here are very impressive.
2 Well, like yourself, Doctor Jones, I have a passion for antiquities.  Have a look over here. This might interest you.

1 Doctor Jones?	Yes?
2 I knew it was you --

1 What's that?	It's a rubbing Dad made of the Grail Tablet.

1 This book contained a map -- a map with no names -- precise directions from the unknown city to the secret Canyon of the Crescent Moon.	So it did.

1 Oh, it breaks the heart.	And the head.  You hit me, Dad!
2 I'll never forgive myself --	Don't worry -- I'm fine.
3 Thank God!

1 I ought to tell you something.	Don't get sentimental now Dad -- save it 'til we get out of here.
2 The floor's on fire! See?!	What???
3 And the chair.	All right, move! Move! Rock your Chair. Do what I do.

1 When we're airborne, with Germany behind us, then I'll share that sentiment.	Relax.

1 This is intolerable!	This could be close.

1 What did you find, Junior?	Junior?! Dad...

1 Why are you trying to kill us?	Because you're looking for the Holy Grail.
2 My father was looking for the Holy Grail. Did you kill him too?	No.
3 Where is he? Talk -- or you're dead. Damn it, tell me! Tell me!	If you don't let go, Doctor Jones, we'll both die.
4 Then we'll die.	My soul is prepared. How's yours?

1 The Prime Minister doesn't seem that naive.	No, he's a very shrewd old boy. Power behind the throne and all that. He actually runs this whole province.

1 He's not exactly what we call "a spring chicken".	No, no, that is Uhmed Singh, the present Maharajah's late father.
2 Oh -- good. And maybe the present Maharajah is a little younger? And thinner?

1 You know the villagers also claimed that this palace stole something from them.	Dr. Jones, in our country a guest does not usually insult his host.
2 Sorry, I thought we were just talking about folklore.

1 Now what about the antidote, Lao.	At last I have the ashes of my sacred ancestor!

1 Get to sleep Indy -- I stay up and keep eye on things...	Okay, Shorty... see you in the morning... I'm going to have a little -- word with Willie.

1 Give me the stones!	Mola Ram -- you're about to meet Kali -- in Hell!

1 For crying out loud, a kid's driving the car?!	Relax, I've been giving him lessons.

1 What'd he say?	He told me they knew I was coming here.
2 What do you mean -- how?	The old man saw it in a dream.
3 Dream -- nightmare is more like it.	He said that's whey they were at river -- they were waiting for the plane to fall down.

1 Listen, Willie. Do exactly what I tell you now.	What?!
2 Can you move your arm?	Just one arm!
3 Okay, I want you to lift your hand -- and pet the snake.	PET IT??!!
4 Yes, stroke it right along the maxillary and precaudal vertebrae.	THE WHAT?!
5 Pet it on the head! Go on, pet it!

1 I think you should sleep closer.  I meant for safety.	I'd be safer sleeping with that snake.

1 Primitive sexual practices?	You're talking to an authority in that area.

1 GET US OUT! Willie, shut up and listen! There's got to be a fulcrum release! Look around!	A what?!

1 Indy? Did you talk to them?	Yes.
2 So now they believe me.	Yes, they believe you.

1 Give me your hat...	What for?
2 I'm going to puke in it...

1 You're in my head...	Yes.
2 Your name is Al...	Yes.
3 I see...

1 You're not crazy. Don't...wait a minute, just let me explain.	You're gonna explain.
2 Yeah JOE Why there's a little man in my head?	Yeah.
3 Why he's argumentative?	Yes...Yes...I'll explain it all. Just put the gun down.

1 Now what?	Whatever you do, just...don't stop.

1 Ever think of what they might have to do to find me?	Find You?
2 I'm not gonna make it easy.

1 Anything...A feeling...a smell..?	Nothing!

1 They'll know who I am.	We'll change your appearance.

1 Beautiful!	What was?
2 A girl.

1 Touch her.	What?
2 Touch some part of her body. Trust me. It works.

1 Mind your own business.	It is my business. It's my name.
2 But the rest is me. I'll dress like I want.

1 I feel like an idiot.	Just hold them close and stay still.

1 Ahhh...works...Ryuji... travel...just business...She's.. Fine Arts, University of Tokyo..	Is that all?
2 Oh, you were right. They've all been here before... met just last week.

1 Beer. And cakes...cookies ..anything bad.	That's not funny.

1 What are you doing?	Trying to analyze this stuff. Now...go to the medicine shelf and take ---- and ----.

1 What was it? What'd I say?	You said 100,000 yen for the right Sony Walkman.

1 He aready made the deal..	The man we want has the PEM, and is across the border by now.
2 Dieter!	GRUNER switched the chip to him, not from him, then he led us away again...to Chiang Cho.

1 I know it's no good.  I've no right to be jealous.	She's in love with you. Anyone can see that.
2 They can?

1 I've got twenty hours left. I could die in here. And you're falling in love.	JOE It's not love. It's like. It's real strong like. And I got your information. Now, get off my back!
2 Some friend you are! You know what I hope?

1 Can you fly this?	Don't worry.

1 If there is a POD inside him, We'll find it, and bring it out for study.	Who's our little man?
2 Me.	No. If anything happened, you'd be stuck in there like he was.
3 I take the last chip in with me. I use it, to control re-enlargement, from inside.

1 What are you doing here, where've you been?	I have a new client.
2 That crazy guy?	Yes. Joe.

1 Now, Joe, you know it was all a mistake, don't you?	No, it wasn't, It was intentional.
2 Why would we want to hurt you?	Not you. Them.
3 Who?	I don't know Who.

1 How's that for fucking Savoir Fair!	Sir?

1 Blake said that?	Yeah. One of the corniest lines I ever heard.

1 Promise you what?	That you're not crazy.
2 I promise you that. I am not crazy. Course, if I was, I'd be the last to know. Why do you ask?	You talk to yourself.
3 But I don't listen...then I'd be crazy.	Why do you do it?
4 If I was with you, I wouldn't	You did.
5 That was then. This is now. Who am I talking to?	You're talking to me.
6 And how'm I doing?	You're doing...Okay.
7 Just Okay...

1 What's Gruner like?	They'd never talk in front of me. They'd walk away up the beach. Nervous about something.
2 Who was?	Ryuji and Gruner.
3 And Dieter.	Friend of Gruner. Just went along for the party.
4 And you?	It was a good job. Not many ways for a foreigner to make money here. Ryuji hires me to organize business meetings...take care of things.

1 What?	I said just relax. I'm in full control.

1 Don't blame yourself, I didn't have to come along.	Why did you, then?
2 For you.

1 He can't help us.	Do something!
2 Do what? I don't know. I'm no good at this.	You are, I've seen you.
3 It wasn't me. It was him.	It was you.
4 He told me what to do.	But you did it. It was you.

1 Joe Doakes? It's quarter to 10...	I'm sorry. We're running behind. So many applicants...so few jobs... If you'll just have a seat.
2 I have a seat. I've had it since nine.	...Mr. Athol will be with you as soon as possible. Will you be able to wait?

1 Look, nobody knows we did it.	Whoever took it does.

1 Just ran into two of your "geologists." Geologists whose hands aren't all chewed up...?	Lowell?

1 What was that about?	Get me Wigand.
2 Sure.	...fuck is this? Fuck!

1 Are you suggesting that she and Eric are influenced by money?	Oh, no, of course they're not influenced by money. They work for free. And you are a Volunteer Executive Producer.
2 CBS does not do that. And, you're questioning our journalistic integrity?!	No, I'm questioning your hearing! You hear "reasonable" and "tortious interference." I hear... "Potential Brown & Williamson lawsuit jeopardizing the sale of CBS to Westinghouse." I hear... "Shut the segment down. Cut Wigand loose. Obey orders. And fuck off...!" That's what I hear.
3 You're exaggerating!	I am? You pay me to go get guys like Wigand, to draw him out. To get him to trust us, to get him to go on television. I do. I deliver him. He sits. He talks. He violates his own fucking confidentiality agreement. And he's only the key witness in the biggest public health reform issue, maybe the biggest, most-expensive corporate-malfeasance case in U.S. history. And Jeffrey Wigand, who's out on a limb, does he go on television and tell the truth? Yes. Is it newsworthy? Yes. Are we gonna air it? Of course not. Why? Because he's not telling the truth? No. Because he is telling the truth. That's why we're not going to air it. And the more truth he tells, the worse it gets!
4 You are a fanatic. An anarchist. You know that? If we can't have a whole show, then I want half a show rather than no show. But oh, no, not you. You won't be satisfied unless you're putting the company at risk!	C'mon, what are you? And are you a businessman? Or are you a newsman?! Because that happens to be what Mike and I do for a living...

1 You think I put that bullet in the mailbox myself...?	If we could take a look, Mr. Wigand...

1 Well, as a "standard"... I'll hang with "is the guy telling the truth?"	Well, with tortious interference, I'm afraid... the greater the truth, the greater the damage.
2 Come again?	They own the information he's disclosing. The truer it is, the greater the damage to them. If he lied, he didn't disclose their information. And the damages are smaller.
3 Is this "Alice in Wonderland"?

1 Uh, what are those boxes?	I'm going to the store. You need anything?
2 What do you need at the store?	Soy sauce...
3 Right now?	That's my stuff from the office...
4 Why did you take your stuff from the office?	I didn't want to leave it there...
5 I don't understand.	I got fired this morning... Where else am I gonna take it?
6 Why? Who said?	Thomas Sandefur...
7 What are we supposed to do...? What about our medical coverage; what about our health? What about our car payments? The payments on this house?

1 Let me see this... No, 'cause I gotta know where you're going at all times.	I can't... I've got to fly to Boston tomorrow.

1 ...you filed a lawsuit against tobacco on behalf of the State of Mississippi, did you not?	That's right...
2 Well, I'm working with someone, now, who was the former head of research at Brown & Williamson, a former corporate officer there.	What's your interest in this, Mr. Bergman?
3 Well, he may tape an interview with us. And, we believe if his testimony showed up in a court record first, it would free him up from his confidentiality agreement and give him some protection.

1 So, is everything okay?	How are the rooms? Comfortable?

1 How many shows have we done? Huh? C'mon, how many?	Oh, lots.
2 Yeah, that's right.	But in all that time, Mike, did you ever get off a plane, walk into a room, and find that a source for a story changed his mind? Lost his heart? Walked out on us? Not one fucking time! You want to know why?
3 I see a rhetorical question on the horizon.	I'm going to tell you why. Because when I tell someone I'm going to do something, I deliver.
4 Oh, how fortunate I am to have Lowell Bergman's moral tutelage to point me down the shining path. To show me the way.	Oh, please, Mike...
5 Give me a break!	No, you give me a break! I never left a source hung out to dry, ever. Abandoned. Not 'til right fucking now! When I came on this job, I came with my word intact. I'm gonna leave with my word intact. Fuck the rules of the game! Hell, you're supposed to know me, Mike. What the hell did you expect? You expect me to lie down? Back off? What, get over it?
6 In the real world, when you get to where I am, there are other considerations...	Like what? Corporate responsibility? What, are we talking celebrity here?
7 I'm not talking celebrity, vanity, CBS. I'm talking about when you're nearer the end of your life than the beginning. Now, what do you think you think about then? The future? "In the future I'm going to do this? Become that?"  What "future"? No. What you think is: how will I be regarded in the end? After I'm gone.

1 Look, I really don't have that much time...	Is there anything you want to know about me, Mr. Wigand...?
2 Like what? Your sign?

1 Talk to me outside the zone of your agreement?	Like what?
2 Like where'd you work before Brown & Williamson?	Johnson & Johnson. Union Carbide in Japan. I was general manager and director of new products. I speak Japanese. I was a director of corporate development at Pfizer. All health-related.  What else? Outside the "zone"...?
3 I don't know... you think the Knicks are gonna make it through the semi- finals?

1 You believe that?	No.
2 You should. Because when you're done, a judgment is going to go down in the court of public opinion, my friend. And that's the power you have.	You believe that?
3 I believe that? Yes, I believe that.	You believe that because you get information out to people... something happens?
4 Yes.	Maybe that's just what you've been telling yourself all these years to justify having a good job? Having status? And maybe for the audience, it's just voyeurism? Something to do on a Sunday night. And maybe it won't change a fucking thing. And people like myself and my family are left hung out to dry. Used up! Broke, alone!
5 Are you talking to me or did somebody else just walk in here?! I never abandoned a source!	I don't think you really understand --
6 No, don't evade a choice you gotta make be questioning my reputation or "60 Minutes'" with this cheap skepticism!	I have to put my family's welfare on the line here, my friend! And what are you puttin' up? You're puttin' up words!
7 Words! While you've been dickin' around at fucking company golf tournaments, I been out in the world, giving my word and backing it up with action.

1 I don't know how to say this, Jeff, except to just say it right out, so I'll say it. They do not want to air it.	What?!
2 B & W may have threatened litigation... CBS is on the block...  But you, I mean, I know how...	No.
3 No? No, what?	I do not think that you "know" for me... what it is to walk in my shoes...  ...for my kids to have seen it... for them to know why I've put them through what I did... the public airing of that... the testament to why I did what I did... you're telling me is not going to see the light of day.

1 I think I need to call the police. He won't respond...	No, no. Don't call the police!  Just tell him I'm on the phone with you... My name is Lowell Bergman... Just tell him that.

1 Jeffrey, how are you? How's the family, okay?	There is -- there is no family.
2 What do you mean there is no family?	Liane has filed for divorce...

1 Jeff's a premiere golfer... What are you, a two handicap?	Seven...
2 And, he gets out there and he has five strokes on us. He has more concentration than anybody I've ever met. It's spooky how he can concentrate.	I'd rather play than talk about it.  What did you want to see me about? I don't like being back here.

1 Course I can't do much "wriggling" if you tie me up like that again. Massey -- this is one bad bad little girl.	We'd better go before we get thrown out.

1 I am here representing Mr. Dumbarton, on a... matter of some delicacy.	Who's the pigeon?
2 Excuse me?	Who do you want me to kill?
3 Well -- I, uh, that is to say Mr. Dumbarton -- would like you to uh, neutralize a, uh, business associate by the name of Marylin Rexroth Doyle Massey uh Dumbart -- uh, Massey.	Is that... one person?
4 Here's her picture...

1 Objection, Your Honor. This isn't about Mrs. Rexroth's filial obligations.	Sustained.

1 Who was that?	That was -- oh, shit. What if he's on his way over there?
2 Huh?

1 Well. He said to "make the house mine."	Oh boy. If he only knew.
2 Yeah. I guess. You know --

1 "Who ever lov'd that lov'd not at first sight?"	You didn't ask me here to pick me up. You could get in trouble for that.
2 Not really. You're not my client. Freedom of association. Big issue with the First Amendment fans. Want to go to Hawaii for the weekend?	Have you ever been married, Miles?
3 No.	You don't believe in it.
4 As a matter of fact, I'm a huge fan.	You just haven't met the right person.
5 No. I haven't. Have you?

1 It has bones. Be sure to swallow one.	Although knowing you as I do -- there will be no settlement. This time it will be complete and total annihilation.

1 I have to say -- I'm speechless. No. I'm never speechless.	I'm a little embarrassed. I'm not used to losing control with such -- volume.
2 And I'm not used to -- Marylin -- there's something I want to ask you.	What is it Miles?
3 I want... I want to...

1 You don't like me?	I love you. I want to have your baby.
2 What's wrong Miles? Did I spend too much?

1 Nonono. Marylin -- I'm your husband. I'd be entitled to Rex's money. No matter what happened to you.	That's true.

1 I'm sorry. Where were we?	We were about to request the primary residence, and thirty percent of the remaining assets.

1 Please. I'm not seeing anyone until this is over. One husband at a time.	I wish I had your discipline.

1 Is this Ming?	It's not Ming. It's Tong.

1 So, Miles. If you have a proposal, let's hear it.	At this point my client is still prepared to consider reconciliation.
2 My client has ruled that out.	My client is prepared to entertain an amicable dissolution of the marriage without prejudice.
3 That's delusional.	My client proposes a thirty day cooling off period.
4 My client feels sufficiently dispassionate.	My client asks that you not initiate proceedings pending his setting certain affairs in order.
5 Ha Ha.	Heh heh.

1 The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves. Well, let me ask you this: what kind of settlement do you seek? What are, for you, the parameters of the possible?	That's the problem. I can't afford to give her anything.
2 Nothing?	I know that sounds rough but I'm about to close on a deal to develop some mini-malls, and I'm mortgaged up to my ass. If this deal goes south, I'm ruined -- I'll lose millions.
3 So, you propose that in spite of demonstrable infidelity on your part, your unoffending wife should be tossed out on her ear?	Well -- is that possible?

1 I tried to reach Ruth, but we couldn't get her.	We wanted Ruth here for your protection as well --
2 The Judge is here. Over here, Judge Munson.

1 I've been trying to nail George's for years, but he's very careful. I'll just keep having children. I think I'm pregnant, by the way.	Ramona! Don't get Mia Farrow on us.
2 Three is not Farrow.	Who's Rex's guy?

1 I was surprised to get your note. My daughter hadn't told me anything about you. About your helping her.	That's typical of your daughter. Takes those things for granted.  Why does she think I lugged her all the way from Miami  for the love of it?
2 Please understand me. When I say she didn't tell me anything about it, I mean not until a little while ago. She thinks you're entitled to anything you can get.	Oh, she does, huh? Isn't that sweet of her! You don't , I suppose.
3 don't know. I'd have to see on what you base your claim. I presume you feel you're justified in	If I didn't I wouldn't be here!  I've got it all itemized. 

1 A time will come when you'll thank me for this.	I won't thank you! I'll never thank you!
2 Please don't shout.	I'll shout to my heart's content! I'll scream if I want to.
3 Ah! Coconut layer cake. Nice and gooey, too. Just the way I like it.

1 It's my daughter! Go after her.	Lower the boats!

1 Never mind, son. She doesn't want it. 	But the lady says

1 That storm sure made a mess outa these roads.	Holy Smokes! You'll never get out yourself! Better phone for some help.
2 Phone for help?  We're right in the middle of nowhere. There isn't a town within ten miles of here.

1 Take my advicegrab the first bus back to Miami. That guy's a phony.	I didn't ask for your advice. 
2 That's right. You didn't.	You're not going to notify my father, are you?
3 What for?	If you play your cards right, you might get some money out of it. 
4 I never thought of that.	Listen, if you'll promise not to do it, I'll pay you. I'll pay you as much as he will. You won't gain anything by giving me away as long as I'm willing to make it worth your while. I've got to get to New York without being stopped. It's terribly important to me. I'd pay now, only the only thing I had when I jumped off the yacht was my wrist watch and I had to pawn that to get these clothes. I'll give you my address and you can get in touch with me the minute you get to New York.
5 Never mind. You know I had you pegged right from the start, you're the spoiled brat of a rich father. The only way you can get anything is to buy it. Now you're in a jam and all you can think of is your money. It never fails, does it? Ever hear of the word "Humility"? No, you wouldn't. I guess it never occurred to you to just say, "Please mister, I'm in trouble. Will you help me?" No; that'd bring you down off your high horse for a minute. Let me tell you something; maybe it'd take a load off your mind. You don't have to worry about me. I'm not interested in your money or your problems. You, King Westley, your father, you're all a lot of hooey to me.

1 Do you mind joining the Israelites?	You're not really serious about this, are you?
2 All right, don't join the Israelites. Perhaps you're interested in how a man undresses.  Funny thing about that. Quite a study in psychology. No two men do it alike. 

1 Detectives!	That's Father at work, What'll I do?  Peter, what'll I do?
2 Don't look at me. I didn't marry King Westley.

1 Peter	What?

1 I wish you wouldn't talk too much. We let a car get away. 	What if nobody stops for us?
2 Oh, they'll stop, all right. It's a matter of knowing how to hail them.	You're an expert, I suppose.
3 Expert! Going to write a book on it. Called the "Hitch-Hikers Hail."	There's no end to your accomplishments.
4 You think it's simple, huh?	Oh, no!
5 Well, it is simple. It's all in the thumb, see? A lot of people do it

1 Any luck?	Yeah. He finally agreed to let us have a room.
2 What about money?	Talked him out of it. He thinks we're going to stay a week. I'll have to think of something before morning.
3 That's swell!	I'm glad you think so. If you ask me, it's foolish. I told you there's no sense in our staying here tonight. We could make New York in less than three hours.
4 I couldn't arrive in New York at three in the morning. Everybody's in bed.	Okay.  Cottage Number Three.

1 There's a man here to see you, Sweetheart.	Whome?  Want to see me?

1 What's the matter?  Where's your husband, young lady	Husband?
2 Yesif he is your husband.	Isn't he here?
3 No, he ain't! And the car's gone, too.	Why, he'll be back.
4 Yeah? What makes you think so! He took his suitcase and everything.  Kinda surprised, huh? It's just like I told you, Zeke. They ain't married a'tall . . .

1 I'm hungry.	Just your imagination.

1 A thousand dollars!  Get out of this office before I throw you out bodily.	Don't get sore, Joe. This is something you got to do for me. I need a thousand dollarsand I need it quick. I'm in a jam.
2 What's the thousand bucks for?	To tear down the Walls of Jericho.
3 What!	Never mind . . . Listensuppose I should tell you that Ellen Andrews is going to have her marriage annulled.
4 Huh?	That she's going to marry somebody else.
5 You're drunk.	Would an exclusive story like that be worth a thousand bucks to you?
6 If it's on the level.	Well, I got it, Joe.
7 Who's she gonna marry?	It's all right here. Give me the thousand and it's yours.
8 I wouldn't trust you as far as I could throw that desk.	Wait a minute, Joe. Use your bean. I couldn't afford to hand you a phoney yarn, like that. I'd be crazy. There isn't a newspaper in the country'd give me a job after that! I could go to jail!
9 I'd put you there myself.	Sure. I wouldn't blame you, either.
10 Who's the guy she's gonna marry?	I am, Joe.
11 You!	Yeah.
12 Now I know you're drunk.  I'm going home. Don't annoy me any more.	For heaven's sake, Joestop being an editor for just a minute.  We've been friends for a long time, haven't we? You ought to know when I'm serious. This is on the level.

1 See that. They're gone!	Looks like it, don't it?  Here's the woman, ma.
2 Oh!!

1 Gee! That musta been terrible.  I guess he had it coming to him though. But don't you worry about me. I don't talk. I never talk. Take my word for it. Gee, I wouldn't want anything to happen to my kids.	Okay. Just remember that. Now beat it.
2 Oh, thanks, thanks, Mister. I always knew you guys were kind-hearted.	Come on, scram! And stay away from that bus.
3 Sure. Anything you say.

1 What was his voice like?	You knew you weren't talking to some low life fag, you know.  He had command of the king's English.
2 Did he pay?	Always - like tits on a pig.  I wish I had a million of those bimbettes.
3 And Oswald?	Like I told to the Washington boys, Bertrand called that summer and asked me to help the kid upgrade his Marine discharge...
4 So you saw Oswald how many times?	Three, four.  He came in with a few Cubano swishes one time I remember...

1 Bill.	Hey, where y'at, Frank?  You're wasting your time here.  Big Jim gave strict orders.  No FBI allowed.
2 It's you I want to talk to, Bill.	Boss would fry me in hog fat if he knew... 
3 Your boss got a serious problem, Bill.  Real serious.  We know what's been going on at your office	Yeah, I guess you do.
4 You've got nothin', Bill.  I'm talking as a friend now.  You're riding on the Titanic.  Time to jump off before you get destroyed along with Garrison.	Frank, I don't want to hear it.
5 Senator Long set your boss up, my friend.

1 ...there were about nine or ten people, Cubans, friends of Dave doing some stuff in the bush with him. Place was a mess.  Dave's mind was a mess,  Y'know he had all those mice cages around cause he's working on this cure for cancer... Dave's smart - real smart - speaks five languages, knows philosophy, medicine, military history, politics.  He wanted to be a priest but they defrocked him 'cause he was queer...	And that's where you met Oswald for the first time?
2 Yeah, strange guy.  Dave introduced him as...

1 Can you get some sworn statements?	That's gonna be tough.  Nobody's talking.
2 I think we should have him in for a little talk.

1 Nick, what would happen if a man suffering from hypertension were to take an entire bottle of Proloid?	He'd die pretty quick, either a heart storm or a ruptured blood vessel in the brain.
2 Can you ascertain if there's Proloid in his system?	Not in a routine autopsy, but if we looked at the spinal fluid, there might be a high level of iodine, but it's difficult to know.  Whatcha thinkin', Jim?
3 Well, it doesn't make sense, Nick - he was afraid of dying, then he kills himself in a way that leaves no trace, but he leaves two unsigned suicide notes.	If it's a suicide, I seen weirder, Jim. 

1 Leon's in a bad mood, don't get excited, he's all right.	Would you say this "Leon" was actually Lee Harvey Oswald?

1 I'm going to have to ask the jury to leave the courtroom.	What?

1 Finally they shuttle him to a radio factory in Minks where he lives as high on the hog as he ever has - he's given 5,000 rubles, a roomy apartment with a balcony, has affairs with local girls.	Makes sense - he's a spokesman.
2 But he never writes, speaks, or does any propaganda for the Russians.  He meets Marina, whose uncle is a colonel in Soviet intelligence, at a trade union dance; she thinks he's Russian the way he speaks, six weeks later they marry, have a daughter.

1 I'm sorry.	I know.

1 You mean you identified him on Saturday, the day before Ruby shot Oswald?	That's right.  When I saw him on TV, I was shocked.  I said to my family, "that was the man I saw in the truck."
2 But you didn't seem nearly so sure in your statement to the Warren Commission.	That's what bothers me, Mr. Garrison. You see, they've been altered.  My statements...

1 Did they live?	It's not funny, Jim, I'm scared.
2 Don't be.  Nothing to be scared about, honey, I been through four years of war - this is nothing.

1 For sexual purposes?	Well... yeah.

1 Bill, Lou, we're standing in the heart of the United States Government's intelligence community in New Orleans.  That's the FBI there, the CIA, Secret Service, ONI.  Doesn't this seem to you a rather strange place for a Communist to spend his spare time?	What are you driving at, boss?
2 We're going back into the case, Lou - the murder of the President.  I want you to take some money from the Fees and Fines Account and go to Dallas - talk to some people.  Bill, I want you to get Oser on the medical, the autopsy, Susan on Oswald and Ruby histories, tax records...

1 Time?	Between six and seven seconds.
2 The key is the second and third shots came right on top of each other, and it takes a minimum 2.3 seconds to recycle this thing.  The other problem is there was a tree right there...  Blocking the first two shots at the time they occur in the Zapruder film.	Didn't Hoover say something about that?  The leaves had fallen off in November?
3 It was a Texas Live Oak, boss.  It sheds it's leaves the first week of March.  You try to hit a moving target at 88 yards through heavy foliage with this cheap 13-dollar sucker, the world's worst shoulder weapon.  No way.  The FBI tried two sets of tests and not one of their sharpshooters could match Oswald's performance.  Not one.  And Oswald was at best a medium shot.  The scope was defective on it, too.  I mean this is the whole essence of the case to me.  The guy couldn't do the shooting.  Nobody could.  And they sold this lemon to the American public.	The Zapruder film is the proof they didn't count on, Lou.  We gotta get our hands on it.
4 That means we gotta subpoena Time- Life on it.	Why not just shoot Kennedy coming up Houston?  There's plenty of time - he's out in the open - a frontal shot?

1 Welcome, District Attorney Garrison. May I call you Jim?	I've been called everything under the sun, Jerry.  Call me whatever you like.

1 How much more?	I don't know if I should talk about this.
2 Well, I'd ask Guy - we were friendly, you know - heart attack, wasn't it?	If you buy what you read in the paper.
3 You have other information?	I didn't say that.  All I know is he died suddenly just before the Warren Report came out.
4 Why did Guy beat you, Jack?	Well, I guess now that Guy's dead, it don't really matter... it was about the people hanging around the office that summer.  I wasn't really part of the operation, you know.  I was handling the private-eye work for Guy when that came in - not much did - but that's why I was there... it was a nuthouse.  There were all these Cubans coming and going.  They all looked alike to me.

1 Well, believe what you want, boss, but we got to be more careful.  All these new volunteers, any one of them could be...	Okay, you handle it, Numa.  I don't have time for this nonsense.  We've obviously got the bastards worried now.  I'm going to Washington.

1 I'm going to be very frank with you. You've done a great job, an astounding job considering the limited resources available to you.  But the best you can ever hope for is to stir up a lot of confusion.  You're not going to do this country any good, and you're not going to do yourself any good.  You don't belong here.  On this Mickey Mouse street with that cheap strip of bail bond shops.	The job manages to keep me pretty busy.
2 Nonsense.  You should be in a job where you can make decisions that have impact, affect the world.  Here you're trying to climb up the steep side of Mount Everest.

1 Tomorrow I'll talk to your probation officer. Karen's a good kid, but she's mad at you, because you lied to her. This business about your grandmother's funeral	I went. I did. I took my mother and little brother.
2 But you didn't ask permission. You broke a trust. If you had asked, Karen probably would have let you. I'm sure she would.	I know. That's why I went.
3 But then you told her you were home.	Sure, 'cause I didn't ask her if I could go.

1 Does he have the marked bills on him?	In his inside coat pocket.

1 I doubt it.  Who's your friend?	This is Special Agent Ray Nicolet with Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. Would you mind if we looked in that bag?

1 Let me have a word outside with Agent Nicolet for a moment?	Take your time.
2 Thanks.

1 Can we stop for cigarettes?	Sure, ever been to the Riverbottom?
2 I don't think so.	It's okay. It's a cop hangout.
3 Couldn't we just stop at a seven- eleven?	I thought you might want a drink?
4 I'd love one, but not there.	We could stop at the Hilton by the airport.
5 Is it dark?	It's kind of a sports bar
6 That doesn't sound dark.	Why does it need to be dark?
7 'Cause I look like I just got outta jail, that's why. You droppin' me off at home, right? There's a place by me.	Great.

1 If you're having some.	I am. Have a seat.

1 He had his doubts at first. But he's always trusted me an wants more than anything to believe he still can.	Why?
2 He needs me. Without me all that money is just gonna sit over there in Cabo. Sugar?	No thanks. There's gotta be other ways to get it out.

1 Will Ordell go for that?	I'm helping him bring his money into America. He loves the idea. You just missed him.
2 He was here?	Yeah, we were goin' over everything. That's why all the bags.
3 I called you last night.	I know, I got your message. Ray wanted to have dinner. He wanted to talk about the sting we're plotting. That's what he calls it. A sting. He's being real nice to me.
4 You think he's got a thing for you?	Maybe. But I'm thinking it might be something like he wants the money for himself.
5 I don't follow your logic. What does his being nice to you have to do with him wanting Ordell's money?	He's setting me up to make a proposition.
6 I see.	You don't propose something like that unless you're pretty sure the other person's into it.
7 Has he hinted around?	Not really. But I knew this narcotics cop one time. Told me that in a raid, the whole package never gets back to the station. His exact words.
8 You know some interesting people.	He weren't bullshittin' either, 'cause later he was suspended and forced to retire.
9 Has Nicolet told you any colorful stories like that?

1 It'll be more than that.	Don't be so literal. Ray believed it.
2 But you still have to show him the money at the airport.	Well, you know I'm not going to show him the whole amount. He'll see fifty thousand.
3 Where's the rest of it?	In the bag underneath.
4 What if he checks it?	He won't -- I mean, he didn't the last time. He'll be expecting fifty thousand and there it is -- on top.
5 You're takin' a helluva chance kid.	Not really. If he finds it, I say Mr. Walker put the money in, and I didn't know nothing about it. Like the coke.
6 Then you're out and you get nothing.	Yeah, but I'm not in jail and I tried.
7 You're gonna have surveillance all over you.	That's why you don't make a move till I come out of the fitting room.
8 In a dress.	Well, a suit. There's one I had my eye on.

1 I didn't use you, Max.	I didn't say you did.
2 I never lied to you.	I know.
3 We're partners.	I'm fifty-five-years old. I can't blame anybody for anything I do.
4 Do you blame yourself for helping me?

1 And what would this be, Sweet and Low?	What the fuck is that shit?
2 I know what it looks like.	You planted that shit on me.

1 ...Compton with a fifty-six-year- old petty thief -- woman named Simone Hawkins.	Ever meet her, or they talk about her?
2 Not yet.	Who's the other one?
3 White girl named Melanie Ralston. Another girlfriend of Ordell's.	What's her story?
4 It was her coke I got busted with. She knows everything, but she's not part of it, and she's pissed cause she's not part of it. Ordell wouldn't even let her stay at the meeting. She tried to talk me into ripping off Ordell.	And splittin' with her?
5 I'm sure that was the idea.	What did you say?
6 I smiled and walked away. She also told me Ordell killed Beaumont.	She told you that?
7 Uh-huh.	Was she there?
8 She didn't say.	But she mentioned Beaumont by name?
9 Uh-huh.	Well, this sounds like a lady I'd like to have a word with. So everything's set for tomorrow?
10 Right. Everything's the same, except one change...

1 Killian's.	Better get me another Sam's.  Join me in a Jaeger shot?
2 Uh-uh.	Gimme one anyway.

1 Well, then, why don't you be a good hostess and make me a screwdriver?	Sure.

1 I'm tellin' you, those cops been fuckin' wit your mind. They turn black against black, that's how they do.	Shut your raggedy ass up and sit down.

1 You told them that?	It's true, isn't it?
2 What the fuck's that got to do with it?	They know I'm delivering for you. I mention the half-million -- they don't give a fuck about that -- They want you with guns. So I say, well, if you want proof he's getting paid for selling them, let me bring the money in.
3 What did they say?

1 Give it to the bail bondsman, Max Cherry. He'll take care of it.	Max Cherry? You and him friends now? You tell him about this shit?
2 He won't know where the money came from. Only that it's money.

1 That was taken at a place called "Flippers." It was in Hollywood. Were you in L.A. back then?	No.
2 Where were you?	Detroit.
3 With Ordell?	We had done time together already.

1 Jesus Christ, get a grip, Louis.	We shoulda been there already and we woulda been if it hadn't been for your fuckin' around!

1 I got me five M-60 machine guns. These came straight from the Gulf War. I sold me three of them so far, twenty grand a piece.	That's good money.
2 Louis, this is it, man. I'm gonna make me a million dollars out of this. I already got me a half-a- million sittin' in Mexico. When I do this last delivery, I'm gonna make me another half-million.	Then what?
3 I get out. Spend the rest of my life spending.

1 She tryin' to work your ass against me, ain't she?	Yep.
2 You didn't even hafta say it. I know the woman.	Well, why the fuck keep her around?
3 'Cause she my fine little surfer gal. She can't do me no harm. Fact she think she can play you against me shows how little she knows. You could teach that bitch for days how it is 'tween me an you, she never understand a damn word.	Why do you let someone know your business you can't trust?
4 I don't hafta trust her, I know her.	What does that mean?
5 You can't trust Melanie. But you can always trust Melanie to be Melanie.

1 Jesus Christ.	What?
2 You know who I saw in the dress department?	Tell me.
3 I didn't really think anything of it. No -- I did wonder what he was doing there, but didn't think it had anything to do with us. You know like maybe he was there with his wife or girlfriend.	You gonna tell me who it was?
4 Max Cherry.

1 He takes off and I gotta go to Kentucky to bring him back, you pay the expenses.	You think you could do that?

1 You know who this is?	Mister Robbie, isn't it? I have the ten thousand you put up. Isn't that why you called.

1 Get that for me, will ya baby?	You know it's for you.

1 Remember?	No! That was years ago! I've lived years since then.
2 It's all been a dream.	No! The army did this to me! They've done something to my brain.  Jezzie! I want my boys! Sarah! I'm not dead! I want my family!

1 You have an unusual hand.	I could have told you that.
2 You see this line here? It's your life line. Here's where you were born. And this is where you got married. You're a married man, huh? Oh oh. Nope. Divorce. See this split.

1 Listen, will you listen? They're trying to get me. They're comin' out of the walls. The army's done something to me. I need you.	You need ... a doctor.
2 A doctor? And what's he gonna do, tell me I'm crazy? They've fucked with my head. I've got to prove it. You've got to do something.

1 Not me, buddy.	Okay, not you Rod. But the rest of us are flipping out for some goddamn reason. They're tryin' to kill us. Fuck it man, we need to find out what's going on.

1 And how is your wife? Sarah, no?	I haven't seen her in months.
2 Ah!	I'm with another woman now. We're both with the post office, Midtown, 34th Street branch.
3 Hmm. I don't suppose there are too many philosophers in the post office?	Oh, you'd be surprised. They just don't have their doctorates, that's all.
4 Last I heard you were offered a posi- tion in the West somewhere. Tuscon was it?	Oh, that goes way back. They had a hiring freeze, one of those last min- ute things. Bad timing for me though. Middle of the war. The draft.  I'll tell you Prof, after Viet Nam ... I didn't want to think anymore. I decided my brain was just too small an organ to comprehend this chaos.
5 Jacob, if it was any other brain but yours, I might agree.  Tell me, does your lady friend know what a brilliant thinker, what a sub- lime intellect she's living with?	I doubt it's my mind that interests her. I tell you Prof, she's a fiery lady.
6 Well, try not to get burned. You have a great mind, Jacob. Don't let anyone tempt you away from it.

1 I'm not dead. I am not dead.	No. Of course you're not. You've just hurt your back. That's all. You're going to be fine. It'll just take some time.

1 Thanks.  What's that?	Your kid dropped it off.
2 Who? Jed?	No. The little one.
3 Eli. Why can't you remember their names?	They're weird names.
4 They're Biblical. They were prophets.	Well, personally, I never went for church names.
5 And where do you think Jezebel comes from?	I don't let anybody call me that.
6 You're a real heathen, you know that, Jezzie? Jesus, how did I ever get involved with such a ninny?	You sold your soul, remember? That's what you told me.
7 Yeah, but for what?	A good lay.
8 And look what I got.	The best.
9 I must have been out of my head.	Jake, you are never out of your head!
10 What's in here?	Pictures. Your wife was gonna toss 'em so "what's his name" brought 'em over on his way to school.

1 You okay?	I wanna leave. Get me out of here.
2 Oh, come on. It's early.	Where are we?
3 We're at Della's.	Where?
4 What do you mean? Where do you think?	Where's Della? Bring her here?
5 Why? What for?	Show me Della!
6 Hey, I'm here.

1 Help me! Help me!	Here. I'll do it.

1 Who was that?	A chemist. Part of a chemical warfare unit out of Saigon. He said he knows me and that I'll know him when I see him.
2 How?	I have no idea.  I was right. There were experiments. I knew it. I knew it. My God.
3 How do you know he's telling the truth?

1 It's going to be all right, Jake. It's going to be all right. Don't be afraid. I've got you now.	Hold me, Jezzie. Hold me.

1 None of us can remember that night. I get flashes of it but they don't make sense. We saw shrinks for years. But nothing they did could ever touch it. What happened? Was there ever an offensive?	A couple of days later. It was fierce. You guys never saw it.
2 But there was an attack. I can still see them coming. There was a fight, wasn't there?	Yeah. But not with the Cong.
3 Who then?

1 How 'bout over there?  No wait. Do me a favor. Bring 'em to the back room.	They're awfully heavy.
2 I know. That's why I'm asking.

1 Well, don't we look better this morning? That was a hard night, wasn't it?	Where am I?
2 Lennox Hospital.	I'm awake?
3 You look awake to me. Here.  Drink some of this.	Where's Sarah? Where did she go?  She was here ...
4 No. No. You haven't had any visitors.	That's a lie. My family was here.
5 I'm sorry.	Last night! They were as real as you are!

1 Can I help you?	I'm looking for Dr. Carlson. Isn't this his office?

1 I don't have all day, kid.	Yeah yeah I better call the labs, see what the hell is going on.

1 Can we blow it with just two?	If we don't sever the hull completely she'll drag us down with her.

1 Sergeant!	Get out of here!

1 Shit!	The hull's imploding!
2 Rizzo! Can you hear me?!

1 We'd need charges.	We could convert fission transistors.

1 Get them in the lab!	Not so fast Yllo! There's a protocol here.

1 Ok Sarge, what's your status?	wHAT'S My status?! I've lost three men and your worthless fuck! After I kill this asshole I'm coming your Yllo!
2 But I didn't see...

1 Kicker, anything?	Negative.

1 Kkinsa, open the goddamn door!	Yeah, that's it, scare the hell out of here, that'll work.

1 They were all wrong. They couldn't control him.	And what happend to ...?

1 Rizzo, pull away!	I'm stuck!

1 Now hold on! We should hear her out!	She's obviously dealt with this guy before.

1 Push off toward us.	Forget her, she's a pain in the ass. Let her hang there.

1 Oh my God . . . what the hell is . . .	Just get us to the ship!

1 Jesus!	Oh my God! Adrienne?

1 I'm surrounded by idiots.	You need to get laid!

1 Do I have to?	Yes, I've reprogrammed you. You are very brave. Bad ass.
2 Oh, alright.

1 What?	Ssh.

1 Now lay back we need to do some tests and I have some questions...	JASON?! WHERE IS HE?!

1 It's okay, he just wanted his machete.	Three...two...one...

1 You're not going to the ocean with that, are you son?	I'm all checked out for light surf and look at it.
2 Do me this favor just once. Use the ponds.	Dad, the ponds are for old ladies.
3 Just a favor for your old man.	Sure, Dad.

1 How -- if they're gonna keep on breaking?	What I do is trick him to the surface, got that? Then I can jab him, understand?  Think I'm gonna haul it in as if he's a catfish, like everyone else does?

1 He can't stay down with three barrels on him! Where is he?!	Have you ever had one do this?
2 No!

1 Be careful.	Here? You gotta be kiddin'.

1 Colorful, isn't he?	You going to be all right?
2 Nothing to worry about -- I'll survive this.	I'll see you back soon. There's an extra pair of glasses in your black socks, and there's some suntan lotion and blistex in your kit.

1 Why not, Larry? We could get a positive confirmation that way.	Be reasonable, boys -- this isn't the time or the place to do some kind of half-assed autopsy on a fish. Ben...  do you have all the pictures you need?

1 Dynamite!  How was your day...?	Swell.

1 He didn't have a dinghy aboard. I'm going down to take a look at his hull.	Why don't we just tow it in?
2 We will. There's something I've got to find out.	Be careful, for chrissake.

1 Quint...?	No...  You think we can get back with those?

1 I'd like to tell you what we're doing so far. These are some of the steps I've taken as Chief of Police...	What's going on with the beaches, Chief?

1 ...push this? Oh. It's working. Hello, Martin?	This is Quint, Missus.
2 I just wanted to know if you were all right... the Coast Guard let me use their radio. Is Chief Brody there?	He's busy.
3 Well... is everything all right?	Just fine, Missus. We'll be back soon. Everything's fine. We haven't seen anything yet. Orca out.

1 Watch it! Compressed air -- you screw around with one of those and Boom! Careful, huh?	Real fine stuff but it won't mean a thing to Mr. Whitey, of course... he didn't go to schools in electronics. He was born with what he does best. Eat. He's a swimming appetite. 'Course he might eat this stuff, but then I've seen him eat a rocking chair, too.  Next time, ask me.

1 Bull shark scraped me while I was taking samples...	Nothing! A pleasure scar. Look here --

1 I'm sorry, Martin. She's in a sick, terrible state.	Look, maybe this is the wrong time to pursue this, but I'm not sure...

1 Oh, I couldn't copy your work.	But you copy my work every week.
2 Oh yeah. I'm kind of a deadbeat lab partner, huh?	I don't mind. You definitely bring something to the table.
3 Charisma?	Or something.

1 We're getting a stretch limo.	Your mom must be really glad you're not taking me.
2 You're mad. Why are you mad?	I'm not mad. I'm in a fucking great mood. Despite the fact that I'm trapped in a fat suit I can't take off, despite the fact that everyone is making fun of me behind my back, despite the fact that your little girlfriend gave me the stinkeye in art class yesterday...
3 Katrina's not my girlfriend! And I doubt she was actually giving you the stinkeye. She just looks like that all the time.

1 They could be utterly negligent. Maybe they'll do a far shittier job of raising a kid than my dumbass stepdaughter ever would. Have you considered that?	No... I guess not.
2 What is your job title, exactly?	Excuse me?
3 I said, what-is-your-job-title, Missy?	I'm an ultrasound technician, ma'am.
4 Well I'm a nail technician, and I think we both ought to stick to what we know.	What are you talking about?
5 You think you're special because you get to play Picture Pages up there?

1 We don't even have a dog!	Yeah, because you're allergic to their saliva. I've made a lot of sacrifices for you, Juno. And in a couple years you're going to move out -- and I'm getting Weimaraners.
2 Wow, dream big!	Oh, go fly a kite.

1 Whoah. I don't want to see pictures. I don't need to be notified of anything. Can't we just kick it old school? I could just put the baby in a basket and send it your way. You know, like Moses in the reeds.	Technically, that would be kickin' it Old Testament.

1 Behold, good sir! The very first photo of your future child.	You're kidding!

1 Juno was nice enough to bring this by for us.	I came over as soon as I got that cold ultrasound goo off my pelvis. My stepmom verbally abused the ultrasound tech so we were escorted off the premises.

1 Wow, I actually feel like less of a fat dork now.	Most Fruitful Yuki is bad ass, man. You should be proud to be the same condition.

1 Can I take your coats?	Sure.

1 Oh my God...	Doesn't it look like it's waving? It's kind of like it's saying "Hi, Vanessa. Will you be my mommy?"
2 Yeah. Yeah, it kind of does.

1 Hi. I'm here for the big show?	Your name, please?
2 Juno MacGuff.

1 Damn skippy, you're not! You don't even remember to give Liberty Bell her breathing meds.	Once! And she didn't die, if you recall!

1 So what's the prognosis, Fertile Myrtle? Minus or plus?	I don't know. It's not... seasoned yet. Wait. Huh. Yeah, there's that pink plus sign again. God, it's unholy.

1 Best to just tell them, man. Rip off the Band-Aid and let it bleed.	I'm pregnant.

1 God, you're getting huge. How many months has it been now?	Almost eight. You wouldn't believe how weird I look naked.
2 I wish my funbags would get bigger.	Trust me, you don't. I actually have to wear a bra now. And I have to rub this nasty cocoa butter stuff all over myself or my skin could get stretched too far and explode.
3 Hot!

1 What do you think? Custard or Cheesecake?	They're yellow.
2 Well, I wanted to pick something gender-neutral for now. Once we get the baby, God willing, we can create a more decisive palette.	Why do people think yellow is gender- neutral? I don't know one man with a yellow bedroom.
3 I think I'm leaning toward Custard in this light. I don't know. I should paint a small area...	Or you could just wait a couple months. It's not like the baby's going to storm in here any second and demand dessert-colored walls.
4 What to Expect says that readying the baby's room is an important process for women. It's called "nesting."	Nesting, huh? Are you planning to build the crib out of twigs and saliva?
5 You should read the book. I even flagged the "daddy chapters" for you.	I just think it's too early to paint. That's my opinion.
6 And I disagree.

1 You lose!	I suppose anything's possible.

1 Early don't think women should smoke or curse or drink liquor.	So you don't do any of those things.

1 My momma's a beautician. Guess that's where I get it from. She wouldn't hear of my moving in with Early... on account of his just getting out of jail and all. Ain't seen her in nearly a year now. I wish she'd call me, just once.	What's Early been in jail for?
2 Carryin' a gun.	...Anything else?
3 An' resistin' arrest... At least that's what the Police said.	Jeez... Adele!

1 Did you settle things with Mr. Diebold?	Yeah I left him with the car... We're all squared up now.

1 Oh, n'jus what in hell you crying 'bout? I'm the one got hit.	I changed my mind, Early. I'm not gonna climb up that Hollywood sign with you... I decided. I think your mean, and you hurt people.

1 This the book your writing?	It's just a work in progress, kinda rough.
2 This guy killed a mess of people.	Who?
3 Henry Lucas.	Henry Lee Lucas. Well he was only convicted of killing eleven but he claimed to have killed over three hundred.
4 Wonder what all them people done made him so mad?

1 So tell me... what happened here?	Two brothers, prospectors, lived here. Up until a few years back.

1 So how's it going?	...I think it's the best stuff I've done.

1 ...And all I'm saying is I think we ought to try and get along with them. That's all.	You try, I'm gonna pretend they're with somebody else.
2 Carrie.	I don't want to talk about it.

1 Carrie... stop it.	What the fuck is wrong with you Brian!? If you'll stop taking notes for once and open your eyes... you'll see that he is a homicidal fucking killer. He is... for real!
2 Shut up Carrie, please... just shut up!

1 Sometimes... Don't know why it is... I get so hot I can't stand it. I just start sweating like a dog. You ever get like that?	No.

1 ...The police were way out of line when they stopped you from beating that bartender half to death. And no doubt God'll be pickin' on you on Judgement Day...	I ain't got nothing against God. It's the people he let come into the world... lot of them should have been stopped at the door. What are you looking for?

1 What do you think?	You fucked it?

1 Telly.	Yeah.
2 Did she suck your dick?	A little bit. But I didn't really want her to.
3 Why?	I don't know. That's too easy. I mean getting a virgin to suck your dick. That's so easy.
4 It is right.	I want to knock her guard down. I mean there's a whole philosophy behind it. Having a virgin suck your dick, that's basic because there's nothing lost.
5 It's no big deal, right?	Right. But when you deflower a girl, that's it. You did it. You were the one. No one else can ever do it.
6 Yeah. The way I see it. My outlook on the this situation is.  It's like getting fame, you know what I'm saying. It's like, if you died tomorrow, and fifty years from now all the virgins you fucked are gonna remember you because you were their first.	Yep.
7 They're gonna tell their grand kids.  That Telly. He sure was good in the sack!

1 You wanna run by the park and see what everybody's doing? Get zooted?	I guess so. I gotta stop off home too.

1 Nah.	Why not? You stink.
2 That shit gives me a rash all under my arms and around my stomach. I like my odor. It's fuckin' natural.

1 Sup. Sup.	Come on nigga. Sup, sup then? Stop faking moves.
2 I'm gonna fuck you up bitch.

1 Uh huh.	I think you're like the best girl I've ever kissed.

1 You know it won't hurt. I'll be gentle. I promise.	Do you care about me?
2 Of course I do.

1 Miss, would I be prying?	Everything is wrong.
2 No, not everything? The sun is still shinning. It's a beautiful day out. Some things are OK. Right?	Yeah, I guess so.
3 Did you and your boyfriend just break up?	No.
4 Are you in trouble with the law?	No.
5 Am I getting warm?

1 Like where are your erogenous zones?	Mine?
2 Mine are like my neck and my chest.

1 Yeah. And sex is just like, yeah let's have sex.	It's like yeah whatever. But when you fuck. You wanna fuck that person. You're like ripping each other's hair out. Ooooh.

1 I made her get tested with me because I didn't want to go alone.	Did they ask you a lot of questions?

1 So, how many people live here now?	I don't know, eight or nine.
2 Where does everyone sleep?	Everywhere. Fuckin' flophouse. We're still short on the rent. If you want, you and Casper can move in. You guys can share the bathtub.

1 By yourself?	Yes.

1 You don't tell us how to run our investigation.  You got that?	You don't have an investigation without me.  You got that?

1 The message!  I figured out--	Sit down!

1 You still having a problem with this?	Yeah, I am.  I think he's playing us. If I was a killer and the police were trying to make a case against me, what better why to draw them off than to put their attention on someone else?

1 It doesn't make sense because we don't understand it.	But a hundred men could move him.

1 Hello?	Do you know what I'm doing right now, Peter?  I'm looking at the name of the girl I'm going to kill tonight.
2 You know her?	Not really.
3 Why her?	Because she's the type.
4 But you said you didn't know her.	I know what I said!  She looks just like...
5 Just like who?	I really wish you'd stop trying to maneuver me.  I find it irritating, not to mention insulting.
6 I'm just trying to play the game.	You're not playing very well.  There are clues all around you and you keep missing them.

1 Hello, Peter.	You sonofabitch!
2 Emotional?  I expected more from you.	If you kill tonight and I'm in jail the police will know I'm innocent.
3 By that time the game will be over.	I've figured out the message.
4 No you haven't.  And even if you had it doesn't matter.  Who would you tell? The police don't believe you, and you've just used your only phone call.

1 Sure.  We've got a modem line hooked up with the data base in New York.	Can we correlate data?  Look for specific things, like player's ages... stuff like that?
2 No problem.  We're in.	Okay.  Run a search to see if there are any players with a rating above two thousand that live on the Island.

1 Feeling better?	I just can't believe it.
2 You don't want to believe it.  It's a normal reaction.	How come the police never had a record of Sanderson before.  This doesn't come out of nowhere, there has to be a history.

1 What are you doing up?	I can't sleep.  My beds lumpy.
2 I see.  You forgot to bring you're night-light, didn't you?	That has nothing to do with it.
3 You want to sleep in my bed tonight?	Okay.

1 This is where he forced his way in.  We found some fibers on the windowsill, probably particles of clothing that rubbed off when he climbed through. I'll know more once I get it under the microscope.	That's great.
2 Wait, I've saved the best for last. Andy, hit the lights, will you?

1 His home would be... Mount Olympus.	Call dispatch.  Double the patrols.  I want that area blanketed.

1 And what if he's wrong.  If you were one hundred percent sure it was Peter you would've arrested him.  If it is someone else then he's going to kill again tonight and you're sitting here ignoring the message.	We're going to work on the message.
2 This stinks!  You want to know what I think?  I think there have been five murders and you've got shit to go on. You need to blame someone and he's the easiest choice.	The most logical choice.
3 You don't have a shred of evidence!

1 What have you come up with on the riddle?	"Wee Willie Winkie runs though the street."  We think he might be making a reference to himself.
2 Maybe, but I don't think so.  I think it's just a tease.	Upstairs and downstairs in his night gown -- He could be saying the house he's picked is two stories.

1 Where were you last night?	Are we going to go through this again?
2 Answer the question.	I went out.

1 What do you see here?	Mate in five.
2 Exactly... and you did this.

1 What are you looking for?	Nothing.  I just came in for a steam.
2 No you didn't.

1 I know you didn't	You know, Andy thinks you're doing this.
2 Doesn't that scare you?	No.
3 Why?	Because I think he's wrong.

1 Did you call?	The line was busy.  I'll try again.

1 If we could just figure out what the next word is going to be.  He said the game's going to end tonight so there's only going to be one more word.	It could be anything.
2 It's got to be grammatically correct.

1 I don't trust you to wash behind your ears.	Never mind my ears! Go away!

1 Yes.	Move quickly. We are coming for you. We are in the Fortress.
2 I knew you would come.

1 But it opens onto the sheer wall of the Needle. There's no way down.	You have rope?
2 I am too old to climb down a rope.	You won't have to.

1 Traitor! She'll marry you in hell!	He thinks you betray him with Lyssa.  Colwyn! The waters deceive you!

1 Slayers!	We must enter the swamp.

1 I just remembered I have urgent business in this direction.	What business?
2 Staying alive.

1 I'm not hungry.	Not sleepy, either?
2 No.

1 Make for the wall. I'll catch up.	Colwyn, don't be a fool. You can't do battle with that thing.
2 There's no way to outrun it. You know that. This is what Ynyr was preparing me for. It's what he died for.

1 I'm hungry.	Smart lad.  Bring me my spices!

1 Passable, pimple, very passable.	The greatest boon of your otherwise worthless life, blockhead, is the privilege of dining on boar roasted by the hand of Ergo the Magnificent.
2 Your boast is a bigger mouthful than your roast, Magnificence.

1 He will come for me.	He will not come. You will be my queen.

1 Can you see?	Yes. It is the Western Ocean.

1 I'll stay behind and keep them busy.	It is not necessary. They will not follow.

1 I cannot stop the sand.	You cannot stop time. Go now, before it runs out.
2 You will come with me.	There is sand enough for only one life. Go now, save the other.

1 Why can't I have a bank account?	I'll explain you, Leon: they'll ask you to fill in a lot of forms and you can't write and they'll ask you your job, your employer's name and you can't tell them: My job, I'm a hitman and my employer is Tony, his record is longer than his resturant's menu.  That's why you can't have a bank account!

1 What's up? I don't feel you're concentrated.	Yes, yes...

1 Not taken.	Why?
2 Too heavy.

1 Mathilda, hadn't you told that bullshit to the receptionist, we'd still be in the hotel, I make you notice.	That wasn't bullshit, I said we love each other.
2 Yeah!... Anyway, I don't like hotels. Too much people, everyone's got the key... I don't like it.

1 ...No...	...Don't you like me?

1 Yes?	Good morning, Mister... It's Danielle!
2 Huh! You made an error, baby.  I don't know any Danielle.	...I got lost, Mister.
3 Huh? Move back, baby, I can't see anything.	It's not me, it's dark here... and I can't find the switch.

1 Is he still alive?	Yeah... And still in Messina.  He's my uncle.
2 Huh? Are you Alfredo's son, then?	No... Dino's.

1 Uncle Maurice, you're wearing sneakers?	High-top Nike Cross-Trainers with heel support and air-cushioned soles.  They're nasty.

1 What would you like us to do?	Put out a P.B.S.... Or whatever it's called.
2 A.P.B.... He isn't breaking any law.  He's a grown man... He can crawl on his hands and knees to China if that's what he wants to do.	Sergeant, I'm a psychologist and I know the difference between normal whims people have and actions that clearly display psychological problems... My uncle lost his wife and it devastated him.
3 We're very sorry about that.  Some of our men were on the scene of the accident.	I think my uncle is suffering from a condition called Mania which is linked with depression.  It is a time when an individual will act over-confident, and will act out impractical, grandiose plans. Sometimes these plans can be dangerous.
4 How long does this... Mania last?	A couple days to a few months if untreated.

1 I know what you're getting at.	You do?
2 I've seen it before.	You have?
3 You're feeling old and you want to start exercising.  A lot of men your age feel the need to recapture their youth.  Don't feel embarrassed about it.	Okay.
4 You should start slow and easy -- fifteen minutes a day.	No.  How far in one attempt -- what's the farthest someone like myself could walk?

1 Why do you polish that thing all the time?	You're talking to me?
2 Why do you polish it?

1 Your father?	He's plastered.
2 That's okay -- really it is.	No it's not.  He should be here with me now, not trying to find some fucking bottle of Johnny Walker.  He's never been there for me.  I've always been alone.

1 What's his story?	His name is Maurice.  He's dancing around everything else.
2 Red flag, man.	If he's in trouble with the law -- fine.  Not our problem.  He yanked two people from a car wreck, let's give him some space.

1 There was a boy named Isaac who wanted to play baseball, but he was too small and no one would let him play... but he kept practicing by himself -- waiting... He went to every game and sat in the stands with his glove.	You know what... maybe I ran onto the field and hit a home run.
2 Who's telling this story?

1 What happened?	Never have children.  If they're not a burden to you, they're a burden to someone else.

1 I'm really lost.  What does this have to do with walking?	I said, 'I would do anything for her'... and she didn't believe me. I said, 'I'd walk across the country for her'... she didn't believe me.

1 Mr. Parker, you can yell at me, if it'll help.  But I'm not risking your life.	It's mine to risk.

1 You look so happy -- how long have you been married?	Forty-seven years.

1 Isn't it illegal to drink and drive?	That's funny.  I wonder if you'll take two hundred and fifty dollars to fuck me?

1 No, I came here to drink... myself... you know...	To death?
2 Yes, that's right.

1 I'm rambling. I really like you. You make me want to talk... I don't know what time it is.	I like hearing you talk.  If you feel up to a short walk, there's a place to eat around the corner. All the food in Vegas is terrible so the place doesn't really matter. How does that sound to you?
2 Do they have drinks?

1 Want a drink? Great nap. Wanna go out tonight?	Seriously, Ben... I need to keep pretty low-key around here. Maybe next time you could nap this side of the door. That was the landlord.
2 Of course.

1 How are you doing?	Very well... umm... I never expected to have to ask you this again... but how did our evening go? I remember getting to the casino... I remember kissing you... that was really nice but everything after that is a blank.
2 Well -- I was prepared for worse, but it wasn't so bad. We were sitting at the bar, talking about blackjack. You seemed just fine, a little drunker than usual, but nothing really strange, but then your head started to droop and I put my arm on your shoulder and then, wham, you swung you arm at me, and fell backwards off your stool into a cocktail waitress. You smashed everything on her tray, it was a real mess. You kept yelling and yelling.	Oh, and what did you do?
3 I tried to shut you up and help you to your feet but you kept swinging at me -- not like you wanted to hit me, but more just waving me away. Security came and when you saw them you stopped yelling. They wanted to carry you out and dump you on the street, but I talked them into letting me walk you out.	That's impressive. How did you do that?
4 I told them you were an alcoholic and I would take you home. I also promised that we would never come in there again.	We?

1 I like it here with you.	Let's stay for a while.
2 OK.

1 Please don't raise your voice. I won't bother you about it again.	Sorry. Look... you seem like a nice girl. I'm just sick of everyone in this town trying to get my money.

1 Have you told anyone that I'm here?	No.

1 I'm a Delta Gamma and I'm a huge fan of yours!	You took my class in LA. You had the best high kick I've ever seen. Are you one of my lawyers?
2 Sort of.

1 Did you hear a shot fired?	No. I was in the shower.
2 So at some point in the -- twenty minutes you were in the shower, your father was shot?	I guess.

1 Did you get it?	Yes. But I can't tell you what it is.

1 What did you see when you entered the house?	I saw Mrs. Windham standing over the body of Mr. Windham.
2 Was she carrying a weapon?	No, she was crying her eyes out.

1 You can't even imagine.	Spill.

1 Good one.	Trust me. You've got the equipment, you just need to read the manual.

1 Donovan asked to see you before you leave.	Really?
2 He's already got his coffee -- maybe he needs a donut.

1 Honey, stop! You have to leave this room -- it's been a week.	So?

1 You have Stromwell.	Did she do that to you, too?
2 No, but she made me cry once. Not in class -- I waited until I got to my room, but yeah, she can pretty much shrivel your balls -- or you know, your whatevers.	Neat.
3 Don't worry. It gets better. Who else do you have?

1 Mrs. Windham Vandermark?	We're here from Austen, Platt, Jaret & Donovan --

1 Hey --	I'm quitting.

1 Girls -- I'm going to Harvard!	What, like on va-kay?

1 Maiden name -- Daniels.  You know her?	She was a Delta Gamma! Not in my pledge class or anything -- she graduated five years ahead of me. But I used to take her class at the LA Sports Club. She's amazing!

1 Elle, believe me, I never expected to be doing this, but I think it's the right thing to do.	How can it be the right thing if we're not together?
2 I have to think about my future. And what people expect from me.	So you're breaking up with me because you're afraid your family won't like me?  Everybody likes me!
3 East coast people are different.	Just because I'm not a Vanderbilt, all of a sudden I'm white trash? I grew up in Bel Air, Warner! Across the street from Aaron Spelling! I think most people would agree that's way better than a Vanderbilt --
4 I told you, Elle. I need someone -- serious.	I'm seriously in love with you -- Isn't that enough?

1 Pink ones.	See?

1 Is it a Kappa?	It's not a Theta --

1 You go?  Not watch fun?	I have something far more pleasant awaiting me.

1 When the time's come, you won't need to jump, I'll throw you out myself!	Do it now!
2 No.  Now is the time for discipline. Some lessons in obedience for the future Baroness.

1 No, wait... please... listen...	No more listening!  Your time is at an end, insignificant whelp!

1 Elderberry wine.  No finer drink under heaven.	It looks... er, delicious...  Such a fine bouquet... very aromatic...
2 Are ye afraid of me wine?  Did your momma tell ye never to take food nor drink from the Wee Folk?  Think if ye sup with the faeries you'll be enchanted?	Well... I... I don't want to be rude, but... it's generally known that --
3 Generally known!  What general ever knew more than to lace up his boots?	Please don't misunderstand.  I am grateful for your hospitality and --
4 He is afraid of enchantment!  Will you listen to the fool prattle on.

1 There be no finer victuals than worm flesh, lad.	Better we eat him than the other way round.

1 How do we follow a raven we can't even see?	Send Oona up above the tree tops. She be our eyes.
2 Good plan that.

1 Shhh!  Not so loud, mayhap he'll hear ye.	Dwarves be very sensitive about their feet.
2 Certainly understandable.	Very secretive, they are.  Keep their feet covered up.  Best if you don't mention it.

1 Is she... dead?	No, thank the Lord, but she be sore envenomed by the spider's bite.
2 We're blind now.  Oona was our eyes and ears.  How do we find the Castle Couer de Noir without her?	We'll find it.
3 Easily said... the raven passed this way hours ago.	Heading true north.  We continue in that direction.
4 Never knowing when it takes a turn or changes course.	We'll trust in faith, Gump.
5 Aye, lad... we've little else to go by.

1 Tells you something 'bout him what lives there...	We'll need more siege machinery and longer scaling ladders.
2 Why not mine the damned walls?	We do both.  Our frontal attack a diversion whilst we drive a tunnel under...

1 Will you explain what's going on?	Patience, lad.

1 Keep me belly full, Jack.  Kill us another worm.	Hush up, Screwball.  Do your own worm-sticking if you like the taste so well.
2 Nay.  Jack's the dragon-slayer, ain't you, Jack.

1 Aye... my Lord...	Rise, Screwball, and into the basket with you.

1 How much longer?	Shhh!
2 I am a princess.  You have no right to order me about.	In these woods you are a commoner. Now be quiet.  True royalty approaches.

1 No!  I won't let it happen...	You've freed me, Jack...
2 It's the Baron's damnable work!  Too cowardly to stand and fight... he used you to save himself.	No... it's not you he's afraid of, it's... light...
3 What?	Sunlight... It destroys him.
4 Sunlight?	That's why he goes masked during the day...
5 So, he's hiding in the dark...	In the dark... where I join him...
6 No!  Don't let go... you mustn't!  I love you!	And I... love you...

1 Here be the death weapon; the unicorn's blood dry upon it.	Couer de Noir!  A demon if the Devil ever made one.
2 He chopped off the horn and left the rest to rot.	That would be the Baron's way. There'll be no light or life in the world until the alicorn is taken from him and he vanquished.
3 How do I get the horn back?	You'll need the fastest steed alive, for Couer de Noir's castle rests at the very edge of the earth.  Only the sharpest sword and the golden armor of Achilles will protect you from his fury.
4 Where do I find the Baron's castle?	Follow the raven in her flight, Follow old black wing to the edge of night...
5 Not very precise directions.	Come sit beside me, sweet boy, and I'll draw you a map.
6 Nay.  Tempting as your invitation be.  Tell me one thing more.	Ask away, sweet man.
7 What became of the princess?	Princess?  I know of no princess.
8 Princess Lili, Godwin's daughter. She was with me when calamity struck, but after I could find no trace of her.	Is she fair, this princess?
9 Exceeding fair.	As fair as me?
10 Twould be to compare one star with another in the summer sky.	She's dead!
11 No!	Dead, dead, dead.
12 I don't believe you.	Far as you're concerned she's dead, believe it or not.

1 Is this a May Day pageant?  Are you all off on a lark...?  The raven passed this way hours ago!	Heading north still?
2 True north...  Straight up that pass, through the net.

1 Maybe there's a better idea... What about birds... get a lift from some friendly bird...	Haven't heard a bird sing in days...
2 Or a kite...!  We could make a kite... Let the wind do the work --

1 Is he a friend, then?	Yes, yes... Jimmy Squarefoot good friend to one and all...

1 And we got to take all the old paint off all the doors and then George taught us how to stain everything and he even let me choose the color I liked best!  And he said he loved me!	We did a lot of the wiring too.
2 With Dale.  Oh, and I got to drill a hole into a board to put the wire through!

1 So put your plans of my room in the trash.	I don't think Dad wants you home.

1 Atonement.	Who are all these people?

1 Did you feel anything?	Maybe your tongue...I don't know, my mouth is numb.  Why did you do that?

1 Huh?	I can use your mom's.
2 I'm okay.

1 You hate your father.	If he tricked me into loving him, is what I meant.
2 You'd hate him for the trick.	Not if what he left me was real.

1 Funny how he's the architect and you're just a loud mouth cop.	He builds models for architects.  His dad, on the other hand, was the real deal.  Designed and built the coolest houses I've ever seen.

1 Right...she married...what was he?	He buys and sells the world.
2 Peter Webber!  Right.  Quite the spotlight on that guy.	I did tell you, didn't I?  That I'd be ready to start the Berlin model today?
3 Well, that's sort of...you're sure you're not hungry?

1 Sam?	Uh huh.
2 I didn't recognize you!	I'm sorry.
3 Alyssa said you don't even have plumbing over there.	Not a shower.

1 Your mom and the boys can drop by anytime.	To check up on me?
2 I'll be around to check up on you.	Why would you be there?
3 Because I live there.	You live in Cory's parents' cabin?

1 I hate turkey.	No you don't.

1 Oh, so you're in the big shit now!  Child abuse.  People go to prison for what you just did to me.	My dad used to play a game.  I never really understood what it was until after he was gone.

1 Are you talking?	I was just thinking about my mom.  She wouldn't leave him.  I remember one time she made us dinner wearing sunglasses.  I mean it was dark outside and in.  But we never talked about it.
2 Sun glasses?	To hide a black eye.
3 Why wouldn't she leave?	I think she was terrified of living with him...but maybe even more terrified of life without him.
4 I would have killed him.	Everything would have been better if you had.  You'd have liked your grandmother. And there'd be a girl out there that'd have her mother.  I remember reading about her in the paper.  They couldn't find her father and her mother was dead. I still feel guilty about that.
5 Do you ever wish you had done it?

1 I'd eat a lot of red meat.	Good for you.

1 Mr. Dokos called to complain that you and a boy are squatting illegally in the garage of your house.	Check the permits.  It was built as a guesthouse.  It's a legally rentable unit grandfathered when South Laguna was incorporated.

1 He never answers.	Why does he have a lock on his door?
2 Because he put the lock on!  Do you think I told him he could have a nose ring?! Why do you ask me everything you should ask him!?  I don't know anything, anymore!

1 We're fine.  Turkey sandwiches.	Well, for later then.

1 I thought you'd be up with the sun.	My stupid back.

1 Do you know Alyssa thinks something is up with us?  She's giving me crap about being away from Peter and now you're trying to do the same thing!  What no one seems to realize is that Peter isn't there!  He's not there!  And when he is, he isn't!  So, if you don't want me here, or you don't want my kids here, just tell me, George.  I'll stop coming.  But it won't be because of Peter.  It'll be because you asked me to stop.  Say what you need to say, because I'm not leaving until I hear it.	I'd rather you not be here.

1 I better get the kids home.	Not a perfect day.

1 We've eaten.	Is Lois still here?  I'm starved.
2 I'll make you something.

1 That sounds pathetic, doesn't it?	What are you doing home?
2 I always felt I could never marry you without first showing you what a fabulous life you cloud live despite me.

1 I've missed you guys.	Why?

1 Ryan, would you rather swim or work?	Can we really help build a house?

1 These are free papers.	What am I gonna do out there, Ray? I can't go home to my mama like this. I'll get the strap for sure.
2 Come on, Biscuit, this is good news. Your mama's gonna break down in tears when you show up on her doorstep.

1 Forty years. That's a long time for any crime, even murder.	It's a hell of a lot longer when you're innocent.
2 Half the men in this prison swear they're innocent. Don't you think that's kinda funny?	You have to forgive me if I don't laugh.

1 Season tickets to the Yankees. Right there on the first base line.  What's wrong, baby?	I was hoping you were gonna say an engagement ring, Claude.

1 What I want to know is what happened to your cush between the time that you got up from the table and when I caught up with you in the Johnny?	I don't see where that's any of your business.
2 Did those two muscle heads shake you down? Swear I've seen them down at the track with Sure-shot Riley. That's it, ain't it? A gambling debt.

1 I said you're soft.	Hey, man, don't ever call me that.
2 I call it like I see it, and what I see is definitely soft.

1 I wouldn't do that if I was you.	Shut up. It's too damn hot. What do you know, anyway?

1 What's up, Ray?	Claude.
2 Sure is hot today. Think it'll rain later?	What do you want, Claude?
3 What do I want? What makes you think I want something?	My daddy always said when a man starts talking about the weather keep you hand on your wallet.
4 Your daddy must have been a helluva guy, a deep man, a wise man. Sure wish I could have met him --	Cut the bullshit. What do you want, Claude?
5 You still got that map?	Yeah.
6 Well, if you're still thinking about booking it, I want in. I think we can make it.	We? Did I hear you say we? As I recall, you're the one who said there is no we. Guess we got some bad news in that letter, huh?
7 Look, my cousin Maynard is a lawyer. He filed an appeal on my behalf --	On your behalf. What happened to we?
8 The appeal was denied. Then Daisy went and fell for Maynard. They're engaged to be married, can you believe that?	Well, let's just think about that for a moment. He's a successful lawyer up in New York City and you're down here with a bright future in the cotton picking business. Eeny, meeny, miney, Maynard.
9 Come on, man. Don't shut me out. I'm telling you, you and me, that map, we can go places.	You know what, Claude? This whole time we've been down here, you've done nothing but think about yourself, acting like this whole thing is my fault. That plan with your cousin, did that include me?

1 Hundred and Sixty First Street? That's Yankee Stadium.	Hell, yes, Yankee Stadium. Bombers are playing a double-header against the Red Sox.
2 Red Sox... Who's on the mound?	I don't know. Who do you want?
3 Allie Reynolds. He's my boy.	Sure, it says Allie Reynolds right here in the program. He's warming up right now. Man, we're so close to the field I need cleats. How'd you get such good seats?
4 I know people.	They must be the right people. Whoa, there goes the hot dog man. Let's get a couple. Damn, that smells good. Nothing like a ballpark hot dog, huh?
5 You get ketchup?	Ketchup? Who eats ketchup on a hot dog? Mustard's what you want.
6 I can't eat it with mustard.

1 You show them Crawfords how to play ball.	Make 'em throw strikes.

1 Damn, it was getting hot in there.	What the hell are you doing in that trunk?!
2 You didn't think I was gonna let you escape alone, did you?	I ain't escaping! We're picking up the new super just like I told you.
3 Then you're lucky I came along. Doesn't take a visionary to spot a golden opportunity like this. Now help me out of this trunk.	You ain't getting out of that trunk.
4 Come on, man, I'm starting to cramp up here.  We have the chance right here, right now, I say we go!	Go where, Ray?
5 Back to New York for starters.	And what will we do when we get there? I'm sixty-five years old, Ray. So are you. What are we gonna do out here? Get married, have kids, settle down? That boat sailed without us, man.
6 This boat's gonna sail without you, too. I don't care if I last one day out here. At least it's one day of freedom. Now gimme those keys.	Forget about that. You run if you want to, but you're not taking this car.
7 Claude, man, I'm serious. Give me those keys.	I ain't spending a month in the hole so you can take a joy ride.
8 Don't make me take them away from you.	Hey, there's Wilkins!

1 I can't eat this.	Why the hell not?
2 I saw that hot dog guy in the bathroom urinating. He didn't wash his hands.

1 Alright, well, let's say you make it to Greenville. What's there, anyway?	Grandma Dodi's Pork Rib Joint.

1 Alright, listen up! I want every man lined up out here in the yard on the double! Let's move it!	You heard what the man said! Move it!

1 Man, you really bummed me out. That's a terrible story.  Nigger, you crying?	Hell, no! I just got something in my eye.

1 I can't believe this. I always said I'd never end up like this. I thought I'd make something of myself, do something with my life. You know, be successful. Have a big house, a family. Now I'm gonna end up just like daddy.	Don't say that, Rayford. Don't ever say that. He gave up hope. That's where you gotta be different.
2 They gave me life, mama.	I gave you life. And they can't take it away from you. Remember that. You'll get outta here someday. I believe that. You gotta believe it, too.

1 Mr. Johnson is very well connected. If you were to let us go, I guarantee he would show you his appreciation, if you know what I mean.	Are you offering me a bribe?
2 I'm just trying to pay the toll on the road to justice.	You may be able to buy your way out of trouble up in New York City, but down here we take murder seriously.

1 Couple years back, Cookie made it clear to Greenville.	Greenville, that the nearest town?

1 You don't have to drown that fella, Spanky. You already scared him half to death. He didn't know who he was fucking with.	But you do. What does that say about you, Ray? What does that say about me? I've given you a lot of leeway over the years on account of your father. But he didn't last long enough to teach you the meaning of the word respect so I guess I'm gonna have to school you myself.
2 Come on, Spank, I'm just trying to get by here. You remember how it was when you were starting out.

1 Welcome to the party. It's so nice to see all of you here.	Hey, that's Dad's throne! How did Adrian get that? Is Dad okay?

1 Thank you, Nicky. Cause now I'm gonna bust Adrian's head wide open.	I was going to let you out, eventually, Cassius. I swear.

1 I'll call her later.	You know, we saw you save your girlfriend's life.

1 Valerie's crying!	She's so nice.

1 Oh my God, he just opened his mouth and swallowed that spit.	That turn you on there, RuPaul?

1 Your brothers are upsetting the balance of good and evil.	What can I do about it?
2 You can't do jack shit... unless you learn your evil powers.	Nobody's as evil as my brothers. Those dudes put the wick in wicked.
3 Go get a soda out of the fridge.	But those are my roommate's sodas...
4 "But those are my roommate's sodas..." Does that sound like a statement the son of the devil would make?

1 I got no ears! I can't hear!	Now he's got no ears! You happy, Nicky? Your father's got no ears!

1 To do that Cassius and Adrian have to come back through the other way.	So go get 'em, Dad!
2 I'm too weak. The process has already begun.

1 Bus?	Beast.

1 Easy, Liberace.	Oh, would you grow up.

1 Looking for the chief.	We know where to find Nicky.

1 Good idea... kill me.	Dude. Seriously?
2 Yes. I'll meet you at Grand Central at noon. Okay. Do me. I command you.

1 Valerie, it feels like there's a bunch of butterflies flapping around in my stomach. Is that normal?	Sometimes, sure.
2 Good. I was concerned.

1 We're going to Jersey?	East Rutherford.

1 A little strange. I can't stop thinking about this girl, Valerie.	Why? Did she hurt you? Do you miss her? Need a shoulder to cry on?

1 How do you think we got here??!!	You walked in. I saw you. Don't you remember?

1 Do you have anything special in mind?	I don't care... Just get it over with.
2 Hurry... hurry... hurry.

1 The damned Yellows are getting out of hand. Those three ought to be in Cathedral. No business scrambling in Arcade...	What an old, old man you're getting to be, Francis. Weren't you ever a Yellow? I bet you were even wilder than --  come on, Sandman.

1 That's right. The other one came after. The older one. Smashing, killing, burning!	...and he was hunting the first one, this one. Wasn't he? Wasn't he? This one was running, the other one was hunting him...
2 Yes. Oh yes.  He was after you. I remember. You're running!

1 Why show me?	I'm going to run.
2 Why tell me?	You know something.
3 About running, dying what?	Both... running's what I'm interested in.
4 I know what everyone knows. Try like hell for Renewal. You have the same chance everyone else has.	It's different now. Help me.
5 How can I?

1 Are you taking me to them?	Yes.  I don't know what else to do -- with him following us.  Why do you keep running from your --
2 Because he's my friend --  and I don't want to be killed by him -- or anyone.	He's good, isn't he?
3 Will he find us and kill us? Yes... or one of the others.  You know there's only one place to go now...	They won't believe us.
4 I'd rather take my chances with them... than with Francis.	They won't listen.
5 You think Sandmen will?  There's no other way for me,	We'll convince them.

1 It's getting dark and cold. I'm tired.	Why don't we rest here? We know we can eat these.

1 That sweet madman -- how could he come to exist?	He had a mother and father -- and he knew them.
2 One in a million, I suppose

1 What belongs to the people?	All this. All of it.
2 What people?	I don't know... but it does.

1 But there may be a few around somewhere.	What makes you think so?
2 My parents thought so. Mother and Father. You know?	Mother and -- ? You knew your mother and father?

1 That's better than gold when it's cold.	Thank you.  Tell me -- what do those words mean? "Beloved husband"... "Beloved son"... "Beloved wife"...
2 My father was the husband and my mother was the wife. "Beloved" is a word they used -- to stay together.	Stay? They lived together all their years?
3 Oh, yes... I think...

1 You want somethin'?	No, I'm okay.

1 Very strange.	What is?
2 The angle. The high angle shot on the tape.

1 You recognize that guy?	Yeah... Laurent.

1 Have you partied with him?	I used to.

1 Where's the bathroom?	Up the stairs - down the hall.

1 Sheila?	Yes, there was a man with you... She brought you here... She didn't know what else to do.
2 What is this? Why didn't you tell me? What?... I don't remember any of this.

1 How about Madison? Have we had even a hint of his whereabouts?	Nothing, Marsh. Vanished. There's an APB out on him. His photo's been faxed nationwide.

1 What's the matter?	Nothin'.

1 There's no other bedroom?	No... There is, I mean, I use it as a practice room... it's soundproofed.

1 What's that?	A videotape.
2 Who's it from?	I don't know... There's no return address on the envelope... In fact, there's no address on it.
3 Does it say anything on the tape?	No, nothing.

1 What the hell is going on?!	I wish I knew.

1 Andy would go for this, don't you think?... Firing squad, definitely.	Do they aim for the head or for the heart?
2 The heart, I guess.	I wouldn't... The brain would know what's going on. Your heart would be ripped open trying to pump blood, blood pouring into the chest cavity. Savage pain, Marian.

1 Her name is Alice. You know I love that girl to death. If I ever found out somebody was makin' out with her, I'd take this...  ...and shove it so far up his ass it would come out his mouth... Then you know what?...	What?
2 I'd pull the trigger and shoot him right between the eyes.

1 You still care about me?	Sure. Sure I do.

1 All of it?	Yes. Might as well - all of it.
2 Yes, sir.	I'll dispatch a convoy to meet him.

1 Yes, it just shows  I don't know why I'm talking to you. I don't know you. Who are you?	Okay, brother.
2 Don't call me brother.	Okay, sister.  No offense. No offense!

1 Yeah? If this be execution, lead me to it.	That's what they do with cattle just before the slaughter. Fatten them.
2 Uh-huh. You're a scream, Lovey.	Please don't call me Lovey.

1 Hey Lovey, come here! Lovey, I asked for a glass of wine and look what I got. Come on, sit down.	So that's where you are. I might of known it. No wonder you couldn't hear me.
2 You were asked to have a glass of wine. Sit down!	And be poisoned out here in the open?
3 Certainly not!

1 Yes. Unbosom yourself, Mr. Hyde.[11]	All right, I will! I'll let my hair down! Why not? It can't make any real difference now.  Hey Lovey, were you ever chased by the police?

1 There you are! Barnard, you'd better get your things together. We're leaving.	Leaving?
2 Yes. I've just been talking with the porters. They're going to take us. We've got clothing, food, everything. Come on!	When are you going to start?
3 Right this very minute!  The porters are waiting for us on the plateau. And that Chinaman thought he could stop me. Come along.	I think I'll stick around. I'll leave with the porters on their next trip.
4 You mean you don't want to go?	Well - I'm
5 I see. You're afraid of going to jail, eh?	Well, no. You see, I got this plumbing business
6 All right! If you insist on being an idiot, I'm not going to waste time coaxing you.  How about you?	Oh, no - you don't want to go yet, honey.  She'll stick around too.  Is that right?

1 That would suit me perfectly. I'm always broke. How did you pay for them?	Our Valley is very rich in a metal called gold, which fortunately for us is valued very highly in the outside world. So we merely . . .
2 buy and sell?	Buy and - sell? No, no, pardon me, exchange .
3 I see. Gold for ideas. You know Mr. Chang, there's something so simple and naive about all of this that I suspect there has been a shrewd, guiding intelligence somewhere. Whose idea was it? How did it all start?	That, my dear Conway, is the story of a remarkable man.
4 Who?	A Belgian priest by the name of Father Perrault, the first European to find this place, and a very great man indeed. He is responsible for everything you see here. He built Shangri-La, taught our natives, and began our collection of art. In fact, Shangri-La is Father Perrault.
5 When was all this?	Oh, let me see - way back in 1713, I think it was, that Father Perrault stumbled into the Valley, half frozen to death. It was typical of the man that, one leg being frozen, and of course there being no doctors here, he amputated the leg himself.
6 He amputated his own leg?	Yes. Oddly enough, later, when he had learned to understand their language, the natives told him he could have saved his leg. It would have healed without amputation.
7 Well, they didn't actually mean that.	Yes, yes. They were very sincere about it too. You see, a perfect body in perfect health is the rule here. They've never known anything different. So what was true for them they thought would naturally be true for anyone else living here.
8 Well, is it?	Rather astonishingly so, yes. And particularly so in the case of Father Perrault himself. Do you know when he and the natives were finished building Shangri-La, he was 108 years old and still very active, in spite of only having one leg?
9 108 and still active?	You're startled?
10 Oh, no. Just a little bowled over, that's all.	Forgive me. I should have told you it is quite common here to live to a very ripe old age. Climate, diet, mountain water, you might say. But we like to believe it is the absence of struggle in the way we live. In your countries, on the other hand, how often do you hear the expression, "He worried himself to death?" or, "This thing or that killed him?"
11 Very often.	And very true. Your lives are therefore, as a rule, shorter, not so much by natural death as by indirect suicide.
12 That's all very fine if it works out. A little amazing, of course.	Why, Mr. Conway, you surprise me!
13 I surprise you? Now that's news.	I mean, your amazement. I could have understood it in any of your companions, but you - who have dreamed and written so much about better worlds. Or is it that you fail to recognize one of your own dreams when you see it?
14 Mr. Chang, if you don't mind, I think I'll go on being amazed - in moderation, of course.	Then everything is quite all right, isn't it?

1 Amazing, Mr. Chang. This place is amazing! And that marble quarry in the valley is simply magnificent. Oh, I've looked around. I've seen everything. Your woodworkers and your cloth-weavers - they all seem so very, very happy.	Yes.
2 You may not know it, Mr. Chang, but right here you have Utopia.[15]	You've very kind Mr. Lovett.
3 I don't mean it in that sense. I only give credit where credit is due.  Er, Mr. Chang, I'm very anxious to have you realize that I never for a moment believed that ridiculous kidnapping story.	Oh, I'm so glad.
4 Simply preposterous. Do you know what I did last night? Last night, Mr. Chang, I held a sort of a self- inventory. I said to myself last night, Mr. Chang, I said, "Lovey"  Mr. Lovett! "Mr. Lovett," I said, "you are an ungrateful fool . . . "	Why, no.
5 "Ungrateful fool . . . !"  Those were my very words to myself last night. "Here are these people in Shangri-La doing everything in their power to make our stay comfortable and happy and I haven't done one single thing to show my appreciation."	Now, what would you like to do?
6 Well, Mr. Chang, I thought, with your permission of course, and while I'm waiting for these porters, I would like to organize classes for those children in the valley and teach them something practical and something useful. Geology.	Splendid!
7 Isn't it? Isn't it! You know I was a professor for twenty years? - and a very good one.	I'm sure you were. When would you like to start?
8 Oh, immediately.	Then it's done.
9 Oh, thank you. Thank you!	Thank you.

1 Sit here, near me. I am an old man and can do no one any harm.	Are you the High Lama?
2 Yes.

1 Bob, these are all that are left.	Come on! Quick! This way.

1 What is it? Has he fainted?	It looks like it.  Smell those fumes?

1 For heaven's sake, Bob, what's the matter with you? You went out there for the purpose of	George. George - do you mind? I'm sorry, but I can't talk about it tonight.

1 She was kidnapped and brought here two years ago just as we were, Bob.	I don't believe it! I can't believe it. She's lying.  You're lying. You're lying! Every word you've been saying is a lie! Come on, say it!

1 Imagine having all that fuel there, waiting for us!  George, something tells me our journey is just beginning.	Where are we going? Huh?

1 What is?	All of it. Father Perrault and his magnificent history. This place, hidden away from the rest of the world, with its glorious concepts, and now you come along and confuse me entirely.
2 I'm sorry. I thought I was to be the light. But why do I confuse you? Am I so strange?	On the contrary, you're not strange. And that in itself is confusing. I have the same idea about Shangri- La. The sense that I've been here before, that I belong here.
3 I'm so glad.	I can't quite explain it, but everything is somehow familiar. The very air that I breathe. The Lamasery, with its feet rooted in the good earth of this fertile valley, while its head explores the eternal. All the beautiful things I see, these cherry blossoms, you - all somehow familiar.  I've been kidnapped and brought here against my will. A crime, a great crime, yet I accept it amiably, with the same warm amiability one tolerates only from a very dear and close friend. Why? Can you tell me why?
4 Perhaps because you've always been a part of Shangri-La without knowing it.	I wonder.
5 I'm sure of it. Just as I'm sure there's a wish for Shangri-La in everyone's heart. I have never seen the outside world. But I understand there are millions and millions of people who are supposed to be mean and greedy. Yet I just know that secretly they are all hoping to find a garden spot where there is peace and security, where there's beauty and comfort, where they wouldn't have to be mean and greedy. Oh, I just wish the whole world might come to this valley.	Then it wouldn't be a garden spot for long.

1 Now that dinner is over, if you'll excuse us, we're very anxious to discuss ways and means of getting back home.	The first thing we want to do is to cable the Foreign Office. All of England is waiting to hear about my brother. There's a cruiser at Shanghai ready to take him back.

1 ...touch that.	What the hell...
2 Kids' game a couple galaxies over.	I guess I lost:
3 You got smeared.

1 Everybody, listen up: we've had a tremendous amount of movement lately. Be aware.  Be safe.  Have a good day.  Oh, uh... Cowan?	Yes, air? -- OOOMPH.

1 I wasn't scared...	Oh yeah?  The hell you weren't. Little pither just out of school...

1 The point is to not call attention to ourselves.	I understand.  Hey, it works for the Hasids, right?  No one recognizes them.

1 Well, Mr. Intuition... When the neighbors report screaming and we hear nothing but silence, what does that lead you to believe?	I guess it's simple, huh?  They're either gone... or dead.
2 Or someone has a nitrogenizer.	A what?

1 Where's it coming?  Where's he landing?	The Pentagon.

1 It's marble.	All of it?

1 Sure.	Me, too.  I feel a long day coming on.

1 What do we do?	What do we do?    Lean into it.
2 What the hell does that mean?	Actually... I don't know.

1 Not bad.  Briliiant, actually.  You come unarmed, and alone.  Cause your army's been growing underground for what? 100 years? 150?	Give or take.  It was right around your civil war, I think, when I was here last.  We were waiting till your planet was warm enough.

1 I just wanted to scare em.  So I go in to buy a starter's pistol-- you know, the kind they use at track meets that shoot blanks-- and this guy, he said if I really wanted to mess with with them, he had just the thing...	This guy.  Where was he?

1 Jupiter, actually. well, one of the moons.	So whattya say, kid?  You in or out?

1 And get this: you know how humans evolved from primates?  Well guess what the dominant life form on planet evolved from?	Don't tell me.  Insects.

1 No.  Follow him.	He'll turn around.
2 He won't.

1 She's not alive, but she didn't die.	Oh, Jesus...

1 From where?  D.C.?	Baltimore.  Eastside.  Solomon P. Eddie M.D.  I was a plastic surgeon.

1 You the only sentry?	I work graveyard, swing and day all by my lonesome.

1 You understand that a week from now people are going to vote on whether or not what we've been doing down here has been some noble-minded enterprise or a chance to change the way this country fights crime.	I understand.  Sir.

1 People want to believe in the system.  That's the beauty of it...	Beauty?  The precogs don't even always agree with each other!

1 Somewhere near the capital?	No maglev system.
2 The mall?	Georgetown.

1 I'm sorry Danny, but I'll have to give you the full tour later on.	Your secretaries were all kind enough to give me a look around the office...

1 You set me up...	I'll write the paranoia off to the whiff you been doping on all night.

1 Just go to the beginning!	Okay.  Fine.  Where the hell is that?

1 I won!	What a big boy.  How old are you?

1 It floated back up.  I had to take him out and --	NO!

1 Just what is it you think I can do for you?	You can tell me how someone... could fake a prevision.
2 And how would I know that?

1 This is all my fault.	No, it isn't, Lamar.  There was nothing anyone could do.

1 Congratulations, sir.	My God...

1 According to the Sentry, Anderton was watching this at Containment right before he was tagged.	I know.  He came to me, told me about the missing data stream.  He was concerned that you might find it.
2 I did find it.  It was inside of Agatha all this time.  So the question is, why would someone want this erased from the data file?	Danny, tell me what you're thinking.
3 I'm thinking someone got away with murder.	How?

1 The information we need is embedded in the grain of wood.  And since each piece is unique, the shape and grain is impossible to duplicate.	I'm sure you've all grasped the legalistic drawback to precrime methodology.

1 I worked homicide before I went federal.  This is what we would've called an "orgy of evidence".  Do you know how many orgies I had as a homicide copy, Gordon?	How many?
2 None.  This was arranged.

1 My name is Danny Witwer.  I'm --	I know who you are.

1 Wally, the other two can still function, right?	You don't understand... they're a hive mind.  It takes all three for their predictive abilities to work.
2 Are you telling me they can't see murders anymore?	Maybe if he'd taken one of the males.  But the female, she's the key.  She's the one they listen to, the one with the most talent.  The one who takes care of the other two.
3 Jesus...

1 Okay. We got a lot happening here. Here comes the good part... Okay...	Somebody's getting comfortable.

1 You're not my daddy.	You gonna bust my horns, or you want spaghetti
2 I want spaghettis.

1 I never promised you anything.	How could you let her see this?
2 Goodbye, Bobby.	Just so you know, I bought you out with Maxie. I suggest you leave while you can.
3 Don't you get it? I don't want to leave. This is who I am.	Tell you the truth, I don't give a shit for me. But that little girl is so special, and you're gonna fuck her up.

1 How bad is it?	It's bad. Before you even showed up, he said you were Maxie's 'token goons', and not to be trusted. He wanted to TCB alone. I was gonna ride shotgun to keep the English dude above board. Now he's spooked. This shit's snowballing.
2 When's it going down?	Was gonna be tomorrow morning. Now, who knows?
3 Shit.

1 Yes, for expenses and such. Now, you'll be contacted on your pager as to where you should go. You each have been given an extra battery, so there is absolutely no excuse as to why a page would not be immediately returned. Am I making myself abundantly clear?	Yeah.

1 Now listen. The gig couldn't be simpler. You carry the money to the Welshman, he checks it, hands you his marker, you're done. The washed money goes directly to Maxie. Long as you hand off the bag, you're tight.	Where's the drop?
2 You three are gonna meet him for dinner. Find out if and where. Now any of you motherfuckers got anything else to say?

1 Yeah... Mmmm, that sounds good... Uhu...	Excuse me, we need to make a call.
2 I'm on the phone.	It's important.
3 So's this.  Hey baby... Oh, nothing. What were you saying?	Listen, man, we really gotta...
4 I be off in a minute.  Say again...?

1 Nice work.	Shhh...  Yeah, yeah... No. No. I'll be there.  You gotta get me to the Magic Castle at four.
2 How'd you unlock my phone?	I tried your ATM PIN. I gotta kill an hour. Let's grab a beer.
3 Seat belt.

1 'Cardiff Giant.' That's us.	You sure?
2 Yeah. He said that's our account with the car service.

1 Yeah.	So we're working?

1 Nothing, man.	You want us strapped, don't you?

1 We rep lines? You know? Fashion?	And you grew up in Manhattan?
2 Kinda. Yeah.	What do you mean 'kinda?'

1 Yes?	Drinks are free, right?
2 Yes.  Would you care for another one?	Yes.

1 And where is...?	Ruiz? Oh, he ain't here.
2 No?	Nah, see, Maxie just asked him to set that shit up as a favor. He, you know, he tied in with the club. Set us up so, you know, you feel at home.
3 Well, I didn't care for the club much. And, I must say, I didn't care for him either.	Well, he ain't gonna be around no more.
4 Pity. What's say we have a drink?

1 Good morning.	You think this shit's funny, Ho?
2 Nah, man...	You think it's funny, motherfucker?

1 dollars in c-notes, a numeric pager, a double-A battery, and a first class round-trip ticket to JFK.	We're going to New York?
2 Yes. You're going to New York.	And the money. Where do we bring the money?
3 That money is your per diem.	And where do we bring it?

1 Who's gonna outfit us?	Outfit? What's he talking about?

1 Sombitch and I ain't never been to Beantown.	Man's rep travels.
2 How 'bout that?

1 It hit?	Nnnnnnn!

1 Take it easy, baby.	That really you, Red?

1 Sure, burn yourself, pain yourself, put all that poison into your hair, into your body -- trying to be white.	Man, I don't want to hear all that.
2 I thought you was smart. But you just another one of them cats strutting down the avenue in your clown suit with all that mess on you. Like a monkey. And the white man sees you and he laughs. He laughs because he knows you ain't white.

1 Sure, white man throw us a bone and that's supposed to make us forget 400 years.	A black man playing big league ball is something.
2 I told you to go behind the words and dig out the truth. They let us sing and dance and smile -- and now they let one black man in the majors. That don't cancel out the greatest crime in history. When that blue- eyed devil locked us in chains -- 100,000,000 of us -- broke up our families, tortured us, cut us off from our language, our religion, our history.

1 What can I do for you?	Mr. X, I was out there tonight. I saw what you did. I want to be a Muslim. I ain't never seen a Negro stand up to the police like that.

1 Women talk too much. To tell a woman not to talk is like telling Jesse James not to carry a gun or a hen not to cackle. And Samson, the strongest man that ever lived, was destroyed by the woman who slept in his arms.	Shall I tell my sisters that we oppose marriage?

1 I never told you, but when I first saw you on the podium, cleaning your glasses, I felt sorry for you. Nobody as young as you should be that serious. But I don't think that anymore.	What do you think?
2 The simplest thing in the world: I want to have a lot of babies with you. Dear Heart, I love you.

1 I want to also, but until we are instructed by the Messenger to do so, we will just wait and pray.	I'm tired of praying.
2 That's enough, Brother Earl.

1 Mr. X is a demagogue. He has no place to go, so he exaggerates. He's a disservice to every good law-abiding Negro in the country. Can I ask you a question?	Please, go ahead.
2 Mr. Malcolm X, why do you teach black supremacy? Why do you teach hate?	For the white man to ask the black man if he hates him is just like the rapist asking the raped, or the wolf asking the sheep, "Do you hate me!" The white man is in no moral position to accuse anyone of hate.

1 Is she hooking?	Not yet. But the way things going, that boy gonna turn her out any day.

1 Thank you, Brother; Sister, how are you?	Please make way, please --

1 You had the number.	Baby, I got to let this old man win. Keep the faith, and tell Billie I'll see her later.

1 Don't never try to cross someone who ain't afraid to die.	You the man!

1 Only a pig could do a thing like that.	Watch your tongue, boy.
2 Don't you call me boy, you pig. Letting a man bleed like that.

1 Creasy...  I'd have liked to have known you under different circumstances.	Off the top of my head, I don't know what they could've been.

1 I traced the PIN. I have an address for you. But I need to see you.	I show, you give me the information?
2 Deal.	Where?

1 [Drive.]	[Do you know who I am?]
2 [You are Jorge Ramirez.]

1 [Yeah.  Yes.]	[Listen! I will give you a life for a life.]
2 [What do you mean?]	[Her life for your life.]

1 Is it loaded?	It's loaded.

1 It's not exactly a scam, Crease. Even at half speed you're pretty damn good.	A bodyguard has to be close to someone all the time. Willing to talk. I'm not good at that.
2 So you'll be the silent type. People will appreciate that.

1 Cut the stock here. The barrel here. Make sure you file it smooth.  Rocket launchers?	Different door. Not far from here.

1 And don't start crying.	I'm not crying.

1 Doesn't matter. I always finish second.	You need to practice.

1 The gunshot holds no fear. Say it.	The gunshot holds no fear.
2 You welcome the sound. The sound is what lets you go. The sound is what frees you. You are a prisoner in those blocks until you hear the sound.

1 Mr. Creasy, I wanted to make sure you have everything you need.	I'm fine.
2 Is the food alright? Maria tells me that you didn't eat.	The food's fine. Sometimes I don't eat.
3 It insults Maria. Slip it to the dog if you have to... Do you mind if I talk to you for a moment?

1 Rosanna Guerrero.	It's Creasy.
2 Where are you?	Los Arcos. Was a little girl kidnapped recently? About twelve maybe?
3 Last night. Do you know something?	What was her name?
4 Camila. Camila Valencias.

1 Could he speak English? Emilio couldn't speak English.	We'll see. And thank your father in the morning. A man always needs to be thanked.

1 I think it's nice he's American.	I think it's fantastic.
2 You realize that you've brought a killer into the house.

1 [Is it true? Creasy saved the little girl that was kidnapped yesterday.]	[And left three more dead men.]

1 Hey, Herbie...	What?
2 You wanna have a drink before we start dancing?	Listen. You people go grab a table. I'll be back inna minute. I'll be right back.

1 Who you gonna call?	I was gonna call that girl from last night. Take her to a movie tonight.
2 Are you kidding?	Listen, Angie, I wanna tell you, you were very impolite last night. I introduced you to the girl, you just turned and walked off. Now, why did you do that?
3 You got me mad, that's why. Hey, Joe, show Marty that picture.

1 Ufa!	I keep one eye open when I sleep, because she's gonna come in, stab me in my bed.
2 Catherine, I want you come live in my house with Marty and me.

1 You gotta real nice face, you know? It's really a nice face.	Thank you.

1 So I was telling you, my kid brother Nickie got married last Sunday. That was a very nice affair. And they had this statue of some woman, and they had whiskey spouting outta her mouth. I never saw anything so grand in my life.  And watta meal. I'm a butcher, so I know a good hunka steak when I see one. That was choice filet, right off the toppa the chuck. A buck eighty a pound. Of course, if you wanna cheaper cut, get rib steak. That gotta lotta waste on it, but it comes to about a buck and a quarter a pound, if it's trimmed. Listen, Clara, make yourself comfortable. You're all tense.	Oh, I'm fine.
2 You want me to take you home, I'll take you home.	Maybe that would be a good idea.

1 You don't think my sister Catherine should live in her daughter-in-law's house?	Well, I don't know the people, of course, but as a rule, I don't think a mother-in-law should live with a young couple.
2 Where do you think a mother-in-law should go?	I don't think a mother should depend so much upon her children for her rewards in life.
3 Well, maybe that's what they teach you in New York University. In real life, it don't work out that way. You wait till you are a mother.	It's silly of me to argue about it. I don't know the people involved.

1 I always figure a guy oughta marry a girl who's twenny years younger than he is so that when he's forty, his wife is a real nice-looking doll.	That means he'd have to marry the girl when she was one year old.
2 I never thoughta that.

1 Oh, we got plenny-a room here.	Sure! Sure! It's gonna be nice! It's gonna be nice! I'll come over tonight to your house, and I talk with Catherine, and you see, everything is gonna work out all right.

1 That was a nice girl last night, Marty.  She wasn't a very good-looking girl, but she looks like a nice girl.  I said, she wasn't a very good-looking girl... not very pretty...	I heard you, Ma.
2 She looks a little old for you. About thirty-five, forty years old?	She's twenty-nine, Ma.

1 I'm with a girl, Ralph.	Get ridda her. This is money inna bank.
2 I can't do that, Ralph, because somebody already brushed her off once tonight.	This is a good deal here, Marty.

1 I just wanna thank you people again, because the situation was just becoming impossible.	Siddown, Thomas, siddown.

1 Well, I'll tell you, Aunt Theresa...	Lemme tell it, Tommy.
2 Okay.	We want you to do a very big favor for us, Aunt Theresa.

1 We wanted to tell you how you were helping us with your fixes.	Well, sure, but I'm also worried about Walt Waldowski  Painless. His poker players got in an argument and asked him for a ruling, and he said what difference did it make, it was just a card game.

1 You boys'll have to go to work early.	You fixing to add overtime to a twelve- hour day? The union ain't gonna like it.

1 It certainly isn't Henry's fault Hot Lips Houlihan doesn't like her name.	Or her figger.

1 Us. Lead us not into...	...No cases over the age of temptation but deliver us eight. from evil. For Thine is the kingdom, the power and...

1 What do you think of that piece of scenery, Yankee boy?	Finest kind. We'll sit where we can get the best view.

1 Best equipped dentist in the whole goddam Army. Care to have a look, a man with your background?	Way we hear it, the Pride is supposed to have run up the highest lifetime batting average ever recorded in Wayne County.

1 Never heard of him.	Sure you have, only as 'Spearchucker' Jones.
2 The nigra boy with the Philadelphia Eagles?

1 Let's hear from you, you goddam Yankee. Be nice to see you some time.	Like the Spearchucker said, that's possible. Anyway, it's been an interesting association.

1 If we had closer relations, there wouldn't be any misunderstandings. That's where a football game would help. Between your outfit and mine.	A football game?
2 Special Services in Tokyo are all for it. They say it's one of the main gimmicks we have to keep the American way of life going here in Asia.	But what about Major Houlihan?
3 You mean Hot Lips? Screw her.	N-n-no thanks, G-General.

1 Radar!	All you have to do is ask.  The quarterback is saying they'll run the old Statue of Liberty. Their left end will come across and take the ball out of his hand and try to get around our left end.

1 We stand behind all our work.	You want it straight? Medical history records no instance of anyone taking this particular prescription and surviving.

1 Please!  Face it, Colonel, you don't have us, we have you. Your boys blew this case, we bailed you out. We figure we ought to hang around a day to check the Congressman's kid, and we also figure to play some golf. So if that's okay with you, we got a deal.	And if it isn't, why don't we call Washington on your telephone? You tell your story, we'll tell ours.
2 When you make up your mind, get in touch. The golf club is probably the best place to leave a message.

1 It's five minutes into nurses' shower hour. Where are they?	They're coming.

1 What's the matter?	We may be in trouble, I can't catch my breath. I've got the occupational disease of oversized ex-athletes.

1 You please excuse...  I have been making examination of this young man to find if he will be soldier in our army.	Yes, I know. Hi, Ho-Jon. How did it go?
2 I don't liking it at all, what I hear when I listen to the heart. And such a blood pressure for so young a boys. Is frightening.	I'm sorry to hear that. You think he's unfit for military service?
3 At first is no doubt. But then I am seeing on his paper he work in American hospital. And I think there are so many drugs in such a places, he could take some by mistake.	Why would he do that?
4 Who is knowing? But the drug I have find in his urine is solving all mysteries. By tomorrow will be gone his fast heart and high blood pressure. So I think maybe you will like to tell him goodbye. Okay?

1 He's coming to.	Let's get his clothes off quick.

1 Good morning, Captain Pierce and Captain Forrest.	You can cut the bow.
2 I have not understood what you means.	That. It's out of the act.

1 You work those kind of hours, you got to have rest. Which you can't get with somebody jabbering away on a direct line to heaven.	Major Burns will be out of your tent in twenty-four hours.  Tell them Captain Pierce and Captain Forrest are on their way.

1 We got it, men... Ho-Jon's keep as Androscoggin... if there is such a place. And the big news is, the General wants a rematch.	I'll tell you my news. I'm retiring from football.

1 Well, there's one big satisfaction.	What's that, Henry?
2 I out-coached that General Hammond.

1 How is he?	Nice.
2 Arterial silk.

1 Yeah. No, no!  No! No, look. You don't have to smell the world! 	Well, all those guys in the bleachers think
2 Never mind those guys. All right, stand up. Now let's see what you look like when you protest.	Against what?
3 Against anything. Just protest.	You got me.
4 Oh, look. I'm the umpire, and you just cut the heart of the plate with your fast one and I call it a ball. What would you do?	Oh, yuh did, huh?
5 Yes!	Why can't you call right, you bone- headed, pig-eared, lop-eared, pot- bellied
6 Grab it, Eddie, grab it!

1 Ted Sheldon.	Yeah, that's the one.

1 Oh! Oh, it's beautiful, D. B. WellI don't quite know what to say . . .	Well, don't say anything at all. Just sit down.

1 Yeh, D. B. Oh, just cleaning out the dead-wood. Okay.	Look, Mr. Connell . . . I just can't afford to be without work right now, not even for a day. I've got a mother and two kid sisters to . . .

1 That's fine! That's fine!  Now fall right into their laps. Go ahead. Say John Doe walked in and called the whole thing off. You know what that's going to sound like on top of this!	That's all, Ned. Thank you.

1 Okay, fellows.	Take it easy, John Doe.

1 No sense in going up there! I been here for hours. He ain't here!	Oh, let me go, will you!
2 Now, that's crazy. It's fourteen floors!

1 Hey, Boss.	Oh, quiet, quiet, quiet.  Say, tell me something did you read that speech you're gonna make tonight?

1 St-rike!	I know why you're hangin' aroundyou're stuck on a girlthat's all a guy needs is to get hooked up with a woman.

1 It makes no difference, Bertthe ideas's still good. We don't have to give up our club.	Yeah? Well, you can have it!

1 I trust him.	Oh, you trust him, eh? Well, that's fine. I suppose he trusts you, too?

1 Go down to the office and arrange for some radio time.	Why, D. B., you're not going to fall for
2 I want it as soon as possible.	Okay. I just came in to get warm, myself. Come on, let's go.

1 What's your name?	Willoughby. John Willoughby, Long John Willoughby they called me in baseball.

1 I bet you he'd know how to say it all right. And me, I get up to it and around it and in back of it, but, but I never get right to it. Do you know what I mean? So the only chance I've got is, well, if somebody could kinda give her a warning sort of, sorta prepare her for the shock!	You mean you'd like me to do it, huh?
2 Well, I was thinking thatYeah, you know, sort of break the ice.

1 They're not usually graduate students.	SWAT wants to go in.
2 What's the rush? They haven't killed anybody yet this week?

1 Duke Ellington. "Things Ain't What They Used To Be", recorded July 30, 1945.	Yeah... Yeah... Now I can hear it.

1 Who's controlling your mind?	Whoa!... The government. They control everybody's mind. You're too fucking stupid to know that?

1 What?!	You want a convertible or hardtop?

1 You don't have to come here.	Yes, I do. That way there's no misunderstandings. I need to make sure no one's hurt, then we can take care of business.

1 Same here. I've watched you in action. Very impressive.	You've got a lot of hard work ahead of you if you want to be a negotiator.
2 I'm ready to do it.  And I'm going to be here more than two weeks.

1 Come on. Let's go for a drink.	I don't really like to drink.
2 You have to. It's a tradition.	Well, if I have to, I have to.

1 Nah, I just throw that in because I enjoy it.	So what do I say to this guy?
2 You could say something like,  "Tell me what the scumbag's name is. Maybe we can work something out."	What? Bring somebody in so he can cut his nuts off?

1 We need the 4 and 6 to finish to first and second.	Fine.

1 There's your answer. He's smart.	He's cutting down the visibility.
2 And doing a very good job of it.

1 I know how you feel, Ray.	You don't know shit, and I suggest you leave.

1 Yeah. I'm sorry.	Can I come in?

1 How's Paco doing?	He was going nuts at the park. He met this very attractive poodle. They made plans to meet again next weekend.

1 I've never seen sea so blue. Tahiti is magnificent, Scottie.	Yeah, I could get used to this Paradise shit.

1 Roper.	What?
2 Are you going to make this hard for me?	Depends. What's up?
3 There's been some concern about you continuing to work without back-up.	Define concern.

1 God-Damn you!	Yes, I believe he has --
2 -- You've made your point!  You've got control of the system.

1 You were right.	About what?

1 But what would happen to me?  I have no body to return to.	Not my problem.
2 So wrong --

1 Where the hell are you going?	Unfinished business.
2 And what about the reconfiguration?	Perfect opportunity for you to demonstrate your continued worth.

1 Get some internal police there. Tell them to run a perimeter.	But have them wait for me 'till they move in on him.

1 The only way to eject it is from the inside.	You've got the keys, send someone in --
2 -- Christoph changed the maze.

1 An interface attendant.	Where?
2 Times Square.

1 That's why they told you you can't go inside.  They can't have you running into her.	Her?

1 What's so funny?	This.  No point to it.
2 Why not?	Because you'll never believe me.
3 Try me.

1 We've got him locked!	Speed?

1 He wants to know if you'd like a cube of sugar in your tea.	Ah... sure.

1 Anybody see anything?	... Let's take a look over there.

1 Ay, yi, yi!  The Rangers are going to be CRUSHED!	Don't lose hope yet, Alpha!

1 That's the only way to the Monolith...	We can take these guys!

1 FOUR SECONDS TO IMPACT!	WE'RE OUTTA HERE!

1 It's... an eagle?	Look closer.
2 ... A falcon?	Tommy, you are the Falcon, Winged Lord of the Sky.

1 But boss, what about their parents?	Ah, the old and doddering.  I'm going to SCOURGE their puny minds, reducing them to ZOMBIE'S. And then I'll put them to work rebuilding my empire.

1 Rrgh mmffpprr brghuh!!	How dare you?!  Nobody shuts up Rita but me!

1 There seems to be some confusion about your registration. I believe I can find you a place at the Ambassador. Many persons of the Jewish faith find it quite...	I ain't no fuckin' kike!
2 I'm sorry, sir. Our clientele is restricted to White Anglo-Saxons.	And I ain't no nigger either!
3 Sir, we do not use such names at our hotel.

1 Up here, Boss.	That ain't exactly been the lucky spot lately.
2 But from now on it's Lucky's spot.

1 When the stiff's an Irish, the cops take it kinda personal.	Can't we get a couple whores over?

1 How much longer we gotta be shut up in this fuckin' sweatbox?	Long as Charlie says.

1 You here with Bobby?	No. I'm here with you.

1 Charlie?	I'm doin' business here!
2 But there's...

1 Meyer.	It's nothin'. I'm gettin' married.
2 Married? To Anna?  You ain't got her in trouble?	No. We ain't even...
3 Well, good. Woman like that you don't have to keep an eye on.	Guess I'm not a single type guy.
4 Whatta ya mean? It's great!

1 Come off it, Bugs.	Come off it, Bugs.
2 Ben-jamin.

1 Tommy tells me that Capone's coming in from Chicago.	He's trying to make it.
2 He'll think something's wrong I ain't there.	He'll know you were smart enough to stay away, Boss.
3 What the fuck does that mean?	You know that if you come, we gotta invite Maranzano.
4 So fuck him. I don't care anymore. Let him come.	So he can talk to all the families behind your back? Maybe have his own meet at 3:00 AM under the goddamn boardwalk? No. You're too smart for a sucker play.

1 Sure. But ya got a deck a cards? I wanna play some Klob.	Come on, Charlie. We got business.
2 Couple hands. No harm in it.

1 Tell me, my son. Why did you go with Giuseppe? He's not our kind.	I found that out.
2 We learn from life.	That's why I'm here.
3 Coming with me will be a delicate matter. We will work it out. But Charlie...

1 Strategy.	Talk English. Okay? I did lousy at school.
2 The Big Picture.	That's just what I'm sick of. Everybody lookin' ta knock somebody off! Greedy for what you got. A bunch of fuckin' hogs at the trough.
3 So change it.

1 Maranzano wants you dead.	Yeah. But he needs me alive.

1 Special occasion?	I don't know. I guess it was...

1 Jeez, it all looks like bad late-night cable.	Sad commentary, huh?

1 Three months. <i></i> There's always some brain damage. But at three months...the chances of coming back shrink dramatically with every day.	I want him to have every chance, Doctor. We can certainly give it...three months.

1 No. I want to give him <u>more</u>. I want to give him a massive dose.	That's not going to stop his nightmare -
2 I don't want to <u>stop</u> the nightmare, Hutch. I want to crank it up. I want to take it right off the charts. I want to <u>scare him awake</u>.

1 Land of Death. How do I get there?	Kid, listen: <u>that's all I'm saying</u>. And you didn't hear it from me.

1 And speaking of which, here's the light of my life, the pert and saucy Miss Julie McElroy.	I had to park two blocks away. Is something -

1 Stu?	Julie?... Hey, you <u>are</u> a looker.

1 Don't ask where I got it.	You can't do this! You'll get in trouble!
2 You're the only true-hearted man I ever met. You find a way back to that girl of yours and make her happy.	How am I gonna get past the guards?
3 <u>I'll</u> worry about the guards. <i></i> OKAY, STU. SEE YOU IN A DAY OR TWO.

1 <u>He</u> got an E-ticket. Where's mine? <u>When do I get</u> <u>to wake up</u>??	Stu? Stu? Let's not disturb the nice Reaper.
2 I've been stuck down here for <u>months</u>. Somebody had better start paying attention, or I'm gonna - I'm gonna <u>kick ass</u>!	Let's not kick the nice Reaper's ass.

1 Stu...Stu...	IT'S NOT WORKING.
2 There's a thing here! There's a switch!

1 I wanted to ask you something.  Those motorcycles across the street ...?	Uh-huh?
2 ... What are they all doing there?	That's the Satan's Disciples' New York headquarters.
3 The motorcycle gang?  Don't they deal drugs and rape young girls?	I've never had any problem with them. People say it's the safest block in the East Village.  I just hope their motorcycles don't keep you up at night.

1 Who is it?	It's Marika.  Is Paula there?
2 She's at work.  I'm her mother.	Oh.  I thought today was Saturday.

1 --what possible explanation can you offer for this charge being--as you say--"trumped up" against you!	It was done to stop me from talking about a section of the Appropriations Bill!
2 It was?	Yes! This was how I could be put out of the Senate and out of the way! They even *promised* me that if I--

1 No, not yet, Senator Paine--not hide nor hair of the man. You mean to say the boys haven't--?	Eight to five Little Boy Blue is plastered.
2 Well, why don't they try the police-- get some blood hounds--or Indian guides--

1 Did you like the first act?	Yeah. What about the second act?
2 That's taking place outside now.

1 I knew it! I knew a night's rest wasn't possible in this house!  Hubert!	Wha--? Yes, sweetheart-- Wha--?
2 That infernal phone!	Yes, yes--phone, phone--  A--an outrage, pet--an outrage--I'll look into this--  Hello--Joe!--What!--No! Not really! Terrible!
3 What is it?

1 Terrific! A born stooge! Horace'll perform like a trained seal.	Jim--if I fling a party man like Horace in the face of those angry committees--

1 Boy Ranger! The answer to a prayer. Manna from heaven! Didn't know the time of day--!	Will you please tell me *exactly* what he's done?
2 Yes! He's about to blow the whole machine to smithereens--and *you with it*, Mr. Governor!	Me! Jim--how--?
3 You couldn't understand! Listen, Ten Thumbs, I'll be on my way to Washington in half an hour. Whatever happens, I'm all ready for this Ranger of yours. Never mind how. You'll get your instructions from Ken Allen here. It isn't anything you have to do. I wouldn't trust you to lick a stamp. Allen'll do it himself. You just use your *high office* to help him get it done. Understand?	Y-yes, Jim.
4 I doubt it! Come on, Ken.

1 No, *sir*! You couldn't do better, Dad.	Than what?
2 Jeff for Senator.	Emma! Will you *please*--?

1 Washington!	Yeah, for the fifth time, Senator-- Washington.
2 My pigeons--I better see about my pigeons.	The porter's got them. They're coming.
3 Just a minute, I better make sure.	Boy! My head's like a balloon--for two whole days. I never knew there was so much American history.

1 Well, it isn't much, but if you insist, here's this week's. 	"Boy Stuff." Why, printer's ink runs in your veins, Jeff. You're just like your father.
2 Thank you, sir.	Even to the hat. Same old dreamer, too. One look at you and I can see him, back of his old roll top desk, hat and all, getting out his paper. Always kept his hat on his head so as to be ready to do battle. Clayton Smith, editor and publisher, and champion of lost causes.
3 Yeah, Dad always used to say the only causes worth fighting for were lost causes.	You don't have to tell me Jeff. We were a team, the two of us, a struggling editor and a struggling lawyer. The twin champions of lost causes, they used to call us.
4 Ma's told me about it a thousand times.	His last fight was his best, Jeff. He and his little four-page paper against that mining syndicate and all to defend the right of one small miner who stuck to his claim. You know, they tried everything, bribery, intimidation, then--well--
5 Yes, Ma found him slumped over his desk that morning...	Shot in the back. I was there. I can see him at that old roll top desk, still with his hat on... still with his hat on...
6 I know. I suppose, Mr. Paine, when a fellow bucks up against a big organization like that, one man by himself can't get very far, can he?	No.

1 Yes, sir, I yield for a question.	The gentleman has said repeatedly that he is speaking to the people of his State. He has been waiting, as he so fancifully puts it, for them to come marching here in droves. Would the gentleman be interested in knowing what those people have to say?

1 Can't you?	You mean--you tell these men--and Senator Paine what to do?
2 Yes! I've told Senator Paine for twenty years--	You're a liar!

1 Go ahead--punch.	Punch?
2 I had a lot to do with that little press conference last night--	Well, then, I--I *thank* you, Miss Saunders! Nothing better could have happened--. Yes *sir*, Miss Saunders, we're going right ahead with it!
3 We're going right ahead with--*what*?	Why, the Bill--the Bill--to make a National Boys' Camp...
4 One moment, Senator. Do I understand you're going to present a *Bill*?	Sure! A Bill. Senator Paine and I decided it was the one way in the world I could make myself--
5 Pardon me. Senator Paine decided this *with* you?	Yes. Sure. It was his idea. *I* should have been the one to think of it--
6 My dear Senator, have you the faintest idea of what it takes to get a Bill passed?	I know--but you--you're going to help.
7 If I were *triplets*, I couldn't--. Look, Senator--let me give you a rough idea. A member has a Bill in mind--like you--a camp. Right?	Right.
8 Fine. Now, what does he do? He's got to sit down first and write it up. The where, when, why, how--and everything else. That takes time--	Oh, but this one is so simple.
9 I see. *This* one is so simple--	And with your help--
10 Oh, yes. And *I'm* helping. Simple-- and I'm helping. So we knock this off in record-breaking time of--let's say three or four days--	Oh, just a day--
11 A *day*!	Tonight.
12 Tonight.  Look--uh--I don't want to seem to be complaining, Senator--but in all civilized countries, there's an institution called *dinner*--!	Oh--dinner. Yes. Well, I'm hungry, too. I thought--maybe--we could have something brought in--you know, like big executives who eat off trays. You see, we've got to light into this and get it going--
13 Uh-huh. Well, dinner comes in on trays. We're executives. And we light into this. It is dawn. Your Bill is ready. You go over there and introduce it--	How?
14 You get to your feet in the Senate and present it. Then you take the Bill and put it in a little box-- like a letter box--on the side of the rostrum. Just hold it between thumb and forefinger and drop it in. Clerks read it and refer it to the right committee--	Committee, huh?
15 Committee.	Why?
16 That's how Congress--or any large body--is run. All work has to be done by committee.	Why?
17 Look--committees--small groups of Senators--have to sift a Bill down-- look into it--study it--and report to the whole Senate. You can't take a Bill no one knows anything about and discuss it among ninety-six men. Where would you get?	Yes, I see that.
18 Good. Where are we?	Some committee's got it.
19 Yes. They give it to a *sub*- committee, where they really give it a going over--hold hearings--call in people and ask questions--then report back to the bigger committee--where it's considered some more, changed, amended, or whatever. Days are going by, Senator. Days--weeks. Finally, they think it's quite a Bill. It goes over to the House of Representatives for debate and a vote. *But* it's got to wait its turn on the calendar--	Calendar?
20 That's the order of business. Your Bill has to stand *way* back there in line unless the Steering Committee decides it is important enough to be--	What's that?
21 What?	The Steering Committee.
22 Do you really think we're getting anywhere.	Yes. Sure. What's a Steering Committee?
23 A committee of the majority party leaders. They decide when a Bill is important enough to be moved up toward the head of the list--	*This* is.
24 Pardon me--*this* is. Where are we now?	We're over in the House.
25 Yes. House. More amendments--more changes--and the Bill goes back to the Senate--and *waits its turn on the calendar again*. The Senate doesn't like what the house did to the Bill. They make more changes. The House doesn't like *those* changes. Stymie. So they appoint men from each house to go into a huddle called a conference and battle it out. Besides that, all the lobbyists interested give cocktail parties for and against--government departments get in their two cents' worth--cabinet members--budget bureaus--embassies. Finally, if the Bill is alive after all this vivisection, it comes to a vote. Yes, sir--the big day finally arrives. And--nine times out of ten, they vote it down.  Are you catching on, Senator?	Yes. Shall we start on it right now-- or order dinner first?
26 Pardon?	I said--shall we get started *now* or--
27 Yes--sure. Why not?  You don't mind if I take the time to get a pencil?

1 I know. Don't tell me. It was a wonderful party. Your suit went over big. And she looked beautiful, and she gave her hand when you left her-- and said--"Thank you, Mr. Smith." Oh, but it was the way she *said* it. You like to fell through the floor--Horseradish!	Saunders--!
2 And you're writing Ma all about it. And your pigeons will carry the message of love. And the first thing you know--Susan Paine'll get the best jar of preserves she ever tasted!	Are you drunk?

1 *Gentlemen*! Gentlemen are supposed to believe in something decent. Instead of twisting facts and making a joke of everything--why don't you tell the people the *truth* for a change?	The truth! Well, the man wants the truth! "What *is* truth?" asked so-and-so, and turned away!
2 That's what I said--the *truth*!

1 The Senator understands he is limited to five minutes?	Yes, sir--

1 Yeah! How about it? You're a nature lover. Do you handle any of that sign language?	Well--I can *manage*--

1 Joe! You *told* him to!	Yes--a camp bill that will never get beyond a first reading. So calm down, Chick--and--goodnight.

1 Every word that boy said is the truth! I'm not fit for office! I'm not fit for any place of honor or trust in this land! Expel me--!	He did it.

1 Here, here, Susan--this is Jeff Smith-- our new Senator.	I don't care to meet anybody until I get paid--come on--come on. One dollar each, please, for the Milk Fund.

1 Order!	Finally, there was only one answer to a man like him--the truth--which I rose and gave to this body!  Mr. President--he has told lie upon lie--every lie a desperate attempt to conceal his own guilt. And now, he is trying to blackmail this Senate-- as he tried to blackmail me! To prevent his expulsion, he would probably even try to hold up this Deficiency Bill--vital to the whole country--which must be passed immediately--*today*! *Anything*--to force you to clear his bad name and save his hide!  Gentlemen--I--I have no more patience with this--this *rascally* character. I apologize to this body for his appointment--I regret I had ever known him. I--I'm sick and tired of this contemptible young man and I refuse to listen to him any longer! I hope every member of this body feels as I do!

1 Since he was born.	Yes. Elsie Taggart was the midwife.
2 He was a seven-months baby.

1 He's still pixilated.	He sure is.

1 You fainted.	Oh, did I? I'm sorry . . .

1 Have you seen the papers?	Uh-huh.
2 That's what I like about you. You think about a man's feelings. I'd like to go down to that newspaper and punch the fellow in the nose that's writing that stuff

1 I've often thought about going back.	You have?
2 Oh, yes. I used to have a lot of fun there when I was a little girl. I used to love to go fishing with my father. That's funny. He was a lot like you, my father was. Talked like you, too. Sometimes he'd let me hold the line while he smoked - and we'd just sit there for hours. And after awhile, for no reason, I'd go over and kiss him and sit in his lap. He never said very much but once I remember him saying: "No matter what happens, honey, don't complain."	He sounds like a person worth while knowing.

1 Do you mind if I talk to you, Mary? You don't have to pay any attention to me.	No, I don't mind.
2 All my life, I've wanted somebody to talk to. Back in Mandrake Falls, I always used to talk to a girl.	A girl?
3 Oh, an imaginary one. I used to hike a lot through the woods and I'd always take this girl with me so I could talk to her. I'd show her my pet trees and things. Sounds kind of silly but we had a lot of fun doing it.

1 Just a minute. No, you don't.	We're not going out tonight.

1 He'll probably kick me right down the stairs. I only hope he does.	I'll put you on another job. You need never see him again, eh?
2 That's the rub.	Oh, as bad as that, huh?
3 Telling him is the long shot - I'm going to take it.

1 I know, Budington. We can't afford to have the books investigated right now. You must have said that a thousand times already.	But what if they fall into somebody else's hands, why - uh
2 Well, it hasn't happened yet - has it?	But a half million dollars! My goodness, where are we going to get
3 Will you stop worrying! It was I who got old man Semple to turn everything over to us, wasn't it? And who got the Power of Attorney from him ! All right, and I'll get it again!  I'll take it easy. Those books'll never leave this office.

1 You can't come up here!	Let me go! I wanna see him!
2 He's not home, I tell you!	I wanna see that guy!
3 We'll send for the police!	Let me go!

1 You will please permit Mr. Deeds to finish.	But your honor
2 Mr. Cedar!

1 Yes?	Make three reservations on the first train out to Mandrake Falls, Vermont.
2 Where?	Mandrake Falls.  M-A-N

1 I wouldn't worry if I were you. Of course, a large fortune like this entails a great responsibility - but you'll have a good deal of help. So don't worry. Leave everything to me.	Oh, I wasn't worried about that.
2 No?	I was wondering where they're going to get another tuba player for the band.

1 This afternoon - at four o'clock.	I don't think we've got any suitcases.

1 Just as I suspected, wise guy! I don't mind you making a sap out of yourself - but you made one out of me, too.	Will you tell the gentleman I'm not in?
2 Mary Dawson, huh? Mary Dawson, my eye. That dame took you for a sleigh ride that New York will laugh about for years. She's the slickest, two- timing, double-crossing

1 The wrong kind! There isn't any wrong or right kind. Opera is opera!	I guess it is. But I personally wouldn't care to be head of a business that kept losing money. That wouldn't be common sense. Incidentally, where is the $180,000 coming from?
2 Well, we were rather expecting it to come from you.	Me?!
3 Naturally.	Excuse me, gentlemen, there's nothing natural about that .

1 Sorry to keep you waiting so long. Those opera people are funny. They wanted me to put up $180,000.	What about it, Mr. Deeds?
2 Why, I turned them down, naturally.	No, I mean - about my client.
3 Oh - we'll have to do something about the common wife.

1 Look, he's temperamental.	Yeah, what if I am? What about it?

1 Uh-huh.	I write poetry.
2 Uh-huh.

1 Well, we could borrow a couple from Mrs. Simpson. You know, she went to Niagara Falls last year.	I'm kind of nervous. I've never been away from Mandrake Falls in my life. Kind of like to see Grant's Tomb, though.

1 He talks about women as if they were cattle.	Every man to his taste, sir.
2 Tell me, Walter, are all those stories I hear about my uncle true?	Well, sir, he sometimes had as many as twenty in the house at the same time.
3 Twenty! What did he do with them?	That was something I was never able to find out, sir.

1 Why, that's an echo, sir!	You try it.
2 Me, sir?	Yeah.

1 You can go out there if you like...	"There's no shame in getting a little therapy", right, Doc?

1 But they're certainly dead. And yes, personally, I find it a bit odd.	It could happen. What about his state certification exams? The records seem to be in order.

1 Well... you see, when I broke it off with Phyllis, she was naturally upset and she became more determined than ever to pursue certain -- how to put it -- doubts she's been harboring...	What kind of doubts?
2 About you... your background and your qualifications. I'm afraid Phyllis somehow got you mixed up in her fury with me, and actually took the whole issue to the state board.

1 Let me just say something here... I have no idea if this is going to help.	What exactly is it supposed to do?
2 You remember when I asked you about pornography --	-- I find it degrading. Maximum gynecology and minimum turn-on --
3 -- and you told me that. Still, there's some kind of imagery that's haunting you and, I think, getting in your way --	-- Which I don't necessarily agree.
4 But you did come to me.

1 Are you a man who likes to treat himself right?	I've had my moments.
2 I am. And I'm not ashamed of it. Nobody ever said on their death bed -- "I treated myself too well."	I thought it was -- Nobody ever said, "I should have spent more time at the office."
3 Fill in the blank. I don't mind the office. The point is, you only go 'round once. Like the Zens say -- Be here now.	What do you do?
4 Althea hasn't told you?	We've been talking about her, mostly.
5 Well, in '85 four of us left our firms and formed an investment banking venture. We've got twenty-three people working there now.	You've done well.

1 You're early... it's not ready. What happened?	My patient had to leave early.
2 Who was that?

1 ...so rich?	...so accomplished.

1 It's a country club. Don't worry about it.	Thanks for your help, Lionel.

1 Finally, some common sense...	What do you mean?
2 I think you know what I mean.	No, I really don't.
3 I think you do.	Why don't you tell me?
4 Why don't you go to hell? It's all a bunch of nonsense and you know it.

1 We'll take it slow. You'll never feel you can't handle it.	I don't think I can afford it. I don't want my dad paying.
2 We'll work it out.

1 I don't know if I mentioned the headaches.	Did you get headaches before this?  But you get more now? Or more severe?
2 No, not really. They're about the same. My marriage was one long headache.	So the headaches may not even be a part of this?

1 I need to talk to you... Doctor. Can I come in?	Of course.

1 But, there is one... mitigating factor I want you to consider before you write me off.	What?
2 Will you think about it?	I don't know. Depends. I'm in a bad mood.
3 I love you. More than I've ever loved anyone or anything in my life.

1 There's this kid at school... Martin Brockett. He has some gigantic idea of himself that no one else shares. You wouldn't believe the crap he lays on me... Who appointed him my spiritual leader? If he has everything so figured out how come his best friend is a .22 rifle? And why's he spend all his time chasing after me? Probably thinks I'm gonna give him a hummer...	Do you think that's what he wants?
2 No. I don't know what he wants. But I know I don't like being watched. Nobody's ever paid any attention to what I did, and I liked it just fine. Where does he get off telling me I disrespect myself?  Fuck him. Look in a mirror, bozo.

1 This is great!	This is exactly what I wanted.
2 Skip, you must have lots of people you can throw a ball with.	You'd be surprised. Most guys have kids or wives or girlfriends. They're busy. It's not as easy as you think.
3 Skip, you're the head of the whole deal here. Are they busier than you?	Well, you know... that's the thing. Like I said, just about everybody in town works for me. And it's just not the same asking someone to throw a ball when they work for you. It's like an order or something... And no one -- no one -- asks me.

1 All right, I'm just gonna tell you, as simple and direct as I can.  And you understand that this is a big secret? Just between us?  Okay. You know I've got this gift for certain kinds of... machines.	You are Panda, monarch of modems.
2 That's right. And you also know that even though I make 23% of the modems in the world... I cannot make one simple connection with any woman who could truly love me.	Okay... let's say that, for now.
3 It's true, believe me. So... do you know what I've been doing, all alone, in my workshop, for almost two years?... Mr. Find-the-Need-and-Fill- It. How I spend my every solitary hour?

1 Of course, him being insane didn't make it all right that I fell in love with his wife.	Holy shit!

1 Skip, I've got a problem and I need some advice.	You want my advice? Far out!

1 That was a terrible thing.	I don't even know why hang-gliding is considered a legitimate sport.

1 Now go find me a big stick.	In the desert? What for?

1 Goin' somewhere?	Just looking for you, O'Connell! I wanted to be with my friend!

1 ...and how do you say? Those slimy things, in your stomach?	Intestines.
2 Yeah! Them.

1 I'm willin, to go on a little faith, here.	You will not believe it.
2 Try me.

1 And what is he in prison for?	I did not know, so when I heard you were coming, I asked him that myself.
2 And what did he say?	He said... he was just looking for a good time.

1 How do you know the box pertains to Hamunaptra?	Because that's where I found it. I was there.

1 I don't believe in fairy tales and hokum, Mister O'Connell, but I do believe that one of the most famous books in history is buried out there, The Book Of The Living. It's what first interested me in Egypt as a child. It's why I came here, sort of a life's pursuit.	And the fact that they say it's made out of pure gold, makes no nevermind to you, right?

1 There's some sort of lock here. You say these thing's are made of granite with a steel interior?	Quarried granite with a cobalt lining.

1 Are you saying somebody threw these things in with our guy, and they slowly ate him alive?	Very slowly.

1 Don't do it, Evelyn.	I have no choice.

1 But he's just a filthy criminal?	Way to go, Evy.

1 Finish the inscription, idiot!	Oh.

1 Lemme get this straight, they stuck a sharp, red hot poker up your nose, cut your brain into small pieces, then ripped it all out through your nostrils?	OWCH! That's really got to hurt.

1 Believe it, sister. That's what brought our buddy back to life.	And now he's going to use it to bring his girlfriend back

1 What are you doing all alone in the dark?	Fantasizing... about you.

1 We could really use some coffee --	And some sandwiches --

1 No one will believe us.	They'll think we're just a bunch of weirdoes.

1 Doc, these are my friends. We're superheroes, and we need your help.	Well, I give to the United Way, and I feel that sort of covers --

1 And the light goes out...	Frankenstein!

1 Stay away!	Or you'll what? CAN ME?

1 It's me.	Monica, where are you?

1 You drink too much.	When are you going to take off that mask?
2 When I am sure I am among friends.

1 You sure that's how you spell it?	Yeah.

1 He doesn't miss a trick, does he?	What a jerk -- and like nobody knows who he really is!

1 Maybe she's right.	Are you serious? This is the break we've been waiting for!

1 But... only when no one is looking.	Yes.

1 Jeffrey!	Oh hi, Mom.
2 What are you doing in the silver drawer?	Looking for... the TV Guide.

1 Be a Mohican.	Shut up.

1 That was too close.	But we gotta find out what's going on in there.

1 What do you think Napoleon will do?	I, personally, am convinced that he will withdraw his army from Moscow, and attempt to establish himself in Poland for the winter.  In the end, he will not allow himself to be cut off from Paris.  But I believe that if he is offered any encouragement, by Your Majesty, he will postpone this decision as long as possible. He is a gambler and he will trust to his luck.

1 Josephine dead -- how unbelievable! How impossible it is to believe it. She was always physically so strong -- she was never ill a day in her life.	It is a terrible shock.

1 Yes, sir?	A glass of champagne, please.
2 Yes, sir.  I hope you will excuse me for asking, General Bonaparte, but are you Corsican?	Yes, I am.
3 I thought so, I noticed your name when you were announced.  I'm Corsican too -- my name is Arena.	Oh -- where do you come from?
4 Bastia -- and you?	Ajaccio.
5 Have you been back recently?

1 Will Alexander be joining us soon?	I very much doubt that he will.
2 Oh...?	I'm afraid he has been rather upset by the outcome of the battle.
3 I see.

1 Naturally, one does not take much stock in such a piece of filth but, on the other hand, it is not the sort of thing one can simply ignore. What do you think, Joseph?	No...
2 Junot?

1 And you, are you in love with any one else?	No.
2 But you have had mistresses while you were away.	Of course.
3 Were you in love with any of them?	No.
4 Were they pretty?	Yes.
5 Were any of them prettier than I am?	One had better legs.
6 Were any of them married?	Yes.  They were the easiest.  I made love to one of them within ten minutes of our first meeting.
7 She must have been in love with you.	Not in the least.  After all, what is adultery -- only a brief transaction on a couch, requiring a few minutes of privacy.

1 Well, anyway, sorry to call you away from the festivities, but where is the breakdown on serviceable vehicles?  I asked for it yesterday.	I gave it to Berthier... this afternoon.
2 Why did you give it to him?	I thought he would be seeing you before I would, and would give it to you.
3 Well, he didn't give it to me, and when I ask you to do something for me, return the work to me, not to Berthier.	I'm sorry, I thought he would give it to you.
4 I must have the breakdown now. Where is Berthier?	He's downstairs -- somewhere.
5 All right, thank you.  Please ask him to come here.

1 Good evening, ladies.  You must forgive me, my dearest wife, but I simply could not wait to see you.	Oh, then you are...
2 Yes, my dearest Marie-Louise, I am your husband.

1 I suggest that you leave with your men while you can.	Monsieur Varlac, I will count slowly to five, and if you have not begun to get down from the cart by then, I will carry out your execution, on the spot.

1 Led by the warlike Queen Louisa, and her fashion-minded husband, King Frederich Wilhelm, the Prussians still believed themselves cast in the mold of Frederick the Great, and more than a match for Napoleon.  The King had a special collection of 60 splendid uniforms, and was personally involved in the design of all the Prussian army uniforms.	If the French army had been commanded at Jena and Auerstadt by a tailor, the King of Prussia would certainly have gained the day.

1 I know you smoke weed, right?	Why you say that?
2 'Cause your lips is getting black.

1 Where you going?	Ain't the rest room this way?  I gotta pee.

1 Dude, dogs hate me.  I don't know why. Me and K-9's just don't get along.	Well get along with this one.  Go ahead of us.  Don't get seen and don't let that mutt out of your sight.
2 Fuck, what's his name?	Cheeco.

1 I can't see!  I can't see!  Daddy!	Lay down, Day-Day.  Stop moving.

1 $247.	Okay, plan B.

1 Craig, what the hell are you doing?	Nothing.

1 What you see?	That pump was full of money.  I saw where they put it.  Stay right here, I'mma climb in and go get it.
2 Wait here?  So Cheeco can bite my ass off?  Tell me where it is I'll do it.	No, man, just wait.

1 I got my cousin Day-Day waiting for me.	So what?  Let's make'em wait.

1 That nigga worst than them damn pit bulldogs or something!  That's why moving wit'cha Uncle Elroy and Cousin Day-Day is the best thing for you right now.	Ya'll making me look like a punk.
2 It ain't about being a punk, son.  It's about this...

1 You too.	Smokin' what?
2 Nothing.

1 Did you see that?  That was a W.W.F. hit right there, huh, Day-Day?	Yeah, it was.  How you get up here?

1 I gotta think of a plan to get this money before tomorrow.	You could sell your Beamer.

1 What?!  What that mean?	I don't know.

1 Uh...um...I mean uh, can we borrow a cup of sugar?	What?!  This look like a 7-11 or something?  Get the fuck outta here!
2 Alright, no problem.  We gone.

1 You too big.	Keep pushing.

1 Need to lose some weight.	Shut yo' ass up.

1 During a campaign every speech is important. This is free media exposure. Primetime news coverage that we couldn't buy.	What's he doing here?
2 Who, him? Just visiting.

1 I need your help.	What can I do for you Mr....Watson?
2 Its'...ah...about my daughter....

1 I...1 would like to...thank you, Mister Wat... Gene.	I would also like to apologize.
2 For what?	For not believing you.
3 Believe me, I don't blame you.  This is the Governor, Lynn. Say hello.

1 This is for you. In it there is a picture of a woman and an itinerary. It is her itinerary. She is presently - are you listening, Mr. Watson?	Yes, I'm listening.
2 She is presently at the Bonaventure Hotel. That's right near here.

1 I killed you.	You fucked up.

1 Yes, you're right, I don't understand.	Look...my daughter ... she's going to die...unless you can help me.

1 So, come on. You never saw us kiss like that?	No way.
2 How did you see us kiss?

1 I have to do something.	What's that? You have to speak up.  I'm a little deaf in this ear. Between that and my wooden leg I'm a mess. Compliments of the United States Army Artillery Corps.
2 I said I have to do something.	I'll have you out of here in two shakes o'f a lamb's tail.
3 Is within himself.

1 Keep the change.	Don't think I won't.

1 Oh, we'll have to do better than that.	You worthless piece of shit! Gimme that!

1 I'm not a baby.	You're a big girl, huh?
2 I'm not a big girl but I'm not a baby.

1 Look at 'em. He'd do anything for her.-	Young love.

1 He never told about the money.	No.
2 What do you figure he done with it?	He took the secret with him when I dropped him.

1 Ain't seen you in a coon's age, Johnny.	I been mindin' Pearl.
2 Pshaw now! Ain't it a caution what women'll load onto a feller's back when he ain't lookin'?

1 I'll light the lamp.	It's more fun hearin' stories in the dark.

1 Who?	Mr. Powell!  Willa has run away!
2 I'll be switched!...

1 That feller's just achin' to settle down with some nice woman and make a home for himself.	It's awful soon after Ben's passing.
2 If ever I saw a Sign from Heaven!	John don't like him much.
3 Pearl dotes on him.	The boy worries me. It's silly, but it's like there was something still between him and his Dad.
4 What he needs is a dose o' salts!	There's something else.
5 What?	The money, Icey.
6 I declare, you'll let that money haunt you to your grave, Willa Harper!	I would love to be satisfied Harry Powell don't think I've got that money somewhere.
7 You'll come right out and ask that Man of God!  Mr. Paow-well!  Clear that evil mud out of your soul!

1 I tried to save her.	I know you did, Reverend. Oh, I know how you tried!
2 The devil wins sometimes!

1 You'll get awful mad, John. I done a Sin!	You what?

1 Are we goin' home, John?	Ssh...

1 Did you hear what I said, son?	Huh?
2 Married! We have decided to go to Sistersville tomorrow, and when we come back --	You ain't my Dad! You won't never be my Dad!
3 -- and when we come back, we'll all be friends -- and share our fortunes together, John!	You think you can make me tell! But I won't! I won't! I won't!

1 Now: Where?	Under the stone in the floor.

1 About our secrets.	No.
2 Why, pray tell?	Because John said I mustn't.

1 She'll come draggin' her tail back home.	She'll not be back. I reckon I'd be safe in promisin' you that.
2 Maybe she's just run off on a spree.

1 You're Miz Cooper, I take it.	It's about that John and that Pearl?

1 What'd you all talk about?	Pearl and John.
2 John and Pearl!

1 Oh my god, oh my god...	Get the kit!

1 Listen, I got a crazy favor to ask.	Uh-oh...
2 It's nothing too hard or anything.  I'm just going to... LOOK for someone, and... I want you to be sort of a... guard. Okay?

1 Me!? Why would anyone want to kill me?!	Don't ask -- just give me some help nailing this guy when I bring him out.

1 I've got a proposition for you. Listen very carefully, please.	Nan, I --
2 Please. I'm gonna go get the guy who did it and bring him to you. I just need you be right there to arrest him. Okay?	Just tell me who did it and I'll go get him, baby.
3 Fred Krueger did it, Daddy, and only I can get him. It's my nightmare he comes to.

1 Had to've done it. No one else was in there.	How you know that?
2 Cause I thought Glen was gonna sneak out to see your lunatic daughter, that's why. So I locked him in his room!  Sorry. Anyways, the door was still locked when we heard the screams.

1 Take this, it'll help you sleep.	Right.

1 Oh lawyers got fat and the judge got famous, but someone forgot to sign the search warrant in the right place, and Fred Krueger was free, just like that.	So he's alive?

1 And then what happened?	I told you.  It was dark, but I'm sure there was someone else IN there, under the covers with her.

1 What you dream?	I dreamed about this guy in a dirty red and yellow sweater; I dream in color, y'know; he walked into the room I was in, right, right through the wall, like it was smoke or something, and just stared at me. Sort of... obscenely. Then he walked out through the wall on the other side. Like he'd just come to check me out...

1 I'll tell you later.  That Gurganov, you never know whether he's on his way to the washroom or the Secret Police.	You should be more careful, Anna.
2 And you too, Ninotchka.	About what?
3 Ever since you have been back from Paris...	I haven't talked to anyone about Paris. I haven't said a word.
4 That's just it. It makes people feel queer. I dont' want you to get in any trouble.	I have nothing to hide.
5 You should. I'll show you.

1 You must help us, Leon... if you don't win her over we're on our way to Siberia!	Or it might be the firing squad!
2 Or we can't go back to Russia!

1 Just a minute -- just a minute -- I have nothing against the idea but I still say let's go back to the Hotel Terminus. Moscow made our reservations there, we are on an official mission, and we have no right to change the orders of our superior.	Where is your courage, Comrade Buljanoff?

1 You know what they say -- there's nothing like home.	That's right... and we might as well face it.

1 Which lawyer?	You didn't get legal advice?
2 We didn't want to get mixed up with lawyers. They are very expensive here. If you just say hello to a lawyer... well, there goes another cow.

1 All you have to do is say "open sesame."	I don't know how I can get you out of it this time. How will it end? What will happen to you?
2 Shall we tell her?

1 A blue shirt, perhaps?	Blue? Let's offset his mood. Find a striped one, and brighten it with a great blaze of tie.
2 Very well, Your Highness.

1 Is this satisfactory?	Thank you, Louis.

1 Halt negotiations immediately. Envoy extraordinary arrives Thursday six ten with full power. Your authority cancelled herewith. Razinin.	It is Thursday!

1 We don't want to be disturbed.	My name is Count d'Algout. I telephoned.
2 If you want to see us you must come later.	I just want a word with Monsieur Mercier.
3 But you can't...

1 How much does this cost?	Two thousand francs.
2 A week?	A day.
3 Do you know how much a cow costs, Comrade Iranoff?	A cow?
4 Two thousand francs. If I stay here a week I will cost the Russian people seven cows.  Who am I to cost the Russian people seven cows?

1 A Special Envoy is coming from Moscow. He'll occupy the Royal Suite. Move our things to the smallest room you've got.	Yes, monsieur.
2 Right away... instantly!

1 I am ashamed to put the picture of Lenin in a room like this.  Comrades, your telegram was received with great disfavor in Moscow.	We did our best, Comrade.
2 I hope so for your sake.  Let us examine the case. What does the lawyer say?

1 I'm sorry, gentlemen. The other day I heard such a funny story...  It still makes me laugh. It is very funny.  I am sorry. Oh yes... about this injunction...	The hearing is set for the twentieth of this month.
2 That's two weeks from Thursday...	We did our utmost to have it set ahead.
3 I know, gentlemen, but it is in the hands of the Court. We're helpless, aren't we?	Yes. It is unfortunate.
4 Well, there's nothing we can do about it. Why get excited?

1 Four massive piers of masonry are sunk to a depth of forty-six feet on the side of the Seine, and twenty- nine and one-half feet on the other side. The girders of interlaced iron- work which stay the structure have an inclination of fifty-four degrees...	That's a strange angle.
2 Yes, very strange.

1 Glorious, analytical...	The telephone is ringing.
2 Oh, let it ring.	But one of your friends may be in need of you. You must answer.

1 I don't look too foolish?	Foolish? If this dress were to walk down the boulevard all by itself I would follow it from one end of Paris to the other, and when I caught up with it I would say, "Just a moment, you charming little dress, I want you to meet Ninotchka... you two were meant for each other." Ninotchka feels more comfortable.

1 How do you do?	And General Savitzky.

1 Would that make you any happier?	Much happier.
2 All right.

1 Trying to keep me away from you! It couldn't be done. Naturally I couldn't go on forever punching passport officials in the nose -- but I found a way, didn't I? Darling, I had to see you. I wrote and wrote but all my letters came back.	The one I got they wouldn't let me read.  It began, "Ninotchka, my darling," and ended, "Yours, Leon."
2 I won't tell you what came between... I'll prove it. It will take a long time, Ninotchka... at least a lifetime.

1 Leon! What in heaven's name...!	Huh?
2 Is anything wrong? Are you ill?	No.
3 Don't tell me the bed has lost its best friend.	I just couldn't sleep. I got up and went back... and then got up again. These last few days... whew!
4 Darling, you're taking my business affairs far too seriously. Much as I'd love to rob the Bolsheviks of their filthy money, I won't do it at the expense of your health. Particularly as we know we won't get much.  You look so pale... pale but interesting.

1 Now, please, Swana.	Count d'Algout was for several years my personal representative and if it is necessary to sign any affidavit for him I'll be delighted.
2 That does it, Swana.  Now you mustn't miss your appointment with your hair-dresser.	Just in case they don't give you your visa to Russia I want you to know that I have signed a contract for my memoirs and rented a lovely little chteau in the Touraine, and if you feel the need of a change...
3 Thank you, Swana. You are very gracious.

1 Where are they?	You were very careless with our precious jewels, my dear. They're too expensive a toy for two children to play with.
2 Where are they?	Don't worry. Fortunately last night a very trustworthy friend kept his eyes open. Perhaps he overstepped his function as a waiter but he fulfilled his duty as a Russian.  I just put this on for sentiment. The rest are absolutely safe. I assure you. But if you feel like notifying the police...
3 You leave me no choice.	Won't it be rather embarrassing for a Soviet Envoy to disclose the circumstances under which she lost them?
4 I will have to face the consequences, but so will you. Don't forget they will ask how you got them.	That's very simple to answer. They were given to me by my mother. They were given to her by her mother, in fact they're mine, you cannot steal what belongs to you!

1 Where to, madame?	Can you recommend a restaurant?
2 Well, there's Pruniers if you care for seafood. If you want to lunch in the Bois, there's...	Where do you eat?
3 At Pre Mathieu's.	Where is that?
4 It's just a place for workmen.	Where is it?
5 Eight blocks down in the Rue de Poivrel.

1 The bigger problem I see is this guy who was arrested, McCord -- James McCord -- he headed up security for the Committee to Re-Elect.  He turns out to be ex-CIA.	"Ex-CIA"?  There's no such thing as "ex-CIA," John -- they're all Ivy League Establishment.  Is he one of these guys with a beef against us?

1 I was sorry to hear about your wife.	Yes ... I got the money.
2 The President would like to know if that was the last payment.	I'll bet he would.
3 Is it?	In Richard Nixon's long history of underhanded dealings, he has never gotten better value for his money.  If I were to open my mouth, all the dominoes would fall.

1 McCord? ...	Find out what the hell he was doing at "CREEP."  This could be trouble. These CIA guys don't miss a trick. This could be a set-up.

1 The soldiers were provoked.  The students started it, for Christ's sake!	Sir, there's dead American kids here. Let's say we don't apologize for Kent State, but maybe we could have a national prayer day ...

1 This is June twentieth?	It's marked.  Also there's June twenty third.  And this year -- March twenty first.  Those are the ones ...

1 Richardson won't do that.  He'll resign.	The hell he will!  Fire him, too.  If you have to go all the way down to the janitor at the Justice Department, fire the sonofabitch!  And ...

1 We feel the bigger concern is Gordon Liddy ...	That fruitcake!  What about him?
2 Well, you know, sir, he's a nut.  He used to work here with the "Plumbers" and now he's running this Watergate caper.  You remember his plan to firebomb the Brookings using Cubans as firemen?  He wanted to buy a damned fire truck!  Magruder thinks he's just nutty enough to go off the reservation.	What's Liddy got?
3 Apparently he was using some campaign cash that was laundered for us through Mexico.  The FBI's onto it.  We could have a problem with that.

1 I suppose you thought the Presidency was above this sort of thing.	Sir?
2 This isn't a "moral" issue, Bob.  We have to keep our enemies at bay or our whole program is gonna go down the tubes.  The FBI is filled with people who are pissed that I put Gray in and not one of their own.  Vietnam, China, the Soviet Union: when you look at the big picture, Bob, you'll see we're doing a hell of a lotta good in this world.  Let's not screw it up with some shit-ass, third-rate burglary.	I'll talk to Helms.  Oh, Pat asked if you're coming to the Residence for dinner tonight.
3 No, no, not tonight.  Don't let her in here.  I have too much to do.	Yes, sir.  I'll talk to Helms, and, uh ... what's our press position on this Watergate thing?  What do I tell Ziegler to tell them?

1 ... he'd just found out about Track 2.	You never told him?
2 I didn't want him to get the credit. He said I'd stabbed him in the back. Called me a two-bit grocery clerk from Whittier.

1 And his staff.  Come on, the copy they were filing from China was great.	Wait till the Mai-tais wear off.

1 ... I was wondering what's such dynamite in this Bay of Pigs story?  ... although it was clearly effective, because all of a sudden it was no problem for Helms to go to the FBI and try to put a lid on Watergate.	What about the documents he promised?
2 He'll give us the documents.  But I think he should be offered the ambassadorship to Iran.  Then he'll go without a whimper.

1 I can't ...	Thou must.

1 Is there something else that's bothering you, Mr. President?	Yes ... It involves some old and forgotten papers.  Things I signed as Vice President.  I want the originals in my office and I don't want copies anywhere else.

1 ... little Bobby.	Would you walk with me down to the paddock?  I'd like to look at the horses for the eighth.

1 Yeah, well, as I said, Edgar ...	You asked if you could count on my support ... As long as I can count on yours.
2 The old queen did it on purpose.

1 Like you said Jack, I'm just a New York lawyer now.	We'll see about that.

1 Mr. President, we are in a revolutionary situation.  We are under siege -- Black Panthers, Weathermen; The State Department under Rogers is leaking like a sieve.  And now this insignificant little shit Ellsberg publishing all the diplomatic secrets of this country will destroy our ability to conduct foreign policy.	Here, Tim ... Tim.  I'm as frustrated as you, Henry, but don't you think this one's a Democrat problem.  They started the war; it makes them look bad.

1 You'll pick up the middle on this one - the Jews and Negros.	Jews and Negros don't win elections, Henry.  Better to hang them around the Democrats' necks.

1 Do you miss Cuba, Manolo?	Yes, Mr. President.
2 We let you down, didn't we.  Your people.	That was Mr. Kennedy.
3 You don't think he was a hero?

1 It was illegal, what he did.	You know, this kinda thing, you gotta be brutal.  A leak happens, the whole damn place should be fired.  Really. You do it like the Germans in World War II.  If they went through these towns and a sniper hit one of them, they'd line the whole goddamned town up and say: "Until you talk you're all getting shot."  I really think that's what has to be done.  I don't think you can be Mr. Nice-guy anymore ...

1 ... give me a break, Mary.	You all know me.  I'm one of you, I grew up a stone's throw from here on a little lemon ranch in Yorba Linda ...

1 ... but it depends on what I'm doing to the music, Dick ...	Uh, is your mother ... still alive?
2 Yeah, she lives in Dallas ...	She must be very attractive.  Would she like an autograph?  She might remember me ... Where's Trini?

1 Bernstein.	Who the fuck are they?  Bob, are you working on revoking the Posts's television license?  Good.

1 Don't you want to listen to Brown's victory speech?	No.  I'm not going to listen to any more speeches ever again.
2 Amen to that.	It's over, Dick.
3 I'll concede in the morning.	Not that.  Us.

1 Yes ... you know it!  Yes ... I will. Yeah!	Then I'll be there for you.
2 You're the strongest woman I ever met. I love you, Buddy.	Can I just ask for one thing?
3 Anything.	Will you ... would you kiss me?

1 I'm the only left, Dick.  If you don't talk to me, you ...	Brezhnev's coming in three days.  I don't want to deal with them.  And him.  And you.

1 Hey, you know Henry Kissinger -- he's down from Harvard.  On my staff, foreign policy whiz ...	No, but I liked your book on nuclear weapons.  We have similar views on the balance of power ...
2 Well, that's wonderful.  So get me this "crisis" thing, Dick; I'll be glad to take a look at it.

1 No money in his room there?	Couple hundred on his person. Those hombres would've taken the stash.
2 I suppose. Though they was leavin' in a hurry.	It's all the goddamned money, Ed Tom. The money and the drugs.  It's just goddamned beyond everything. What is it mean? What is it leading to?
3 Yes.	If you'd a told me twenty years ago I'd see children walkin' the streets of our Texas towns with green hair and bones in their noses I just flat out wouldn't of believed you.
4 Signs and wonders. But I think once you stop hearin' sir and madam the rest is soon to follow.	It's the tide. It's the dismal tide. It is not the one thing.
5 Not the one thing. I used to think I could at least some way put things right. I don't feel that way no more.

1 Does that look to you like about a '77 Ford, Wendell?	It could be.
2 I'd say it is. Not a doubt in my mind.	The old boy shot by the highway?
3 Yessir, his vehicle. Man killed Lamar's deputy, took his car, killed someone on the highway, swapped for his car, and now here it is and he's swapped again for god knows what.	That's very linear Sheriff.

1 ...I believe they've done lit a shuck.	Believe you're right.
2 That from the lock?

1 ...Could I get you to call Loretta and tell her I've gone to Odessa? goin' to visit with Carla Jean Moss.	Yes Sheriff.
2 I'll call Loretta when I get there. I'd call now but she'll want me to come home and I just might.	You want me to wait til you've quit the building?
3 Yes I do. You don't want to lie without what it's absolutely necessary.

1 ...You got no cause to hurt me.	No. But I gave my word.
2 You gave your word?	To your husband.
3 That don't make sense. You gave your word to my husband to kill me?	Your husband had the opportunity to remove you from harm's way. Instead, he used you to try to save himself.
4 Not like that. Not like you say.	I don't say anything. Except it was foreseen.

1 What'm I supposed to tell Mama?	Try standin' in the door and hollerin: Mama I'm home.
2 Llewelyn --	C'mon, pack your things. Anything you leave you ain't gonna see again.

1 Where does he work?	Did you not hear me? We can't give out no information.

1 Who is this.	You know who it is.

1 Is somethin' wrong?	With what?
2 With anything?	Is that what you're asking me? Is there something wrong with anything?

1 ...Don't put it in your pocket.	Sir?
2 Don't put it in your pocket. It's your lucky quarter.	...Where you want me to put it?
3 Anywhere not in your pocket. Or it'll get mixed in with the others and become just a coin. Which it is.

1 Yessir.	If your expenses run higher I hope you'll trust us for it.
2 Okay.	How well do you know Chigurh.
3 Well enough.	That's not an answer.
4 What do you want to know?	I'd just like to know your opinion of him. In general. Just how dangerous is he?

1 ...Don't worry. I'm not the man that's after you.	I know, I've seen him. Sort of.

1 Sorry you had to see that. You were saying?	I was saying that it seems probable that she witnessed the murder, but her memory of it is gone, at least for the time being. I also think you ought to have her stay with someone tonight.  Any idea who Chloe or Lonnie are?
2 No... Friends from the diner maybe?	Well, you should find out. She keeps talking about them...

1 I questioned Joyce about all this...	Yeah?
2 Seems she was pretty familiar with 'ol Del. On a regular basis, if you get my drift...	...and half the other guys in this town. Including you, I believe...
3 Junior year!	Anyway, so what?
4 So? ...Suppose Betty found out about them?	You said a woman couldn't have done it.
5 A woman can write a check.	So you're saying Betty Sizemore -- our Betty Sizemore -- who you were in swing choir with -- has now hired somebody to scalp her husband in her own kitchen while she watched? You're amazing.
6 'S just a theory... just 'cause I'm thinking it don't mean I like it.

1 Elden, let me out of here. Now! This is ridiculous, I need medical attention!	That's a nice name for what you need...
2 Come on, I have to get this dressing off... it itches! And what about my fish? Who is taking care of them?

1 Do you know who I am?	...I... I know what you are.
2 Do you know why I'm here?	I've got a pretty good idea. You're here to kill me, so kill me. You want me to be afraid, but I'm not. I don't care who you are, or why you two killed my husband...

1 So all this... really was because of that soap opera? My son is dead because you came out here to be with that doctor? A fake doctor?	I wouldn't have put it quite that way, but...
2 Wesley didn't even want to come up here. He warned me, but I insisted...  I have to ask you, Betty...are you crazy?	I don't think I am.

1 Tell Del I'm sorry. I left so quick, but I need to do this.	Do what?
2 I gotta go.	Betty! Listen to me! Del is ...

1 I haven't been this happy since I was twelve years old.	What happened when you were twelve?
2 For Mother's Day, I used all my allowance that I'd been saving to take my mother to Kansas City. We got our nails done and had lunch at "Skies," a restaurant at the top of a building from where you can see the whole city. It was the last outing we took together. She died the following year.	Wow... You just gave me goosebumps, you know that? You make it all sound so real. Great improv...
3 I just want everything to be perfect between us.	I know. Listen, we need to take a time out here. Can we talk seriously for a minute?
4 Of course.	At last! I know how much you want this. You're gifted and extremely determined, but... it's not up to me.
5 I know. It's up to us.

1 Oh. Of course... sorry.	My treat. You were saying... something about how stupid you've been?
2 Right... I was. I was an idiot, plain and simple, and I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me. How's that?	Kinda like you'd been saying it since you got on the plane...
3 I have... did it sound that bad?	Mmm-hmm. Listen, I forgive you, Mr. McCord...
4 George...	...George. I do.  My best friend once said if you were any handsomer it would be a crime...
5 Thanks...	...it's too bad you're such an asshole. 'S the only thing that Del was ever right about.

1 Hi, Betty. You're looking good...	Thanks, Roy, you're sweet... a big liar, but sweet. I liked your editorial this morning...
2 Oh, appreciate it. I was trying to, ahh, give a sense of history to...

1 Let me tell you something. I got groped by these Tunisian guys who thought I was a slut for wearing shorts, it was hotter than stink the whole time, and I got some kind of weird gum disease from the water. Plus, it ended my marriage --	That's horrible!
2 No, he was a toad. Even more of a toad than Merle... I just wear the ring to keep the flies away. Rome was the best thing I ever did, because I DID IT! And I swear to you, it changed me. I've been to Rome, Italy! I sat every morning at the Cafe Sistina and had my cappuccino, and watched the pilgrims walk to mass, and no one can ever take that away from me.

1 No... I don't really know where he is yet. I'm at a hotel around the corner.	Man, that is love.

1 Either you're making a fool out of me because you get off on it, or you got serious problems. Which one is it?!	I have no idea what you're talking about.
2 I'M TALKING ABOUT DAVID RAVELL!!	Shhh! I heard you the first time.
3 I spent my weekend looking for someone who does -- not -- exist. I should have been here at the hospital with my brother, but I was with you.	If you didn't want to do it, you should have said so! Is this about gas money?
4 IT'S NOT ABOUT GAS MONEY!!  You have a thing for an actor on a stupid white soap opera, and we searched all over town for his character! Not the actor -- whose name is George, by the way. His character!

1 Are you sure I can borrow this?	No, please. Go ahead, it's your funeral...
2 Rosa...	Well, what if this guy's just playing with you? What if he's lying about who he is?
3 You should have a little faith in people.	Does he ever talk about medicine? His patients, the hospital?
4 All the time. It's always "Loma Vista" this, "Loma Vista" that.

1 What part of Dixie are you from, Duane?	Georgia. In case I didn't tell you, it's cash only, gentlemen.

1 All right... lemme see... okay, new Burger King opens up. These assholes get excited and start lining up. Like it's some five star restaurant. The place is mobbed. Right?	Hmmmm. "Five Stars," huh?  Is that stupid, Wesley?

1 I'm all for them owning casinos, getting rich off the white man's greed. It's a beautiful piece of irony, isn't it, Wesley?	IT SURE IS!!

1 So how do we know that car's still in Fair Oaks?	We don't. But a '97 Le Sabre'll be easy to find if it's here, town this size...  He said he gave his wife some car as a gift, remember?

1 That woman could be in any one of four states. Four big states where the deer and the antelope play, Wesley! We're not in Rhode Island!	I know that.
2 AND TURN THAT FUCKING MUSIC OFF!

1 This doesn't look like the kind of place Betty would go to.	Maybe she had to use the bathroom. She pees, doesn't she?!...

1 ...and how long did she work here?	Oh, five years, give or take.
2 Hmm... you two in high school together?	Aren't you a sweetheart... no, not quite. Anyway, she's been with us awhile.
3 But she wanted more out of life, right?	No... she just wanted something outta life. Anything. And with Del, she wasn't getting nothing. That's her husband, Del. I'm sorry about what happened and all, but that's the way I feel about all of this...
4 I see.  May I?	If it helps bring her back, be my guest...
5 Thank you for your cooperation.  Just one more thing... did she ever talk about getting rich?	...who doesn't?

1 Betty, I thought this would be the best way. You know, throw you into it...	What the hell's going on?
2 If you need a minute, that's okay. But I thought you'd want to --

1 You're wastin' your time, Roy.	Look Joyce, I need your key to the files, not advice, okay? This is a complex case.

1 I see.  Did Chloe testify?	I don't think she will. She's a slut, but I just don't think she's that mean. Jasmine'll bring her around...
2 Jasmine... Do you have yesterday's show on tape, by any chance?

1 You got light fingers, Everett. Gopher?	You mis'able little sneak thief...

1 ...but try getting a decent hair jelly.	Gopher, Everett?
2 And no transmission belt for two weeks neither.

1 What on earth is goin' on here! What's got into you, Delmar!	Caintcha see it Everett! Them sigh- reens did this to Pete! They loved him up an' turned him into a horney- toad!

1 Scuse me... scuse me... we're the next act...	Everett, my beard itches.

1 You don't know where his goddamn folks from; you speakin' outcha asshole.	Well now Pappy I wouldn't put it that strong...

1 Where's your ring, honey?	I ain't worn it since our divorce came through. It must still be in the rolltop in the old cabin. Never thought I'd need it; Vernon bought one encrusted with jewels.
2 Hell, now's the time to buy it off him cheap.	We ain't gettin' married with his ring!  You said you'd changed!
3 Aw, honey, our ring is just a old pewter thing -	Ain't gonna be no weddin'.
4 It's just a symbol, honey -	No weddin'.

1 How's this a plan? How're we gonna get a car?	Sell that. I figured it could only have painful associations for Wash.

1 Itta Bena, now, uh, that would be...	Isn't it, uh...

1 Well, it's a invitation-only affair; we'll have to sneak in through the service entrance-	Wait a minute - who elected you leader a this outfit? Since we been followin' your lead we got nothin' but trouble! I gotten this close to bein' strung up, n'consumed in a fire, 'n whipped no end, 'n sunstroked, 'n soggied -

1 ...Yeah?	Well people like that reform. Maybe we should get us some.

1 This is it. This is where I live. I suppose you could bunk over there and you could go to school at the base.	Great.
2 I'm not finished. I'll only be in port one week a month and when I'm here you'd never catch me playing daddy with you 'cause it's not who I am. Like I told you on the phone, you I'd be better off in that state school back in Virginia.	I ain't never going back to that school, sir.
3 You got to kid. Let me spell it out for you. This is a whorehouse. And I happen to like my life the way it is and nobody's gonna make me change.	I don't care about that. I just ain't going back. You don't want me? Okay. I'll find me another place.

1 That's not how she told it. She said you wrote her every week you were away.	I wrote. Not every week...
2 She said you told her in every letter how much you loved her, how you wanted to marry her, have children with her...	I never said any of that!
3 I found them, pard, and read them myself, right after she did it!	Okay, I wrote those things... and yeah, I had big thoughts of getting together with your mom... but when she hit me with being pregnant, I saw who she was. I'd had quiff lay that shit on me before!
4 What did you call her? What did I hear you call her, you son of a bitch?

1 Are you laughing at me, dick-brain?	No, sir!

1 I thought the D.I.'s were supposed to help you in this place! What kind of human being are you?	Stop eyeballing me, Mayo, or you're out!

1 Now when I say "understand" I want the whole group to say, "Yes, sir!" Understand?	Yes, sir!
2 Louder!	Yes, sir!!
3 I don't believe what I'm seeing! Where've you been all your lives, at an orgy? Listening to Mick Jagger and bad mouthing your country, I'll bet.

1 You're sure it's okay?	Don't worry. I'll respect you afterwards.

1 Far fucking out! I've been wanting to meet one of the Blue Angels since I can remember.	Lynette, watch your mouth! Somebody might overhear.
2 Paula, look at the new Poopies.	Yeah, I saw 'em. Poor guys.
3 See you in a month when you get liberty!	Don't worry. It grows out about an inch by them.

1 God! I've never seen anything like that in my whole life! Did you see that guy's nose?	Lynette, just keep your mouth shut until we get to the motel. Will you do that for me, please.
2 Well, excuse me for livin'!

1 You want me to fuck you? Is that it? Okay, come here. Take your clothes off. Get into bed.	Where's that coming from? I wouldn't fuck now if my life depended on it!
2 Forget it. Just get out of here.

1 I don't care what the magazines say... it's just not as easy being a girl, especially from a Catholic family. You don't know the junk I grew up listening to, 'bout the way women are supposed to think and act.	That's no excuse for not going after what you want.
2 Who says I'm not going after what I want? My mother's thirty-nine years old and she still works in that factory. Every time I see her, I know exactly what I don't want.

1 Your real father was an Officer candidate like me?	Twenty-two years ago.
2 No wonder he was looking at me like that.

1 Hey, do you guys ever... feel like you don't belong here...?	Yeah. All week long.

1 You okay?	Sure.

1 So what's the problem? Girls do that all the time.	I can't let her go off and have the kid by herself and not do anything. If it's my kid, too, then I've got a responsibility, don't I?
2 Not if she won't even talk about an abortion.	But it would still be my kid. That's the point.
3 Do you know that for sure?	It's mine.

1 What the fuck is funny about this?	God.
2 There is not one thing funny here.	Who else but God could think this shit up?  I spend ten years building those fucking rooms to keep people out, now I gotta figure out how to get in.  God, man, He just loves the irony.

1 The hell does she want?	I don't know, she keeps screamin' the same thing over and over.

1 WHO THE FUCK BREAKS IN THROUGH THE NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE?!	We've got the Kid!  WE'VE GOT YOUR KID!!  What the fuck is she thinking?!
2 She's got your gun, that's what she's thinking!  The FUCK you had to bring a gun for?!

1 It's still a good plan.  It's just... got a twist.	Yeah.  Kidnapping.
2 Not if we keep 'em here.  You can't kidnap somebody in their own house. It's just breaking and entering, unless we take 'em someplace.  Or something like that, I'm pretty sure.	Pure idiot.
3 I am.  I'm an idiot's son.  An idiot's grandson.  I'm third- generation idiot.  But for once in my life I had a good idea, and I'm not giving up so easy.  You are? Are you actually telling me that for the first time in your life you're gonna throw your cards on the table and go home early?  I can't believe my eyes.  Fourteen million dollars upstairs, Burnham.  You'll be out of the hole. Baby, you'll be so far out of the hole you could draw bricks every night for the next twenty years and still shit green.  Come on, Buddy.  One more hand.

1 We're not leaving.  I'm getting in that room, and I'm opening that safe.	Lookin' doubtful there, Big Guy, but ten out of ten for attitude.

1 Third floor, spare bedroom, den, what have you.  Mr. Pearlstine used it as an office.	He's talking about Bernard Pearlstine.

1 Push that button for me, will you?	Don't!

1 Old Bernie didn't miss a trick with this room, did he?	Open the door.
2 And with kids like he's got, no wonder he wanted a place to hide.

1 We're not coming out.  We're not letting you in.  Get out of my house. 	Say fuck.
2 Fuck.	"Get the fuck out of my house."
3 Get the fuck out of my house!

1 Do it.	Yeah, but where's the third guy?
2 Not in the bedroom.  Do it!

1 Alma!? I uhh I don't think...	What do you mean? We're black ain't we? And we care about improving the plight of out people don't we? Or you figure oppression stops at that thing dangling between your legs!
2 Uhh... I with it sister but...	But nothing, we want full fledged membership in the Black Panther Party... and none of this "Okay sugah as long as you stay in the background washing my socks and rubbing my feet" bullshit either!

1 Free? We're back where we started. Shit we still don't have a stop light.	Well as the Rev says, God helps those who help themselves.  We'll be our own stoplight.

1 Sit down, This concerns you too.  I don't need to say that your department's handling of the Black Panthers -- particularly Inspector Brimmer's "undercover operation" has been a complete travesty.	Just hold on a god damn minute. I...

1 God damn... Kid never had a chance...	Mothafuck... Hey!!! What the hell!!!

1 Man, did you see Huey down on Grove street? All up on that cop, that was beautiful.	Yeah, it was alright. Hey, can you give me a lift?
2 You got it. Berkeley?	No, Panther Headquarters.  Least that way we could hang out more like we used to.
3 You joining? My Brother..  My brother.

1 To be quite honest it turns my stomach.	Neither your stomach or your opinion matters here Dorsett... What matters is that Mr. Trafficante and the Bureau have come up with a solution to our Panther Problem. One might say...The Final Solution.

1 Shit, nothing but Paper Panthers.	Yeah... but it seems they're bringing Malcolm's widow Betty Shabazz to town, to speak at a rally, do an interview for Ramparts.  And they want us to help with security.

1 You were. infantry right?	Yeah.
2 So I guess it's safe to say you know about firepower.

1 Man, this shit's pretty thick.	You got that right. And brother, I got a feeling it's going to get a whole lot thicker.

1 Huh?	He had a feeling you'd be coming by.

1 You supposed to be a wounded vet, Motherfucka. What you do in 'Nam anyway, shoot gooks or shoot hoops?	All of the above, man...  And then some.

1 I'm sorry we didn't give you more warning.	It's alright.  I'm very happy for you.

1 Personally, I'd prefer stupidity.	Pride will do.

1 How did this... how did I let this happen?	You couldn't have known.
2 I should have known... once I would have... I used to be wary... and today I watched my son killed before my eyes... your sister civilized me and I damn myself for having let her...	Thomas is dead but you've done nothing for which you should be ashamed.
3 I've done nothing and for that I am ashamed.

1 Thank you.	Please accept my apology for not having done so sooner.
2 Apology accepted.  Now, on the matter of the specific targeting of officers during engagements, this is absolutely unacceptable.	That one is a bit more difficult.
3 Certainly you must know that in civilized warfare, officers in the field must not be accorded inappropriate levels of hostile attention.	And what are inappropriate levels of hostile attention?
4 Colonel, imagine the utter chaos that would result from un-led armies having at each other.  There must be gentlemen in command to lead and, when appropriate, restrain their men.	Restrain them from the targeting of civilians, including women and children?
5 That is a separate issue.	I consider them linked.
6 I beg to differ.  One is a command decision on your part.  The other represents nothing more than the occasional over-exuberance of field officers attempting to carry out their duty in difficult circumstances.	As long as your soldiers attack civilians, I will order the shooting of your officers at the outset of every engagement.  And my men are excellent marksmen.

1 The New York and Rhode Island assemblies have been dissolved...	The middle colonies?
2 Rioting both sides of the bay, in Chestertown they burned the Customs House and tar-and-feathered the Customs Agent.  He died of burns. In Wilmington they killed a Royal Magistrate and two Redcoats.	Anything about the convention in Philadelphia?
3 Poor Richard says they'll make a Declaration of Independence by July.

1 Alright, Corporal, you take Bennington, Harrisville, Acworth and the farms along Black Swamp.  I'll take the north side of the river. We'll meet at Snow's Island.	Yes, sir.

1 She said... she loves you and misses you but she understands why you can't be there with her.	She said that?  Oh, my Lord, she said that?

1 He wanted to, Susan, but he couldn't leave his men.	He left us.
2 I know he did and he's sorry.  He'll come back as soon as he can.

1 One of yours?	Gabriel.
2 I recognize him now.  Is he as imprudent as his father was at his age?	No, thank the Lord.  He's more like his mother.
3 I'll see to it that he serves under me.	Thank you.

1 Don't worry.	We could go stay at Aunt Charlotte's farm.  She's to the west.
2 No, there'll be skirmishers on the roads.  We're safer here.

1 If Cornwallis receives news that Clinton is coming, he'll simply hold tight and wait.  He'll fight a purely defensive battle and he'll win that.	No, he won't.  There are two things you need to know about Cornwallis. First, he is a very proud man, He would rather risk defeat than share a victory.  If you give him what he thinks is an out, he'll take it.
2 And what is the second thing?

1 Best never to go climbing on old blowdowns like this, Ellie--sometimes they bite.	Bite?
2 Ayuh.

1 Paxcow says Daddy's going to do something really bad. He--	Who is this Paxcow? Is he like the boogeyman?
2 He's a ghost. But he's a good ghost.

1 In the end he's gonna croak, isn't he?	Lovey...Church might be still alive when you're in a high school...and that's a very long time.
2 It doesn't seem long to me. It seems short. I think the whole thing about pets dying s-s-sucks!

1 But don't you dare say that.	I won't...is Missy in heaven, do you think?
2 I don't know, honey. Different people believe all sorts of different things happen to us when we die. Some believe in heaven or hell. Some think we're born again as little children--	Sure, carnation. Like in that movie you rented, Audrey Rose.
3 Well, it's actually reincarnation, but you get the idea. And some people think we just wink out...like a candle flame when the wind blows hard.	Do you believe that?

1 No--but if he drops by, I'll tell him to call you.	Jud, do you remember the name of the student that died on Louis's first day at work? The one that was hit by a car?

1 I can hardly read these.	Ayuh--they get older as you go toward the middle.  Pete LaVasseur's dog is buried there...  the Stoppard boys' racing pigeon that Missus Cowley's cat got...and I think that's the cat himself right there, although it's been so many years I can't tell for sure.  Missy Ellen! Come over here just a minute!

1 What say, Louis?	Nothing.  Do we plant him on the outer circle or start a new one?
2 We're still not where we're going.

1 Doesn't look like they last long.	Don't worry about that.
2 Jud, why am I doing all this?	Because it's right.

1 Out of the mouths of babes, Louis.	This babe has said enough.

1 I'll tell you where the ground is sour--the ground in my heart is sour. Let me tell you something else, Vic-baby: Wrong is wrong.	Timmy Baterman. That was wrong.
2 Don't talk like an asshole even if you are just a bit of underdone potato or a blot of mustard.

1 Don't be silly. Church is not going to die.	According to what Mr. Crandall says, the road's a lot more dangerous than the operation. Church will be just the same. Well--almost the same--and we won't have to worry about him getting turned into catburgers by one of those damn Orinco trucks.

1 You stole my boat.	AnaMaria!  Have you seen Gibbs?  I need to put together --

1 Allow me the humor of listening to your terms.	Simple.  I have something you won't more than anything.  The way to free you from the curse of the treasure.  You have something I want -- more than anything.
2 The Pearl?  Oh, that's fine.  And just how do you expect this to work?	You give me the Pearl.  Then I tell you who you need.

1 Why don't I want to do this?	Because, right about now, the H.M.S. Dauntless is lying in wait in the harbor.

1 No reason to fret.  It's just a prick of the finger and a few drops of blood.	Turner blood doesn't flow pure in his veins.  Best play it safe, and spill it all.
2 I guess there is a reason to fret.

1 Do you not know what this is, then?	It's a pirate medallion.
2 It's a piece of the treasure of Isla de Muerta.

1 No.  The pirates have taken Will --	Your father is frantic with worry. Our mission was to rescue you and return home.  That is what we shall do.  Mr. Turner's fate is regrettable.  But so was his decision to engage in piracy.
2 Commodore, please!

1 Elizabeth, this is hardly appropriate --	About the day we met. Do you remember?

1 You?!	Me!
2 You're in league with Barbossa!	No, I'm -- rescuing you.

1 When I get the Black Pearl back, I'm going to teach it to the whole crew, and we'll sing it all the time!	You'll be positively the most fearsome pirates to sail the Spanish Main.

1 Kid's a bit of a stick, isn't he?	That he is.

1 Raise the sails.	The wind is quarter from astern ... by the time we're underway, we'll never catch them.
2 We need only to come about, to put them in range of the long nines.

1 None?  Very well.  You rumbled me. I confess: I intend to commandeer one of these ships, pick up a crew in Tortuga, and go on the account, do a little honest pirating.	I said, no lies.

1 Who makes all these?	I do.  And I practice with them. At least three hours a day.
2 You need to find yourself a girl.  Or maybe the reason you practice three hours a day is you've found one -- but can't get her?

1 This is either crazy, or brilliant.	Remarkable how often those two traits coincide.

1 What's that?	Depends.
2 On what?	On whether the stories are all true.  If they are, that's a waterfall that spills over at high tide, with a short drop to an underground lagoon.  If not --

1 What's your business in Port Royal, 'Mr. Smith'?	And no lies!

1 Look, I don't mean to rain on everyone's ascension here, but we got a little problem.	Speak.
2 Dr. Bright has escaped.

1 Pollution?	Do you know what I see?  I see man making his own clouds.  I see man coloring his own sky, and like this garden it is a site that makes my heart sing.

1 As you can see I am a new man, just like you.	Oh no.  You're not like me.  In fact, I'm betting you're the same greedy, remorseless, egomaniacal bad guy you always were.

1 A containment crew is going to attract a lot of attention.	You're right.  Place a call to our friends at the network and to Mr. Joplin at the E.P.A.

1 I was wondering if you'd finished considering?	Considering what?
2 What I asked you earlier?

1 Dr. Makeo is working on it now, sir. I estimate at least another six hours.	In the meantime, why don't you find something useful for Dr. Bright to do.

1 Yeah, somebody broke in and stole the samples, one of those animal rights groups, right?  I remember now, they freed all the monkeys which caused that huge pileup on the Massachusetts Turnpike, right?	Yeah.  But it wasn't a group.  It was one man.
2 That's the guy?

1 What's it smell like?	Smell?  Uh, something like methylcyanoacrylate.
2 Like Crazy Glue?	Yes.  That's it.  He's got it.  Oh God, he's got it!

1 Nothing really worthwhile.	That's what I thought.

1 Oh no, no, no!  You've got to be able to fix me!  Please, Susan, tell me you can make me normal again!	Once the subject was polymerized we were unable to reassemble the original organic structure.

1 So right now there's little replicators spreading throughout Argon's lab?	That's right.
2 Isn't it already too late then?

1 I want you to know that I really appreciate you helping me.	I'm glad you came to me for help.

1 Did you go?	On the counter.

1 Daniel, just forget Argon.  Let's get out of here.  We'll find another way to stop the waste.	We don't have time to argue, Susan.

1 That's impossible.	It's a miracle.

1 If this nutcase did take it and has half a brain, he'd use it right away, before we could invalidate it.	Yes, that is what I was thinking.
2 In fact, would it be safe to say, based on your general knowledge of this character, that he is already in the building?	Yes, he might be.

1 You're not going to print this silly thing, are you?	No? Why not?

1 Oh, I don't need another guess. It's quite obvious.	So, it's obvious, huh?

1 Now Mother, your attitude is perfectly ridiculous. It's done now. Stewart and I are married.	I'm afraid she's right, Mrs. Schuyler. I'm really very sorry, Mrs. Schuyler, that you feel this way. I was in hopes that you would like me. I'm not the burglar that you think I am. After all, we're married. I think the thing to do is to kiss and make up - Mother.

1 Oh, yes you will my dear - oh, yes you will my dear - you'll eat spinach but you'll wear garters too!	Oh, you can't carry a tune - you can't carry a tune - all you are good for is to sit and spoon, spoon. Oh no, I won't wear garters
2 Oh yes you will wear garters

1 Anne, come here. Listen	Look out for my lipstick, Stewart.
2 I'll tell you what. Let's you and me sneak out all by ourselves	Are you crazy?
3 Think of the fun we can have - we'll sneak down the back stairs and get in the valet's Ford. How's that?	Will you stop being silly, Stewart?
4 I'll tell you what let's do - I'll take you and introduce you to all my gang. Would you like that?	But I don't want to meet your gang.
5 I don't mean the newspaper fellows that you don't like. Another gang I know - you'd love them. They're writers and musicians and artists - a great crowd of people - people who do great things. People who are worthwhile.	Meaning, my friends aren't worthwhile, I suppose?
6 Oh, they're all right, Anne. But I	That's exactly what you mean. Heaven knows you've made that clear to me often enough. Well, I'm sick and tired of it. I've given you party after party - I've taken you to some of the best houses in this town - and introduced you to people of importance - and are you grateful? No! You insult them and act like a bore. I'm sick and tired of having to make excuses for you and the things that you've done. Perhaps it's just as well you're not coming tonight. Maybe I can enjoy myself for once without having to worry about you, and what you're going to do.

1 Good morning, Mother. Didn't I tell you that he'd be marvelous. Everybody thought he was so charming last night.	I was so worried for fear he'd knock over a vase or something. I must have acted like an idiot.  What does it say about the reception last night?
2 Oh, the usual thing. Blah, blah, blah attended the blah, blah reception and wore the same blah, blah things.	Stop it. Anne. You're behaving like the person you're married to.
3 You don't have anything to complain about, Mother. He was all right last night, wasn't he? I told you not to worry about him.	It was a miracle. The man was ill or something.

1 Yeah!	But right now I'm acting in the capacity of Mrs. Schuyler's attorney.
2 Oh, that's all right with me. I won't hold it against you. But you see, I'm here to find out about	I know, I know. But there's no truth in the story whatsoever.
3 Oh yeah?

1 Well, Stew, that's all thrashed out. By golly, I'm surely glad to see that you're not really sore. You know our racket - after all, news is news.	Sure, sure. That's all right. That was a great story, Bingy. A great story - wish I'd printed it.
2 I gave you the breaks, didn't I? That hairy chest story!	You've raised it up to the chin, I see.  Go on in the other room and get yourself a drink.

1 Just a boid in a gilded cage -	A what?
2 You heard me. A bird in a gilded cage.	Aw, you've been reading a lot of cheap tabloids. Anne and myself are going to move downtown in a nice little flat, we're gonna forget all about this social stuff, and we're gonna be known as Mr. and Mrs. Stew Smith. How do you like that?
3 And live on your salary, I suppose?	Yeah, live on my salary - that is, until I finish writing my play.
4 What play?	My play.
5 The one about the Siberian bloodhound?	Siberian bloodhound?  No. That's been all rewritten. It's laid in Araby now.
6 Araby?	Sure.
7 Araby, my eye!

1 I think I understand, sir. You mean you want me to go?	There you are. You caught on. You see, you're nice and you're smart too. You caught on right away. Outside! Go on! Outside! And don't come back!

1 Sure, sure. You've got a nose, Gallagher. You've got a nose. But there's different women, Gallagher. You know, like brewery horses and thoroughbreds.	On now, Stew, don't be too hard on her. I wouldn't call her a brewery horse.
2 Gallagher! She's the real McCoy!	And the rest of us are truck horses?
3 There you go, talking like a woman!	Well!
4 Well, you're my pal, aren't you? Then don't turn female on me.

1 Gee Gallagher, do you look good! What are you doing to yourself?	Nothing.
2 What did you do to that hair? And where did you get that dress?	I dyed one and washed the other.
3 Oh, you dyed one and washed the other. Well! You certainly look good.

1 Did who?	Conrad.
2 What do you know about Conrad?	I don't know a thing about him, but isn't he the one you're always yelling about?

1 A statement? Good.	I have it here.
2 Good.

1 Fine, but kinda thirsty.	Come right in - I'll get you a drink.
2 Okay - you remember Joe	Sure.
3 I sort of invited him along to bend an elbow. You don't mind, do you?	It's all right. Bring him in.

1 As a matter of fact, I was just trying to decide the color of Anne's eyes. I can't tell whether they're blue, or whether they're violet. What would you say, Mrs. Schuyler?	Why

1 But I	Now the lady said you may go

1 I just love you in that sweater Mary-Sue. It's so flattering.	Thanks.

1 Why no. She's still on her date with Biff ... is something the matter?	No, I ... I was just ... worried about her.

1 Oh, hello Betty.	Hello Bill.

1 You can't go out there.	But I really should get home.
2 But you can't go out there.

1 I made a couple of lunches for you and put them in brown paper bags ...  I'm gonna go now.	Where are you gonna go?
2 I'm gonna go now.

1 Mary Sue--C'mon ...	What are you doing?
2 It's six-thirty ...	So.
3 We were gonna ... You know ...

1 I'm sure you've noticed the same things we all have--certain "changes" going on in the town.  You know what I mean by "changes"?	"Changes."
2 "Changes."  And it's not just the fire or big stuff like that. It's little things.  Did you hear about Bill Miller?	No. What?
3 Wife wants him to get one of those new beds.	One of those ... big beds?

1 Do you further admit that this was done surreptitiously and under the cover of darkness?	Well--it was dark out ...
2 Good. Do you further admit that this unnatural depiction occurred in full public view where it was accessible to, and in plain sight of, minor children?	It was accessible to everyone.
3 Very well. Let the record show that the defendants have answered in the affirmative to all the charges.

1 "It was big 'n brown 'n kept goin' an' goin' as far you could see."	I thought the books were blank?

1 What did you do?	I don't know.
2 Uchh! Look at me?! I'm like so ... pasty!

1 JENNIFER!	Just watch. You know why those guys just get cats out of trees? 'Cause nothing burns around here, that's why! They don't need any firemen ...

1 Um ... They like wanna ask you a question ... I didn't know how to handle it. So ...	Sure.

1 That was sure swell ...	Oh. Thanks, Margaret.
2 I baked you my oatmeal cookies.	Oh, no ... You baked those for Whitey.
3 No. I baked them for you.	No. You baked them for Whitey.
4 No. I baked them for you.

1 I picked them myself. They grow wild up here.  Mmm. So sweet.	They just grow like that?
2 Oh yeah. There's a lot of stuff. Currants and strawberries ... Here. I'll show you.

1 You're unbelievable. You'll win this thing for sure. When is it on?	Marathon starts at 6:30. Contest's tomorrow at noon.
2 A thousand dollars ... And it's on all night?	Of course it is Howard. That's why they call it a Marathon.

1 Don't get upset.	Weil wouldn't you! You look for someone for years ... You pour your heart into it ... This is a privilege you know.  I don't think I better talk about this right now.
2 Where are you going ...	I don't think we should discuss this until I'm a little bit more composed.
3 WAIT A MINUTE!!	Maybe in a day or so when I'm not so emotional ...
4 COME BACK!!!

1 Okay, let's cut the shit and get right to it. Where's that remote control?	Why?
2 Because you're coming home.	Why don't you just take me back without it?
3 Oh. You're a smart little bastard aren't you?  It's kind of like a restricted ticket. You gotta leave the same way you came.

1 Do you have the lettuce?	... Yeah.
2 Have you cooked the burgers?	Yes.
3 Well you can just put on the lettuce, finish the burger and pretend it was me doing it all along.

1 It's an art book.	Oh my Gosh, Bud ...
2 Open it.

1 Told you it was your lucky day. Bet you thought I was just a fan or something.	What happened?
2 A miracle.

1 It's extension 215 if you want to try me back.	Ok. Thank you.

1 Yeah I can't.	OH MY GOD. Look at that.

1 Hello?	We got disconnected before....
2 No. No. We got disconnect -- why?.....you're calling me at work....how did you get this number -- ?	See the thing is I could make it really easy on you -- I already have your credit card number, your information, address and stuff. This is so awkward asking like this, I'm sorry --
3 This makes me very uncomfortable.	I need help.
4 Should I just ask your girlfriend?  Maybe I should call back and talk to your girlfriend?	I don't have a girlfriend --
5 -- you said you did.	I know I did. But I don't.
6 You lied to me?	I didn't lie.
7 Why did you tell me you did, then?	This is....illegal....I'll call the police.
8 No you won't.

1 What do you do with all this pudding?	That's not mine it's one of the guys that works here. That pudding's not mine.

1 Is everything ok?	Yes.
2 What happened?	Nothing.
3 What did he want?	Nothing.

1 Oh my god, you are so adorable. I just....god dammit.	What's that? What is that that you're doing?
2 I just...your face is so adorable and your cheek and your skin, I wanna bite it....I wanna bite your cheek and chew on it....god damn cute....fuck....	I know what you mean, I know what you mean, I get this feeling --
3 ...what...?	IIIIIIIIIII don't want to hurt anything ever, but what I'm talking about is -- have you ever held a little puppy or a little kitten and it's just the cutest, softest, most precious thing in the world and out of the blue you get this feeling in your gut and all you wanna do is squeeze it. Just fuckin squeeze the shit out of it. To take a little puppy and smash its skull...just so precious, so beautiful. Just so god damn wonderful and cute you wanna smack it and kick it and love it. Fuck. I don't know. I don't know. And you, you.....I'm looking at you and I just....your face is so beautiful I just wanna smash it, just smash it with a sledgehammer and squeeze it...you're so pretty.

1 Can I pay you here? Can I pay you for our drinks and salad?	That's fine.

1 How you doin' Barry?	Hi Walter.
2 How's business?	Business is very food, thanks. ELIZABETH What's very food?

1 Good morning, Barry....	Hi, Lance.
2 What's with all this pudding, what is this?

1 You made a phone call and you said you'd help a girl out and then you didn't....I'm here to get the money.	Wait a minute --
2 No, no, no, no c'mon man, don't make it a thing --	Please don't do this.
3 It's just you need to give me the money...do you have it right now?

1 This is this place called Ace Vintage, you gotta find it, I don't know exactly where this is and I don't understand these maps so just go there and check it out. It's a '61 AC Cobra that this old guy says is fine, but I need to figure out why he's only asking 23 for it. So take a look, the whole thing, call me about that, if it seems alright then I'll head down there and check it out.	Ok.
2 That's it.	Can we maybe ask for more money on this?

1 So I'll meet you at the restaraunt?	Ok.

1 Yes, well, I awoke to discover I'd turned into a cat. If you don't do as I say, I'll sink my little fangs into your drumsticks, and suck the marrow straight out of your bones.	At your service, Count.
2 Now give the signal.

1 In part, yes.	He's not the man who's cast a shadow here.

1 Care for a splash of wine, Abbe?	It's not even noon --
2 Conversation, like certain portions of the anatomy, always runs more smoothly when it's lubricated.

1 Start with the Bible; it's cheerier, and more artfully written.	That monstrous God of yours? He strung up his very own son like a side of veal; I shudder to think what He'd do to me.
2 You know what sacrilege is, don't you? The last refuge of the failed provocateur.

1 It's a potent aphrodisiac, isn't it? Power over another man.	Your wig. Remove your wig.

1 He's made a great success of our Little Theater; there's seldom an empty seat. Not to mention its therapeutic value.	Playing dress-up with cretins? That sounds like a symptom of madness; not its cure.

1 Madame Bougival; Mademoiselle Clairwil -- and of course -- the Marquis' wife --	Oh indeed?

1 I've stared into the face of evil...  ...and I've lived to tell the tale. Now... for your own sake... let me write it down.	Gibberish, my friend. He rants and he raves --

1 My darling, Eugenie, dainty morsel! Get on your back! Let's try it dorsal!	Was ever a man more risqu? He wants to take me every way!

1 The unhappy tale of a virginal laundry lass, the darling of the lower wards, where they entomb the criminally insane.	Is it awfully violent?
2 Most assuredly.	Is it terribly erotic?
3 Fiendishly so.

1 It needn't be; not if you've another story.	How do you propose I write it? With dust, upon the air?
2 You could whisper it through the walls of your cell.

1 Don't toy with me, Doctor.	Now is the time to secure your epitaph. The benevolent Marquise, Charenton's most revered philanthropist... or Satan's Bride.

1 Everywhere I go, they point and whisper! At the opera, they hiss at me when I take my box. When I went to church... the priest refused to even hear my confession; he said I was already damned! Why must I suffer for your sins?	It's the way of all martyrs, isn't it?
2 Give me back my anonymity, that's all I ask! Let me be invisible again!

1 It's not so bad here. After all, what girl doesn't want to live in a castle?	Mr. Welles certainly is a caution
2 Yeah, Orson's a real piece of work. But deep down, he's a good kid. Real deep down.	And attractive in a hammy sort of way.
3 Mm.

1 And maybe we could get Mr. Warner and Mr. Goldwyn and Mr. Cohn and Mr. Selznick to play as well.	You know that can't happen.
2 Oh, why is that?	Why is that, Louis?
3 Bel Air is restricted.

1 Well -- he got us, didn't he? She stands and goes quickly to pour a drink. A forced laugh	Nailed us, hub? The crazy old man and his whore.
2 Marion--	Bought and p-p-paid for. Just like one of his goddamn statues. Well at least in the movie he married her!
3 This picture--	I am not that woman.

1 "Well, if you got drunk to talk to me about Miss Alexander, don't bother. I'm not interested. I've set back the sacred cause of reform, is that it? All right, if that's the way they want it, the people have made their choice. It's obvious the people prefer Jim Gettys to me."	"You talk about the people as if you owned them. As though they belonged to you. As long as I can remember, you've talked about--"  Orson, I am so goddamn tired--

1 I don't know what you expected with Joseph- fucking-Conrad for Chrissake. I mean this is Hollywood, pal.	All right! Enough! I've heard this from Schaefer and RKO. I've heard it from everyone--
2 But you keep coming up with the same elitist crap - - HEART OF DARKNESS with a million dollar budget?! - - no one wants to see that.	Nonsense

1 Mank! You scoundrel! What took you so long?!	Orson, please ... it's too bright

1 The key -- the key -- the clue -- what does this man recall on his death bed? Okay, Mank, you're dying. What's the last image that comes to you? Right now.	This girl on a dock. White dress. Never said a word to her.
2 Why her?	She was . . . innocent

1 Hey, kid. Gregg.	Mank, sit down. You missed the opening of the new picture but I'll go back--
2 No, you gotta hear this-

1 He truly doesn't care if he ever works again.	Yeah, ain't it swell?

1 "Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud."	Again

1 Do you every think for one second that you might have some responsibility for what you're doing?! For cutting and slashing everything in your way so you can have your goddamn movie?!	That soulless monster gets no tears from me.
2 Who the fuck are you trying to kid? You are that soulless monster.

1 Oh, no--	Yes!
2 He's Christ?	I'm Christ
3 You want to do the life of Jesus?	Yes! Vibrant and modern and stark like a Picasso sketch drawn to flashes of lightning I We shoot the whole thing in the gallant American West--

1 J.R., glad you could make it.	You were great, Jake. Just like old times. Good thing Sugar Ray wasn't here tonight. Oh Jake, this is State's Attorney Bronson and his wife.

1 I'm tellin' you, she'll be there, I know she'll be there.	'Cause I wanna catch her alone.
2 How you gonna catch anybody alone at a dance?... I don't know if she'll be there alone... She'll probably be there with her girlfriends or something.	She ever go with them? Like Salvy?
3 Nah, she don't go with nobody. She's only 15 years old.	What does that have to do with it? She don't look 15 to me. I heard somethin' with Salvy. She was with him once or somethin', I think. It was like some blonde. That's the one...
4 Probably. You know she talks to everybody, and not just him.	Yeah, she's nice.
5 Ah, some piece of ass, I'm tellin' you.	You wasn't with her, were you?
6 Huh?	You wasn't with her?
7 With her? How?	You know, like bang her or anything?
8 Ah, no, no. I didn't bang her. I know her from around here, that's all. You want to meet her or what?	Nah, not now -- all those hard-ons around. I'll wait. Not now.

1 Whatcha doin'?	I remember the first time I met Vickie... I know there's somethin' up. I know she's doin' somethin', but I can't catch her...
2 Maybe she's afraid you're gonna hit her so she can't talk to you the way she wants to.	What do you mean?
3 Try talkin' to her. She's your wife -- ask her what's the matter.	When I'm away, did you ever notice anythin' funny with her? Tell me the truth.
4 Jack, if there was anything funny, I would tell you.	I want you to keep an eye on her when I'm not here. Understand?
5 Sure, I'll keep an eye on her.	What did Tommy say?
6 I got good news, and I got bad news. The good news is you got your shot at the title. The bad news is...	Yeah, I know.

1 Was Vickie part of the deal with Tommy? Was my wife part of the deal? Tell me, was that it?	Stop it. What're you, crazy?

1 You don't talk very much.	I ain't ever talked to a movie star before.
2 I ain't no movie star. I'm just in high school.	Oh no? I thought you was a movie star.

1 I like the gym smell.	Now take your panties off.

1 Jake, no --	Do I have to kill you, eh?  Do I have to kill somebody to get an answer?  I know about you at the Copa. I know all about it.

1 Open the door, Vickie.	No. I won't talk to you where you can use your hands on me.
2 Aw, c'mon. Don't say that.	I got a lawyer, Jake. We're getting a divorce. I'm getting custody of the kids.
3 Aw, c'mon, Vick --	I'm sick of it. I can't watch you this way. You're too drunk all the time. There's too many girls. I can't... I don't wanna talk about it. I made up my mind.

1 I can't convince him. He's got such a thick head, I'd like to crack it open myself. Believe me, my own brother. It's very hard. You don't have to convince me -- I know we should be with Tommy. You talk to him. He don't listen to nobody.	Look, I'm just tellin' you how Tommy feels. Jake is makin' it hard on himself. Tommy wants him with us. It's as simple as that.

1 Of course, it's normal for a man to tie his trunk up with a heavy rope.	When the lock is broken -- yes.

1 Who said they left then?	Who left -- where?
2 The Thorwalds -- at six in the morning?

1 Oh -- that phone call!  I gave them your number -- hope you don't mind.	That depends on who "they" were.
2 The police Department at Merritsville. They called to report. The trunk was just picked up -- by Mrs. Anna Thorwald.

1 Well -- did you get it, Thorwald?	Who are you?
2 I'll give you a chance to find out. Meet me in the bar at the Brevoort -- and do it right away.	Why should I?
3 For a little business meeting -- to settle the estate of your late wife.	I don't know what you mean.
4 Now stop wasting time, Thorwald, or I'll hang up and call the police.	I only have a hundred dollars or so.
5 That's a start. I'm at the Brevoort now. I'll be looking for you.

1 You're never going to marry?	Probably. But when I do, it'll be to someone who thinks of life as more than a new dress, a lobster dinner, and the latest scandal. I need a woman who'll go anywhere, do anything, and love it.

1 A Federal offense.	Get back there! He'll see you!

1 I wonder.	What?
2 Miss Lonely Hearts just laid out something that looks like sodium trieckonal capsules.	You can tell that from here?
3 I handled enough of those red pills to put everybody in New Jersey asleep for the winter.	Would four of them -- ?
4 No -- but it makes the rest easy to take. And she's reading the Bible.	Then I wouldn't worry too much. But let's keep an eye on her.

1 Hello.	Mrs. Doyle?
2 Yes.	Jeff again.  Has Tom come in yet?
3 Not yet, Jeff.	You haven't even heard from him?
4 Not a word.

1 I couldn't think of anything more boring and tiresome than what you've been through. And the last week must be the hardest.	Yeah -- I want to get this thing off and get moving.
2 Well, I'm going to make this a week you'll never forget.

1 Lisa, simmer down -- will you?	You can't fit in here -- I can't fit in there. According to you, people should be born, live an die on the same --
2 Lisa! Shut up!

1 What do you think?	Something too frightful to utter.

1 All day long I've tried to keep my mind on work.	Thinking about Thorwald?
2 And you, and you friend Doyle --  Did you hear from him again -- since he left?	Not a word. He was going to check on the railroad station, and the trunk. He must be still on it.

1 From his landlord -- once a month.	It's utterly beautiful.  I wish I could be creative.
2 You are. You have a talent for creating difficult situations.	I do?
3 Staying the night here, uninvited.

1 Well?	It's just a picture of the backyard, that's all.
2 I know. But there's one important change. The flowers in Thorwald's pet flower bed.

1 What's that?	A new disease.
2 Friend of yours?	I'm glad they let you out.
3 Nobody chickened.	I heard about it.  You're lucky he lived.
4 They always live.

1 Where can we meet?	Know the Millertown bluff?

1 Mother--	You make any sandwiches?
2 My first day of school, mother'd make me eat and by golly I could never even swallow till recess--

1 I don't think so--	Well--

1 You sure?	I think I know my son.

1 Is he there?	No, honey.  No, he's not here.

1 I think his first name's Ray--I have to see him.  It's very important.	What's the charge?

1 How'd you get here?	I hitched.
2 Boy, I bet you'd go to a hanging.	My personality's showing again. Should I leave?
3 No.  It's okay.

1 How do you know so much about this junk, Plato?	I had to go to a head-shrinker.  I only went twice though.  My mother said it cost too much, so she went to Hawaii instead.

1 Can I keep it?	What do you think?

1 What happened, darling.  We were so worried.  I was going to take a sleeping pill, but I wouldn't till I knew you were home.	I have to talk to someone, Mom.  I have to talk to you both.  And Dad this time you got to give me an answer.

1 Too bad you didn't connect.  You could have gone to Juvenile Hall. That's what you want, isn't it?	No.
2 Sure it is.  You want to bug us till we have to lock you up.  Why?	Leave me alone.
3 No.	I don't know why--!
4 Go on--don't give me that.  Someone giving you hard looks?	I just get so--  Boy, sometimes the temperature goes way up. RAY  Okay.  Okay.  Let it out.

1 Hi.  I saw you before.	Bully for you.
2 You don't have to be unfriendly.	Now that's true!
3 See?	"Life is crushing in on me."
4 "Life can be beautiful." Hey, I know where it was.	Where what was.
5 Where I saw you.  Everything going okay now?  You live around here?	Who lives?
6 See, I'm new.	Won't mother be proud.
7 You're really flipped--aren't you.

1 You can trust me, Judy.	I feel as if I'm walking under water.

1 No!	We have to go back!
2 No!  I got to find him.

1 What makes you think he hates you, Judy?	I don't think.  I know.  He looks at me like I'm the ugliest thing in the world.  He doesn't like my friends--he--

1 So. This is the guy you been waiting for. Man of your dreams.	Gabriel -- !
2 Must have a way with stationery.	Gabriel, what are you doing!

1 All those letters are about to pay off, baby... all those letters...	To all those cons...
2 Searching for a money man...	We musta written what, twenty of 'em? And they were before this guy. One, two letters apiece, ten to the racetrack guy in Leavenworth --
3 -- till he fucked his parole --	-- plus the forty to Mason... how many letters is that?
4 That's a book, baby.  That's a book of love.

1 Do that again.	What.
2 Smile.

1 Well, I don't know about that --	Blackjack, Nick, blackjack I am good at. I mean, they'd give us some free games or something, wouldn't they? Since you worked there?
2 Security, Ash, I just worked security. They wouldn't be rolling out the red carpet --	And the slots, slots I'm good at too. Wouldn't that be fun?
3 We'll have more fun in Detroit.	We could live it up and --
4 Ashley. We're not going anywhere I used to work.

1 He'll kill you.	You're not hearing me here --
2 My brother's killed people, I know he has. Truckers. If you talk him into thinking you're not you, you'll only get yourself dead.	He didn't "find" Nick's letters, did he.
3 Nick, please, it's me --	You told him about Nick's letters.
4 No, Nick, no --	You're in on this.
5 I love you!

1 So does it look a lot different?	Here and there. Restaurant, uh, that's the main expansion. Tables've been moved around; the big man's office, I dunno, might be upstairs now.

1 He wants to see your map.	I'm almost done.
2 He says he wants it now.	If he wanted a photographic memory, he shoulda kidnapped one. I'm working on it here.

1 You... you don't know me --	Oh, I know you, Nick. I know you real well.
2 No, you can't --	The hell I can't.

1 How much money's in that casino? Day-to-day.	I don't know.
2 The hell you don't.	Five million?
3 You wrote Ash that letter, you told her that story 'bout working Christmas Eve, bout how they'd send half the security guys home, nobody comin, in that night. And the rest of you got shit-faced drinking hot buttered rum. That a true story now?	Christmas... Eve...
4 You know where the guards are. You know how to get in and out. You know where the money is.  We're taking down that casino, convict. You're the guy gonna tell us how.

1 A cowboy. You're going to send me into an Indian casino disguised as a cowboy. Have you thought this entirely through?	Put it on.

1 It's time for me... to be working for me. I want mine, Nick. And I need you.  Did you tell your manager there's gonna be a robbery?	No, Gabriel... no...

1 You are lucky, convict. You're spending Christmas with the birthday boy himself --	Hey! HEY! THERE IS A POWWOW SAFE!

1 THE POWWOW SAFE! WHERE IS THE POWWOW SAFE!	What... Powwow...
2 The Powwow Safe where you steal your money! Where you cheat your Indians!	I don't steal any --

1 That motherfucker --	And Monster... he was talking with the casino manager. Nick was talking to him.

1 What you gotta worry about first is the guards. Place doesn't look much richer than when I worked there, so let's figure you're gonna have to deal with ten of 'em. There'll be two on the floor, walking the room, that leaves eight up above. Eyes in the sky. They see something up, they're the ones who'll hit the silent alarm and you're fucked.	How do we take them out?
2 You gotta get someone upstairs.	How do we do that?

1 Why you gotta say a thing like that.	I'm just saying.
2 Why you gotta. We were gonna give you a ride someplace, man. Now I just don't know.	I'm just talking.
3 Fuck your hot chocolate, Rudy.

1 GUARD! GUARD!	Alamo...
2 GUARD!!!

1 Watch your mouth, man. It's Christmas.	I'M NOT NICK!

1 I don't wanna lift crates.	You don't hafta lift shit. You don't really work there. But as far as the records are concerned, you do. I call up Matthews, the foreman, tell him he's got a new guy. You're on the schedule. You got a timecard, it's clocked in and out for you everyday, and you get a pay check at the end of the week. And ya know dock workers don't do too bad. So you can move into a halfway decent place without Scagnetti thinkin "what the fuck." And if Scagnetti ever wants to make a surprise visit, you're gone that day. That day we sent you to Tustin. We gotta bunch of shit you needed to unload there. You're at the Taft airstrip pickin' up a bunch of shit and bringing it back. Part of your job is goin' different places - and we got places all over the place.

1 We can work this out, can't we?	This isn't all that bad. We can give you a lot of legitimate jobs. Put you on the rotation at Long Beach as a dock worker.

1 He's right about the ear, it's hacked off.	Let me say this out loud, just to get it straight in my mind. According to you, Mr. Blonde was gonna kill you. Then when we came back, kill us, grab the diamonds, and scram. That's your story? I'm correct about that, right?

1 Myself and Mr. Pink?	You two take the manager in the back and make him give you the diamonds. We're there for those stones, period. Since no display cases are being fucked with, no alarms should go off. We're out of there in two minutes, not one second longer. What if the manager won't give up the diamonds?
2 When you're dealing with a store like this, they're insured up the ass. They're not supposed to give you and resistance whatsoever. If you get a customer or an employee who thinks he's Charles Bronson, take the butt of your gun and smash their nose in. Drops 'em right to the floor. Everyone jumps, he falls down, screaming, blood squirts out his nose. Freaks everybody out. Nobody says fuckin' shit after that. You might get some bitch talk shit to ya. But give her a look, like you're gonna smash her in the face next. Watch her shut the fuck up. Now if it's a manager, that's a different story. The managers know better than to fuck around. So if one's givin' you static, he probably thinks he's a real cowboy. So what you gotta do is break that son-of-a-bitch in two. If you wanna know something and he won't tell you, cut off one of his fingers. The little one. Then you tell 'im his thumb's next. After that he'll tell ya if he wears ladies underwear. I'm hungry, let's get a taco.

1 Wong?	Fuck you, wrong. I'm right! What the fuck do you know about it anyway? You're still listening to Jerry- fucking-Vale.
2 Not wrong, dumb ass, Wong! You know, like the Chinese name?

1 I'll take care of this, you guys leave the tip.  And when I come back, I want my book back.	Sorry, it's my book now.
2 Blonde, shoot this piece of shit, will ya?

1 I know.	You do?
2 Your name's Freddy something.	Freddy Newendyke.
3 Frankie Ferchetti introduced us once, about five months ago.	Shit. I don't remember that at all.
4 I do.  How do I look?

1 Hey, just cancel that shit right now! You're hurt. You're hurt really fucking bad, but you ain't dying.	All this blood is scaring the shit outta me. I'm gonna die, I know it.
2 Oh excuse me, I didn't realize you had a degree in medicine. Are you a doctor? Are you a doctor? Answer me please, are you a doctor?	No, I'm not!

1 I'd go over twelve percent for that.	Look, I ordered coffee. Now we've been here a long fuckin' time, and she's only filled my cup three times. When I order coffee, I want it filled six times.

1 So, is he dead or what?	He ain't dead.
2 So what is it?	I think he's just passed out.
3 He scared the fuckin' shit outta me. I thought he was dead fer sure.

1 I told ya he'd be pissed.	What are you gonna do about him?

1 Tell them to come on in.	But I'm going to have to leave 'em here. They're --- well they're not the sort of people you're used to.
2 It doesn't matter who they are.	And one of 'em is sick.
3 Why didn't you say so. Go right out and get her. Ed. build the fire up.

1 And this is Helen Carter.	I'm Clay Phillips.  My brother Steve.

1 But the nearest shelter's the Wyatt ranch and that's maybe five hours away.	Can we get a doctor at that ranch?
2 No, Ma'am, we can't. We can get a roof and a fire and maybe Mrs. Wyatt knows something about taking care of sick people.

1 Don't you trust me?	Not on this trail, I don't. I've been over it before. Anyway, you ought to be pretty sleepy. Why don't you climb in back.

1 Go on, take it. Then you can't spend the rest of the trip expecting to get paid.	There won't be any rest of the trip. Over the hill is a stage road and when we hit it you get dumped into the first stage that comes along. So keep your money. You'll need it for the fare. I'm fed up with you. I was fed up with you before we started.

1 That job you were talkin' about, did you get it yet?	Why?
2 Because... well, you said you wanted a man to think enough of you to walk in the place you were working and take you out of there... tonight I was sort of tied up with Steve... but tomorrow I figured on doing just that.	I haven't got the job yet.

1 You might tell a fellow things, 'specially if the fellow's your brother, seems to me.	Like what?

1 There was only three of them at first. I guess I lost my head.	How'd you happen to miss?
2 They were quite a ways off and the wind was blowin'. I didn't have them to aim.	Good thing you didn't.

1 Go on, hit me.	Sit down and eat. Till I say the word, you're doing what you're told.
2 You oughta say you're sorry -- that's what you oughta do.	You keep your nose out of my life, young fella.
3 Maybe I haven't lived as long as you have, but I know a sight more about people and I wouldn't talk to a mule like you talked to her and, if I did, I'd say how sorry I was. I'd be man enough to do that.

1 I'm sorry about this, Mr. Wyatt. I didn't know who she was.	All right, you didn't know.
2 I can't take her with me.	Nobody asked you to.

1 You got no business snoopin' around --	Me snoopin'? I came down here to take a bath.

1 When I ask questions, I like to hear answers.	They went on like I told you.

1 How long do you think we'll have to stay here?	Until Pa gets around to driving us to Minden.
2 We don't want to go there.	No we don't. But that's where we're going. From Minden we take a stage to Reno, then another one over to Auburn and another one to Placerville. Then it's a day's trip to Sonora.
3 Clay could save us an awful lot of time.	He certainly could. About a month.
4 What are you waiting for? Do something.

1 You said somebody was comin' back -- who's comin' back?	Stop it --

1 Is that your kind of reading, Steve?	I can't read, Ma'am. I just look at the pictures.

1 -- and even if I do learn to read, what use'll it be? I'm goin' to live on a ranch!	There's plenty of use for reading -- you'll see.

1 You stretch out. I'll fix something to eat.	Thanks, Steve.

1 Oh, remember that time I got my training bra and you --	Never happened!

1 This house was built in 1898 by a man named Archibald Keaton as a gift to his wife, Cora.	Yes, I feel their spirits. Cora... Keaton... I am here to communicate...
2 No, they sold the house in 1920 to a millionaire, Uriah Bloodworth.	Yes, of course, Uriah. I feel his evil presence.
3 No, he lost the house after the stock market crash.	But he could still be haunting the house. He's angry that he had to leave.
4 He's not dead, you idiot. He lives in Florida. Now, shut up and let me finish.

1 Hi Buddy.	Open chest!!!

1 We should act out our inner most fantasies.	Great!!!
2 Like, I've always wanted to walk on the moon.	Huh?

1 Hey, look out, a bee!	Oh, Buddy, I've never had someone be so protective of me!
2 That's what your man is supposed to do.

1 Come in somebody. Can you hear me?	This is Ray. What's up? Where are you?
2 The ghost is close. He almost got us. Buddy is hurt.	What's your location? I repeat, what's your location?
3 Right behind you.

1 Stop! --	Made you say it!

1 I'm sorry.	Father, I don't understand. Tell me what happened?
2 Soon, but first I must bless this house.

1 Professor, is this the same house that a young girl was possessed by a demon or something?	Yes, it was reported, but never substantiated.

1 I don't like this, this...	Why don't you shut up, Professor? Just relax.

1 Are those cameras all throughout the house?	Yes, I thought that it would be best.
2 Even in the bathroom?

1 Hello Dwight.	Hi.

1 You never could feel your legs.	What do you know about it?!... Listen, the ghost is too powerful. The only chance we have is to use this machine.  I need you to go get the others and meet us upstairs.

1 Oh shit, you gonna take that?	What?
2 What she said about your mother?

1 Yo' Tommy, what up, man?	I'm totally freakin' dude. I keep having these nightmares, then I wake up screaming with these awful back spasms. I can't take it anymore, man.
2 Aww, man. You just need to chill out. Come on, there's this party tonight it's gonna be fun. Lot's of alcohol and honeys.	Alright, but I ain't drinking. and you're gonna have to look after me.
3 Don't worry, I got your back.

1 I wouldn't give ya a nickel.	Carl can't believe how much I make at swap meets.

1 Well, your mother's going to PTA today.  We'll see what your teacher has to say. 	Aw, Mom! I hate Mr. Stubbins!

1 Bye, Birdie.  Chip, honey... I know it's hard being a teenager but I understand... I'm your mother and I love you.	Oh Mom...
2 Can we watch that scene again? You know, where he rips out her heart?  PLEEEASE?

1 What is it, officers? My patient is waiting.	Dr. Sutphin is your wife a big reader?
2 Bird books mostly...

1 Sorry, son.  This is a matter for adults.	Officers, I've never said the P-word out loud, much less written it down!
2 No woman would!	Look officers! Life doesn't have to be ugly.  See the little birdie? Listen to his call.  Peter Pan! Peter Pan! Peter Pan!

1 Beverly! Not the Sterners!	It's a shame. But they should brush their teeth, honey.

1 FUCK YOU TOO, YOU ROTTEN WHORE!!	I beg your pardon?
2 Who is this?	Mrs. Wilson from the telephone company. I understand you're having problems with obscene calls.
3 Yes, I am... I'm sorry Mrs. Wilson... It's driving me crazy... I've changed my number twice already... Please help me!

1 Did you see her?! She just said "Fuck you" to me!	Let the record show I'm just standing here.
2 FUCK YOU TOO, YOU WHORE!

1 It's him!	No, honey, it's the police.  Hello, officers.

1 That was your People magazine with the letters cut out, wasn't it?	Yes, but I lent it...
2 And those were your scissors found sticking out of Mrs. Sterner's stomach, weren't they?	Yes... but... I didn't...
3 Mrs. Ackerman, do you recycle?	No...  I don't have room in my kitchen...

1 What is it, Betty?	We have mice! I mean it, Ralph! I saw one!

1 The acceptance of a secret is an obligation and in this case my dear, the obligation carried with it the necessity of dying if one betrayed that secret. You understand that don't you?	Yes, I understand.
2 Then, you also understand that you must die.	No.

1 I haven't got that much in cash.	How much have you got?
2 About forty-five dollars.	For the time being, I imagine that must do.

1 Some of us, Frances, must believe without understanding.	Yes.

1  What have you done about Irving August?	Oh, I'm making investigations.
2 You've never believed a word I told you about Mr. August.	Look, Mary, now that I know you better, I think I can be more frank with you. I don't believe you. I still can't understand the reason for such a wild tale. It's like some of Jacqueline's stories.
3 Greg, it isn't a wild tale. It's true. If there were only some way --	There is a very simple way. Got a telephone book?

1 I'm going to find your sister.	I don't think that's a good subject for jokes, Mr. Hoag.
2 But I'm not joking.	Don't be ridiculous. For months I've had the best private detective in New York looking for Miss Gibson.
3 But I'm better than a detective. I have an understanding of people - and a love of them -- an understanding of the city - -	You don't even know Jacqueline Gibson.
4 But I understand her. That may be more important.	It may make very fine poetry, Mr. Hoag, but it doesn't make good sense.

1 I'm tired of being afraid - of waiting.	Why wait?
2 I'm not going to wait. I'm going out -- laugh, dance --do all the things I used to do.	And then?
3 I don't know.	You will die.

1 I want you to see my room. I want you to see all of it.	But it's a small room, Jason.
2 It's grown big with time -- I've lived here with the Romari's for ten years -- the room's become part of me. I want you to see it  to know me better.

1 Jason, my pet 	Bella Romari If I were not seated, I would embrace you in three movements like a sonata.  Ah, my wonderful one. Fly with me tonight. We will take your coffee machine and live with the gypsies.

1 Following me to find Jacqueline?	Uhhuh.
2 Well, it won't work. Love and understanding won't make a good detective out of a recalcitrant poet.	Actually I want to ask two favors of you -- one as a poet  one as a detective.
3 It sounds strange, and I'm going to be very wary.

1 What?	They may have found her.  Mrs. Cortez - this morning I told her Jacqueline was no longer under my care.

1 Is it about Jacqueline?	No. She's no longer under my care.

1 I can almost feel your doubt about what I'm saying, Mary.	I can't give up looking for her, Mrs. Redi, no matter what you're hinting at.
2 I have no intention whatsoever of hinting. Your sister, Mary, is a murderess. She killed Irving August -- stabbed him out of fright when he discovered where she was hiding.	I don't believe it.
3 I had to help get rid of the body. You saw it on the subway. And I warn you, Mary -- go back -- you don't know what you're doing, or what dreadful things you might bring about by looking for your sister. You go back to school - - go back and forget Jacqueline.

1 Miss Gibson, I'm tired of resting.	Sh-h-h Nancy. The other children.

1 You have only to stretch out your hand, take up the glass and drink a little.	It won't hurt.

1 This food is excellent.	Thank you.

1 So what about kids?	Kids? What about them?
2 Do you want them?	Yeah, actually, I do. But John doesn't. At least not right now.
3 Why is that?	I don't know, he just said he wants to wait. I quit asking.

1 What... what are these interviews about?	The... interviews are about sex, Ann.
2 About sex?	Yes.
3 What about sex?	Everything about sex.
4 Like what?	Like what they've done, what they do, what they don't do, what they want to do but are afraid to ask for, what they won't do even if asked. Anything I can think of.
5 You just ask them questions?	Yes.
6 And they just answer them?	Mostly. Sometimes they do things.
7 To you?	No, not to me, for me, for the camera.
8 I don't... why... why do you do this?	I'm sorry this came up.
9 This is just... so...	Maybe you want to go.
10 Yes, I do.

1 Is he going to see this?	Absolutely not.

1 If you were in love with me, would you?	I'm not in love with you.
2 But if you were?	I... I can't answer that precisely.
3 But I feel like maybe I could be really comfortable with you.	That's very flattering.
4 So why won't you make love with me? Why wouldn't you, I mean?	Ann. Are you asking me hypothetically, or are you asking me for real, right now?
5 I'm asking for real. I want you to turn that camera off and make love with me. Will you?

1 Oh, we get along okay. She's just very... she's an extrovert. I think she's loud. She probably wouldn't agree. Definitely wouldn't agree.	Are you going to see Elizabeth while you're here?

1 Goddammit, goddammit!! That son of a bitch!!  Well, at least I know you didn't fuck him.	No, but I wanted to. I really wanted to, partially just to piss you off.

1 When did you begin having this feeling?	About a week ago. I don't know what brought it on, I just started feeling like I didn't want him to touch me.
2 Prior to this feeling, were you comfortable having physical contact with him?	Oh, yeah.  But see, I've never really been into sex that much, I mean, I like it and everything, it just does't freak me out, I wouldn't miss it, you know? But anyway, lately we haven't been doing anything at all. Like I said, it's not that I miss it, but I'm curious the way things kind of slacked off all of a sudden.

1 Besides, even if I decided to fuck his brains out, what business is that of yours?	Do you have to say that?
2 What?	You know what. You say it just to irritate me.
3 I say it because it's descriptive.	Well, he doesn't strike me as the kind of person that would go in for that sort of thing, anyway.
4 Ann, you always underestimate me.	Well, I wonder why.
5 I think you're afraid to put the two of us in the same room together. I think you're afraid he'll be undeniably drawn to me.	Oh, for God's sake. Really, Cynthia, really, I don't think he's your type.
6 "My type"? What is this bullshit? How would you know what "my type" is?	I have a pretty good idea.
7 Ann, you don't have a clue. Look, I don't even know why we're discussing this, I'll just call him myself.	He doesn't have a phone.
8 Well, I'll call him when he does.	But he won't.
9 What are you talking about?	He's not getting a phone, he doesn't like talking on the phone.
10 Oh, please. Okay, so give me the Zen master's address, I'll think of a reason to stop by.	Let me talk to him first.
11 Why? Just give me the address, you won't even have to be involved.	I don't feel right just giving you the address so that you can go over there and...
12 And what?	And... do whatever it is you do.

1 Thank you.	Well. I can't stay.

1 I am now recording. Tell me your name.	Cynthia Patrice Bishop.
2 Describe for me your first sexual experience.	My first sexual experience or the first time I had intercourse?
3 Your first sexual experience.	I was... eight years old. Michael Green, who was also eight, asked if he could watch me take a pee. I said he could if I could watch him take one, too. He said okay, and then we went into the woods behind our house. I got this feeling he was chickening out because he kept saying, "Ladies first!" So I pulled down my underpants and urinated, and he ran away before I even finished.
4 Was it ever a topic of conversation between the two of you afterward?	No. He kind of avoided me for the rest of the summer, and then his family moved away. To Cleveland, actually.
5 How unfortunate. So when did you finally get to see a penis?	When I was fourteen.
6 Live, or in a photograph or film of some sort?	Very much live.
7 What did you think? Did it look like you expected?	Not really. I didn't picture it with veins or ridges or anything, I thought it would be smooth, like a test tube.
8 Were you disappointed?	No. If anything, after I looked at it awhile, it got more interesting. It had character, you know?
9 What about when you touched it? What did you expect it to feel like, and then what did it really feel like?	It was warmer than I thought it would be, and the skin was softer than it looked. It's weird. Thinking about it now, the organ itself seemed like a separate thing, a separate entity to me. I mean, after he pulled it out and I could look at it and touch it, I completely forgot that there was a guy attached to it. I remember literally being startled when the guy spoke to me.
10 What did he say?	He said that my hand felt good.
11 Then what happened?	Then I started moving my hand, and then he stopped talking.

1 I wish I could tell everybody that Ann's a lousy lay. Beautiful, popular, Ann Bishop Millaney.	Could be risky.
2 Well, maybe I could just start a rumor, then.	No, I mean doing it at my house.
3 Afraid of getting caught?	Maybe.
4 You should be. Can I meet this friend of yours?	Cynthia, I don't think you want to, I mean, you should see the way he dresses. I really think he's in a bad way.
5 I'm intrigued.	You're intrigued?
6 Sure. Maybe he's the man I'm looking for. Then I won't have to fuck worried husbands all the time.

1 Come on, John. You should be happy, we've gone this far without Ann finding out, I'm making it real easy on you. Just walk out of here and I'll see you at your house for a family dinner sometime.	Did he put you up to this?
2 Who?	Graham.
3 No, he didn't put me up to this. Jesus, I don't need people to tell me what I should do. I've just been thinking about things, that's all.	I can't believe I let him stay in my house. Right under my nose. That deviant fucker was right under my nose and I didn't see him.
4 If he had been under your prick you'd have spotted him for sure.	God, you... you're mean.
5 I know. Will you please leave now?	Maybe I don't want to leave. Maybe I want to talk.
6 John, we have nothing to talk about.	I knew it, I knew it. Things are getting complicated.
7 No, John, things are getting real simple.

1 Your keys, asshole!! Your two fucking keys!! Give them to me!!	I'm not going to give you my keys.

1 Jesus!	Let's get outta here before somebody hears us!

1 Anything wrong?	No. I don't think so.
2 Well? Supper at my place?	OK. But late.
3 Great! Go back to your files. Bye.

1 Where is this thing that attacked your wife?	I hit it. I hit it with my cane. Then I carry it on the cane and I throw it down to the incinerator, down to the garbage.

1 Rog, I gotta talk serious to you. Really. Listen. Ya listening? OK. I want you to come into this with me. To tell the honest-to-God truth, I'm lonely.  All Hobbes ever did was run around getting money and phone me in the middle of the night. He wanted you in anyway. That's why we were gonna get together, the three of us. We would have enough to keep us going for at least five years, even with inflation.	Rollo, you know me. Once a GP, always a GP.
2 You want to help sick people for the rest of your life? God forbid I should talk you out of it.	You oughta be careful yourself. Might end up cutting your throat.
3 It was women did it to Hobbes. Couldn't handle them. That girl, that Annabelle -- talk about crazy projects.	Who was she?
4 Aw, he met her when he was lecturing at some private girls' school. They caught him examining her little tits for breast cancer in the faculty lounge. She was twelve. Don't ask. It was craziness, believe me.  They used to come here sometimes.  Don't ask.

1 You bet, Bert.	Good!  I'm gonna be there.

1 I know, I know, it's just...	Looks like 'Rest Home' for this marriage.

1 In my time they used to call me the Merlin of Berlin.	They probably meant Irving and wanted you to swing.

1 Conspiracy?  That sounds a little farfetched.	It's happened before.  Remember Lieutenant Orpheus?  He disappeared into that Underworld series and never came back.
2 Sounds like my husband.  He never came back either.  At least not after Flavors gave him a commercial break.	Ah yes.  Farley Flavors.  You know, I find it...

1 Oh.  Ah, I'm not calling at an inconvenient moment am I?	Not at all.  You have your life.  And I have mine.
2 Yeah, well.  Here, Betty.  I just came to give you this.

1 YOU'LL FIND A RAMBLING ROSE AND A PICKET FENCE	TENDERNESS AND INNOCENCE IN DENTON`

1 Brad!  Oh, Brad.	He's a lame dog, remember?  But even he wouldn't want to see you like this.

1 Just one or two details.  Does he have any living relatives? Blood relatives?	No...couldn't I do this later?

1 Ah.  Mr. And Mrs. Majors.  How wonderful to see you.  I am Dr. Cosmo McKinley and this is my sister, and colleague, Nation McKinley.	We understand you've been going through a rather trying time.

1 THAT MINIMAL	CRIMINAL

1 You don't think I fuck you, bitch? I'll fuck you.	I'm a bad girl. I'm a bad girl.

1 Are you there? Miles?	Yeah, I'm here.
2 I'm sorry, Miles. We did all we could. You've been a real trooper.  Tell him I'll call back.	So I guess that's it.
3 You're a wonderful writer, Miles. Don't be discouraged.

1 She was good for you.  And so beautiful and intelligent. You knew her, right?	Oh, yeah. Real well. Still do.
2 I'm worried about you, Miles. Do you need some money?

1 Hiya.	Hi. Well, nice to see you guys here. Bye, Miles.

1 Did you read the latest draft, by the way?	Oh, yeah. Yeah.
2 And?	I liked it a lot. A lot of improvements. It just seemed overall, I don't know, tighter, more... congealed or something.
3 How about the new ending? Did you like that?	Oh yeah. Much better.
4 There is no new ending. Page 750 on is exactly the same.	Well, then I guess it must have felt new because everything leading up to it was so different.

1 So what'd you guys finally decide on for the menu?	I told you. Filet and salmon.
2 Yeah, but how are they making the salmon? Poached with a yogurt-dill sauce? Teriyaki? Curry?	I don't know. Salmon. Don't you always have white wine with fish?
3 Oh, Jesus. Look, at some point we have to find out because it's going to make a big difference.	Let me call Christine.
4 Doesn't have to be now. Let's go taste.	I owe her a call anyway.

1 Hey Jack, hurry up!	Just a minute!

1 So what're we going to have? Pigs in a blanket? The "rancher's special breakfast"? Or maybe just some grease and fat with a side of lard?	So what's the plan today?
2 We head north, begin the grape tour up there, make our way south so the more we drink the closer we get to the motel.

1 So what should I wear?	I don't know. Casual but nice. They think you're a writer.

1 Oh, boy.	She's been leaving messages here too.
2 Yeah. Okay.

1 Call me on my cell if you go out.	Yeah.

1 Just don't give up on Maya. Cool smart chicks like that --they like persistence.	I don't want to talk about it.
2 All I know is she's beautiful. Lots of soul. Perfect for you. I'm not going to feel good about this trip until you guys hook up. Don't you just want to feel that cozy little box grip down on your Johnson?

1 How about this one? We didn't hit this one.	Yeah, it's Frass Canyon. It's a joke.
2 You ever actually been in there, Miles?	I don't have to.
3 I say we check it out. You never know.

1 Fucking chick's married.	What?
2 Her husband works a night shift or something, and he comes home, and I'm on the floor with my cock in his wife's ass.	Jesus, Jack. Jesus. And you walked all the way back from Solvang?
3 Ran. Twisted my ankle too.	That's five clicks, Jackson.
4 Fucking-a it's five clicks! At one point I had to cut through an ostrich farm. Fuckers are mean.

1 What the fuck!	You said it looked like a car accident.
2 What the fuck!	I'll pay for it.

1 Well, good to see you, Miles. Jack.	See you.

1 Is this Stephanie's kid? Sure is cute.	Yeah, Siena's a sweetie.
2 Is she sleeping or...?	She's with her grandmother. She's with Steph's mom. She spends a lot of time over there. Steph's... well, she's Stephanie.

1 No, we've got to get back Friday for the rehearsal dinner.	What rehearsal dinner?

1 Hello?	Miles, don't call me when you're drunk.
2 I just wanted you to know I've decided not to go to the wedding, so in case you were dreading some uncomfortable, you know, run-in or something, well, worry no more. You won't see me there. My wedding gift to you and what's- his-name. What is his name?	Ken.
3 Ken.	Miles, I don't care if you come to the wedding or not.
4 Well, I'm not coming, Barbie. So you guys have fun.	I'm going to hang up now, Miles.
5 You see, Vicki, I just heard about this today, you getting married that is, and I was kind of taken aback. Kind of hard to believe.

1 What's everyone ordering? Then we can sort out the wine.	Exactement!

1 It was a surprise, Mom.	And I could have already put clean sheets on the other bed and the fold- out. You are staying. Wendy, Ron and the twins are picking us up at 11:30 to go to brunch at the Sheraton. They do a magnificent job there. Wendy is so excited you're coming.

1 See this is why we're not watching those news reports. People get obsessed.  I'm letting go now.	No dad!

1 I was just taking a walk before dinner.	You love walks.

1 It was very dark.	Yes it was.

1 For the kids protection. All they were doing was watching TV from five a.m. I felt like they were getting obsessed like you said. They should be playing furry, furry rabbit or tea party or something right?	What's furry, furry rabbit?
2 That's a game isn't it?  Anyway...  There's been some interesting developments.	What time is it?
3 Eleven a.m. They're gone.

1 We won't be able to get out of there.	I'm sorry I hurt your arm.

1 That's good enough for me.	Me too.

1 It says they're probably very small -- like my height -- because, as their brains developed, there was no use for physical development. It says they're probably vegetarians, because they would have realized the benefits of such a diet.	Who wrote this book?

1 They'll read our minds!	You're scaring your sister.

1 Is anything missing?	No.

1 Some guy had a sign that said it was the end of the world.  Nothing really bad is going to happen, is it Uncle Merrill?	Don't worry.

1 Jake, I'm going to ask you once -- was it self-defense?	Honest to God, Emmett, he would've killed me.

1 ...Gotta go...	Sure.

1 The Parkers seem like nice folks.	They've been kind to me.
2 Paden sends his best.	I guess I put a good scare into him.

1 I'm just meeting a guy here and moving on. So far I haven't been able to find him.	In my town, when you're looking for someone, you ask me.
2 All right. I'm looking for a young fella, full of juice. About my size, wears a fancy two-gun rig.

1 Doesn't look quite fair.	Which way do you mean?

1 You might make a farmer yet.	I've got a job.

1 You mean you ain't coming with Emmett and me?	I can't say I'm convinced you're going anywhere.
2 Sure we are. We're leaving at dawn.	I've got no reason to run. It was a fair fight and there were plenty of witnesses.
3 Yeah, that's what happened with me too.	The other guy drew first.
4 Right!

1 There are three strangers in this room, traveller, and these gents you are accusing aren't them.  Are these your friends?	I wanted a drink and a bed. I guess I came to the wrong place.
2 Came to the wrong town. I don't tolerate this kind of thing. It's hard on the peace, and it's hard on the furniture. Now, knowing a bit about Carter here, I'm going to let you go without paying for the damages. But go you will, and I mean now.	Is there a place in town that takes... my kind?
3 You misunderstand. I want you out of town. In fact, I want you all the way out of my jurisdiction.	That ain't right.
4 I decide what's right in this jurisdiction. Now move.

1 This is it, gents. My ma told me to head south past that rock.	Good luck, Mal.

1 You got a place to stay?	I just got to town.
2 Stella, we still got an extra room out back, don't we?

1 You work here?	I run the place. What can I get you?

1 What is it that I can't figure?	What do you mean?
2 Cobb's got something on you, and it must be pretty good.

1 Can you tell us why you were disposing of the body of a woman who didn't exist?	It wasn't her body.  It was her body of work.
2 Why don't you just come clean, Viktor?  Tell the truth.  You'll feel better afterwards.	I am telling the truth.
3 We all know what happened.  In a fit of jealous rage you killed Simone and dumped her body off a boat she bought for you.	No!!  I can prove it to you.  I'll take you to her.

1 I'm not taking away your daughter, just your deal.  You and I both know, after the divorce I kept you on for old time's sake, so you could still hold your head up in front of Lainey.  I called what's his name at Warner's.  He said he'd take a meeting -- in July.  I've fought for you Viktor...  You want to talk severance?	You can have everything -- office, car, assistants -- all I want is the picture.
2 The picture's dead.	So there's no problem -- I can have the rights, the negative too?
3 They're yours.  But how are you going to finish it?  Without a star there's no movie.	I don't need a star.  All I need is an actor -- I'll reshoot the part, cut out Nicola and replace her with a real actor.  A real leading lady.
4 Even if you find her, you know the problem with unknowns, Viktor.  If they're good, they get known.  And then you're back to sorting their candy... and worse.  I'm sorry, Viktor.

1 Maybe you're right.  Twelve years after your daughter's born you decide to become a father.	Better late than never.
2 I should fire you more often.  The film's looking wonderful.	You really think so?
3 Yes.  To be honest I never quite saw this film before -- maybe it's the way Simone is playing it -- but what it's saying about the illusion of permanence in everyday life, how that's the only way we can love -- I think it's really going to mean something.	Thank you.  I'll tell Simone you liked it.
4 I'd love to tell her myself.  When are you going to let me meet her?	Soon.  Soon.
5 Everyone I know has met her, Viktor.	Everyone you know is lying.
6 That's true.

1 My two favorite girls.	Lainey and I just wanted to congratulate...

1 Don't look so glum, Viktor.  It's not a death sentence.	No... it's life.

1 You understand you'll have to come back to my place to keep them off the, er...  ... scent.	Of course.
2 You look so, so...	... so much like her?
3 Yes, of course, but very beautiful in your own right.	I do find myself physically attracted to you, Mr. Taransky.

1 Viktor, I'm so happy for us!	Hello, Hal.
2 The film.  The chemistry.  No reflections on Nicola but Simone and I -- we were just so right together.	You never were together, Hal.
3 And still the connection was undeniable.  I haven't read "Eternity Forever" but I know it's brilliant.  And I know I would be perfect for Clive.	Clyde.
4 Yes, perfect.  As a matter of fact, I ran into Simone on the lot the other day.	Really?  She didn't mention it.
5 I'm sure she's meeting with a lot of people right now.  She is just as you described her, Viktor... indescribable.  I strongly sensed she thought I was right for it.

1 You already do.  But my actor won't get old, fat, lazy or drunk -- won't throw tantrums, demand a body double, script changes or a bigger trailer.  The Disney Corporation has been using artificial actors for years.	That's the point, Hank.  No matter how good they are, they're still Mickey Mouse.  Everyone's tried. Everyone's failed.  It can't be done.
2 It can -- with my new computer code, you and me, we can do it together.	I don't know anything about computers.
3 That's why you're so perfect.  You have something I don't have.	What's that?
4 An eye -- for performance.  You know the truth when you see it.  I know.  I've seen your movies.  I love your movies.	You do?
5 "Straw God" changed my life.	You saw that?
6 I've seen every frame of your work. You're the only filmmaker in Hollywood with the artistic integrity to realize my vision. You and me, art and science... we are the perfect marriage.	Listen, Hank, it's been a rough day.  I'll call you about his next week.
7 I won't be here next week.  The tumor's inoperable.  I'll be dead.	I'm already dead.

1 Okay, Dad.	If anyone asks about Simone --
2 -- I know, I don't know anything.	Exactly.  Don't you wonder where I'm really hiding Simone?
3 I'm sure you'd tell me if you thought it was important.

1 About you and mom?	Me and Simone.  What I did.
2 Your mistake wasn't making something fake, daddy.  We're fine with fake -- as long as you don't lie about it.

1 Alright, Sayer, you've got a deal.	Er,... good.

1 Mr. Sayer...	What do you want -- ?
2 Mr. Sayer, did we pay the million bucks yet?	-- Cashier's check went out to our anonymous tipster this morning -- worth every penny too.  Who says there's no place for checkbook journalism?  We'll be running stills of this for months, then release the whole tape -- we'll get our money back -- maybe show it on an exclusive pay-per-view event. Do you realize what we have here? We have the only independent footage of Simone in existence.
3 We used to.

1 Hi.	Perfect.  God, I'm so relaxed around you.

1 Speaking of which -- this is the project I'd like you to do next.	Not, "Eternity Forever"?  The legendary unproduced script that was too good ever to get made?  I'd kill for that part.
2 I was hoping you'd say that.

1 On my way to the flea market in Amish country. Thought maybe you want to come. Show me how to buy at these things.	I trust you... Besides, I don't know if I'm up for the Amish today. You can't curse or spit or anything around them.

1 And Cole, next time I won't be late for you.	Next time I won't be scared of you.

1 Mr. Marschal gets real lonely.	What about Mrs. Marschal?
2 She died a long time ago.

1 Dead people, like in graves and coffins?	No, walking around, like regular people... They can't see each other. Some of them don't know they're dead.
2 They don't know they're dead?

1 Don't cry.	It means I wasn't what everyone thought I was...  I was a fake.
2 You weren't a paper champion.	Someone else can help you. Someone else can make you happy.

1 Don't go home, okay?	I definitely won't.

1 You know that accident up there?	Yeah.
2 Someone got hurt.	They did?
3 A lady. She died.	Oh my God.

1 Yes, Cole?	They used to hang people here.

1 ...He doesn't get invited places.	It's our pleasure.
2 The last time was a Chuck E. Cheese party a year ago. He hid in one of those purple plastic tunnels and didn't come out.	Chuck E. who?
3 Cheese. It's a kid's place.

1 Okay, Farm Boy. Joke's over. You've been playin' me from jump street. Where's my Nikes?	Nikes? What-the-hail you talkin' about?

1 Suzie???	The hell with this.  I'm coming back up!!!

1 You know, one day I'm going to have to shut down that still of yours, Jeremiah.	Well, why don't you hold these as evidence in the meantime.

1 The ancient Aztecs knew how powerful this stuff was.	Cowshit? Are you sure the Aztecs even had cows?

1 We've got to call someone -- get the sheriff--	The Sheriff?! We don't need the sheriff!!! We need to get the hell out of here!

1 You like it? Irrigation system. Your grandaddy built it himself. Saved the land from dying.	That's a good idea. Maybe we should have a little "talk" about grandaddy Jethro.
2 Sure. What do you want to know.	People say he was a murderer.
3 That's your grandfather you're talking about!  I... know what people say. Heard it... all my life.

1 Hey. Could you be a little more insensitive? We're on our way to a funeral for Crissake.	Yeah. Our own. I don't see why we got to go along for the ride.

1 Yeah. That's just the problem.	Tell me you checked the bus before we left, Carl.

1 We're almost ready. What the hell are you doing out here?	I... heard something... came in here last night. Must have gone to sleep.

1 The trap door. That's how he escaped the fire...	You've been... hiding him all these years. Helping him... irrigate the land. With blood...

1 Carl.	CARL??? Carl did this?!!
2 Last night... he tried to get it on with me.

1 What you up to?	Just checking out the lights.

1 Was always curious why you... married Grant in the first place... Just never seemed outta love.	I know what people say, Bill. I... Remember, back in high school I worked at my father's gas station?

1 He's gotta be in the forest. All three ranches run alongside it.	Think we should get up a search party, head in there?

1 Looks like a chipmunk.	Your momma wasn't too proud when you came out neither, Wally.

1 Where's the old half--Mexican?	Took the kids to his Mom's for the weekend.

1 I never danced in a towel before.	Wearing white, just like on our... wedding day. I remember it.

1 He took him over. His body. His -- his brain, everything what he knew. He's only been dumb stuff before amoeba--things, and rhino--things. He liked being human. Didn't want to change.	And you said the worms are part of him. They're all linked, like one creature?
2 When one sees you they all see you.	An animal that doesn't procreate. It spreads, grows. A living disease.

1 I can't believe there's two thousand people here to watch a bunch of guys back up their trucks.	America's bored.  Now, what do you want?
2 You to forget this dumbass Roadeo and take on a real challenge.

1 Well?...	Whaddya want to know? My sign?
2 No. I want to know what you think about besides ditching Smokey?	Having fun.
3 Is this fun?	Driving?
4 Driving, talking to me...	They're both a challenge.
5 You have a great profile.	Yeah, I do. Especially from that angle.

1 Your honeymoon would've never been this exciting.	I don't know. We were planning on seeing the Astrodome.

1 -- You know, I used to be a high fashion model. Tried it for six months and almost freaked. Makeup, silly clothes, a little man saying 'darling' every two seconds...	Yeah, it's tough when your cheek- bones are your main asset.
2 Uh-oh.

1 They should arrest people for obeying the speed limit.	Bandit II?

1 See ya, Bandit.	See ya, Kate.

1 Believe me, man; Fred'll be no problem.	Yeah, I can tell he's gonna be a major asset.

1 You know how to drive one of these things?	Can a pig whistle?

1 Bandit?	Yeah, guy?
2 Pick up a burger for Fred. He's going crazy. 

1 -- How we doing?	It's gonna be close. Real close.

1 Breaker, Breaker. This is Bandit I, coming up on a portable gas station. Do you copy?	Bandit, this is Mister B, and I'm gearjamming this rolling refinery. You got another Smokey on the rubber?
2 What else?  Can you give me cover, Mister B?

1 Yeah, Bandit II, Que pasa?	That's a Texas bubble gum machine on your back porch.
2 What's he...

1 It's gotta be tough keeping an eye on everything.	And everybody, all the time. Yeah, it's a chore.

1 But the Bureau knew Sparazza killed Heller. Why not go after him, guns blazing' for that one?	Heller was buried in agency lore, anytime an operative failed or was perceived to have failed, Hoover blackballed their memory. Look at Ness.
2 Yeah, but the Untouchables took down Capone. Heller got shot and killed. The bad guys beat him. Worse, Sparazza walked.

1 This man wearing the jacket identified himself as an Federal agent?	Uh, yeah.
2 You're sure?	Yeah, he had the badge and everything. It said "FBI" on it.
3 And when you saw him later, he was wearing one of your security jackets --	Yeah.
4 And that didn't seem odd to you?

1 I'm here, where's the car?	I sent Hugo, he should be there!

1 I said that we were returning his call and you were real concerned, because he sounded real concerned.	Look at that, we didn't have to fill up the whole blackboard after all. Now, do you know anything about that?

1 FUCK YOU!	GET IN HERE GODDAMMIT!

1 It's the last place they'd look.	Israel's legal representation, the firm of Culpepper, Brody and Reed, which is currently the subject of a joint SEC and Treasury Department probe, were left holding the bag after he skipped bail. Over three- quarters of a million dollars on a bond that's set to expire in less than a day. Rupert Reed, one of the firm's partners, has learned of Israel's whereabouts and dispatched a local bondsman by the name of Jack Dupree to pick him up and return him to Las Vegas... that can't happen.  We have a Gulf Stream standing by at Reagan International to transport you two to Lake Tahoe.  It's very simple gentlemen. Valacchi, Fratiano, Gravano -- no former witness against the mob has been as crucial or has brought more to bear on the potential dissolution of The La Cosa Nostra, than Buddy Israel.

1 You realize that Sparraza has had thirty-six major medical procedures performed on him since 1953? Elective plastic surgery, every single one --	It wasn't elective. It was undertaken to save his life. And it wasn't cosmetic, it was reconstructive... Look at the date of the first procedure.
2 ...Yeah, fifty-three.	The same year that Sparazza murdered Agent Freeman Heller...

1 Buzzy... Buzz...?	Yeah... Sid?
2 Right, you got clicks, anything?	Nah, nuthin' on my end --

1 You got the fifty up? Bitch y'tryin' t'take down a jumbo jet? Blown the moon out the sky? T'fuck you wanna get that grimy?	The try t'wild out on my boo and it's on and crackin'! I'm layin' niggas out.
2 Damn, this kevlar ridin' up on me, I wish they made this more sheer.

1 Bulllllshit...	Naw baby, they heard about that Triad hit, the work ya'll put in and they recognize the skills. And this ain't no tryout, tap-dance "show us your shit" thing neither -- if ya'll want this then I'mma go git it for 'ya.

1 Meaning Man can do whatever the fuck it wants?	Yes.
2 That's fantastic.	Why did you agree to come here?

1 Tell me.  I won't think you're insane.	Oh, that's a relief.

1 They come when you sleep.	That's right.  And we all have to sleep, eventually.

1 Don't.	Why?
2 I don't know.  I can't be alone.	I'll be right back.

1 But what if Solaris is what there was before The Big Bang?	As I said, it is beyond our comprehension.
2 As I said, then it's God, right?

1 I like that too.	How could she not be real?  I can smell her, taste her.  She does exactly what she did... it's not possible.
2 You know, I've decided: I'm just gonna believe what you believe about this whole Solaris thing, it'll make life so much easier; the little wife agreeing with her big, strong husband. You must get such a headache thinking about those Great Big Problems all day.

1 Can you sleep?	I don't think do.  It's not sleep; it's something else.  It's all around me.
2 Those are dreams.

1 Listen: I don't care about anything but the fact that you are here.  You are her, you are Rheya.	I'm disgusting.
2 No.	You're lying.  I'm not human.
3 Rheya, I am not going back.  I'm staying here with you.	Then you'll die.
4 I want every second I can get with you.

1 We thought you'd be alone.  We want to talk about...	We want to talk freely.

1 I've never seen anyone killed before.	It's okay... I've never been a detective before either...

1 You can touch me, I won't bite.	Not too sure about that.

1 That's the dumbest walk I ever saw!	No, no seriously!  There's a study done on this, you walk this way, the muggers are gonna single you out.
2 And die laughing, because you're walking so stupid!	Hey.  This is my business.  Do I tell you your business.
3 Okay.  Let's just see if a mugger gets me.

1 Yeah.	They called here after you left...
2 She's okay.  Everything's okay...

1 They guys treatin' you all right?	Yeah.
2 I've been doing a lot of thinking.	I know.

1 I'll miss you, Mike.	Listen, I'll... see you again.

1 Hey, can we go to McDonald's?	Absolutely.

1 Hey.  The neighbors.	Let 'em eat their hearts out.

1 I'm sorry.  I know I heard noises... the detective's wife...	I want you and Tommy to stay with my mother.

1 He doesn't want to sleep here.  Neither do I.  It's not my house anymore.	Me neither.

1 No One-Seventeen, they'll fuck it up!  He told me not to tell anybody, to bring Claire and come alone!  He won't wait, he knows I'm two minutes away!  Koontz, please!	I can't do it, you know that... He's not gonna allow it anyway, Mike.  No way is he gonna let anybody walk out of that house alive, who can finger him.

1 You're here 'til what time?	I'm relieved at 4:00 A.M.

1 Nice threads Dad.	Yeah, I think so.

1 Here you go, Pete.	Uh, Uncle Ben, I--
2 What, want a glass?	No. No, that's okay.

1 Flash, get lost.	Come on, laughter's the best medicine!

1 Now tell me you love me.	Lemme down, bugface!
2 That's not even close.

1 Oh, that?  It'll come unstuck in a half-hour or so. Your mouth needs the rest.  Bye.	Hmf-hrr?

1 I hate the Platonic idea of you.	I hate people with alliterative names.
2 I hate--	I hate your relatives, I hate your coffee, I hate your shoes.

1 Don't misquote Othello at me. Besides, you'd have to care about somebody to strangle them.	What's your problem?
2 I've got no problems.

1 Hold it.  Can we stop being clever, just for a moment?	Why?

1 Aunt May, you're trespassing.	Your records are older than you are.  Have you never heard of new wave?

1 Poison emergency.	Hi.  I've got sort of a hypothetical question.  Do you suppose the bite of a radioactive spider would transmit that spider's proportional strength and agility?
2 Is this some sort of Zen thing?	I mean, I suddenly have immense physical power, and the ability to crawl up walls--
3 Do ya? Lemme give you the number for Bellevue.  That's 561-5151--	Yeah, a psychiatric hospital. Listen, I'm serious--

1 A bit melodramatic but if you could prove it that would tie in your unified field theory, the Big Bang, Kaluza-Klein--	Ach, theories!  This was first hand, experiential knowledge, the essence of the universe.

1 This photo you took of "Spider-Man" -	Luck.  The right place at the right time.
2 Really.  I'd like to speak with him.	I don't think I'll be running into him.
3 You never know.  Go get some sleep.	I'll try. Thanks.

1 I listened to him talk of eternal truth and thought of the Bhagavad Gita, the Indian holy book-- "I am become Shiva, Death-- the destroyer of worlds."  Octavius was...	Bonkers.
2 Loonytunes.  And yet...	Just drop me off here.

1 We made a deal with Barrack One.	Any news on Dunbar?
2 He's still in the Kommandant's office. That's all I know.

1 I understand how you feel, Cookie. It's sort of rough -- one American squealing on other Americans. Then again, Cookie -- maybe that stoolie's not an American at all. Maybe he's a German the Krauts planted in this barracks. They do this type of thing. Just put an agent in with us -- a trained specialist. Lots of loose information floating around a prison camp. Not just whether somebody wants to escape, but what outfits we were with and where we were stationed, and how our radar operates. Could be, couldn't it?	In this barracks?
2 Why not? Just one of the boys. Sharing our bunks. Eating our chow. Right in amongst the ones that beat me up. Except that he beat hardest.	Who is it?
3 That's not the point, Cookie. The point is what do you do with him? You tip your mitt and the Jerries pull him out of here and plant him someplace else, like Stalag Sixteen or Fifteen. Or you kill him off and the Krauts turn around and kill off the whole barracks. Every one of us. So what do you do?	Who is it?

1 I suppose they also know about your distillery and the horseraces?	That's right.
2 Just what makes you and them Krauts so buddy-buddy?	Ask Security.  You tell him, Price. You've got me shadowed every minute of the day. Or haven't you found out yet?

1 Don't ask me. Price was elected Security.	Okay, Security -- what happened?

1 Lieutenant Dunbar? It wouldn't be James Schuyler Dunbar? From Boston?	Yes, it would. Do we know each other?

1 Here we have a typical barrack. It houses seventy-five men. Every one of them has his own bunk, naturally.	Naturally. It would be rather awkward to have three men in one bunk.
2 As for the blankets, you will notice they are very warm. Fifty percent wool.	They also smell of moth balls.  When were they issued? This morning?

1 Why don't we accept, Animal? The worst that can happen is we wind up a couple of lamp shades.	Raus! Raus! All of you!

1 It's chow, Animal! Chow!	Who wants to eat? I just wanna get over there!
2 No you don't! You don't want any broads with boots on!	I don't care if they wear galoshes!
3 You want Betty Grable!	Let me go!
4 Betty Grable!

1 Look at her! Isn't she beautiful! Married an orchestra leader!	So what? There's other women!
2 Not for me! Betty! Betty!	Cut it out. Animal! I'll fix you up with a couple of those Russian women!
3 You'll fix me up!	Sure, Animal! I'll get you over there!
4 How? Pinky Miller from Barrack 8 tried to get over there and they shot him in the leg!	It takes a gimmick, Animal, and I figured us a little gimmick.
5 You did?	Sharp. Sometimes I'm so sharp it's frightening.

1 I'll open mine now.	I'll open mine, too.

1 Look -- if you don't like the way I'm handling this job --	Kill it, Duke. It's got us all spinning.

1 We've all done a poor job of it.	I still say this is my tag. Any objections, Hoffy?
2 Any objections, men?

1 Lay off, Sefton.	With your mother's pull, how come you're not a chicken colonel by now?
2 Lay off, I said -- if you don't want your head handed to you.

1 What are we going to do with him?	Don't you know? Because I got my own ideas.  Let's have that civilian stuff.

1 So was the radio private property. So was Manfredi and Johnson.	What about the radio?

1 Schulz, you're off your nut!	Give me the radio.
2 We have no radio.	All right, gentlemen, I will find it myself. Now let's see.

1 Hey, Schulz -- as long as you're going to move somebody in -- how about a couple of those Russian broads?	Russian women prisoners?

1 You must have been some tail gunner!  Go ahead, Cookie.	Come on, let's get that mail. Anything for Stanislaus Kuzawa?

1 Target their Bridge.	Full disruptors.

1 According to our current information, the destruction of the Amargosa star has had the following effects in this sector: gamma emissions have increased by .05 percent, the starship Bozeman was forced to make a course correction, a research project on Gorik IV was halted due to increased neutrino particles, ambient magnetic fields have decreased by-	Wait. The Bozeman,why did it change course?
2 The destruction of the Amargosa star has altered the gravitational forces throughout the sector. Any ship passing through this region will have to make a minor course correction.

1 Data, you're not thinking about using that thing are you?	It has occurred to me on several occasions. But I believe this may be the appropriate time.
2 Wait a minute. I thought you've always been afraid it would overload your neural net.	That is true. However, I believe my growth as an artificial lifeform has reached an impasse. For thirty-four years I have endeavored to become more "human"- to grow beyond my original programming. And yet I am still unable to grasp such a simple concept as humor. This emotion chip is the only answer.

1 Looks like you're stuck with emotions for a while. How do you feel?	I am quite...preoccupied with concern about Geordi.
2 We all are, Data. But we're going to get him back.	I hope so, sir.

1 That ribbon isn't just some random energy phenomenon travelling through space. It's a doorway. It leads to another place- the Nexus. It doesn't exist in our universe and it doesn't play by the same rules either.	What happened to you?
2 I can't remember very much - what it looked like or how long I was there. But I do remember how it felt.

1 Excuse me, gentlemen, if you'll take your seats.	Oh, of course.

1 Captain of the Enterprise, huh?	That's right.
2 Close to retirement?	I hadn't planned on it.

1 Keep her together until I get back.	I always do.

1 There's still no indication of why they attacked the station?	We think they were looking for something- they practically tore the place apart.
2 Hmm,  Inform Starfleet Command. This could indicate a new Romulan threat in this sector.	You want me to contact Starfleet?
3 Is there a problem?	No, sir.
4 Thank you, Number One.

1 Captain, Im sorry.  I know there were a lot of unresolved conflicts between you and your brother.	What I can't get out of my mind is the image of Rene- my nephew. I just can't believe he's gone.

1 We're all mortal, Soran. It's one of the truths of ou existence.	What if I told you I found a new truth?
2 The Nexus.	Time has no meaning there. The predator has no teeth.

1 It is a Class D-12 Bird of Prey. They were retired from service because of defective plasma coils.	Plasma coils...is there any way we can use that to our advantage?
2 I do not see how. The plasma coil is part of their cloaking device.

1 Shall I alert Dr. McCoy?	Yes. He has a long journey ahead.

1 Aye sir, coding now.	Dr. Marcus, it's your planet.

1 Same sector. Metallic mass.	Underground deposit?
2 Negative, on surface... A manufactured object.	There's only one thing it could be... Short range scan.

1 Saavik... My god, what happened to them?	It would seem that Grissom was destroyed by an enemy attack.
2 You mean, we're stranded down here?!	Logic indicates that is the case.
3 How can you be logical at a time like this?! We have to get thee hell off this planet!	That may be difficult...
4 Why don't you just call for <u>help</u>!	I have already made one transmission too many...

1 Ah, Saavik, that's, ah, extroadinary. What would you, ah, like to do next?	Request permission to beam aboard immediately.
2 Saavik... Does Dr. Marcus think there could be -- any chance of -- ah -- radioactive contamination?	None that I can detect, sir.
3 Well, all the same, I'm going to advise Starfleet and get instructions.

1 Mr. Scott: two photon torpedoes at the ready. Sight on the center of the mass.	Aye, sir!

1 I know you... Do I not?	Yes. And I know you.
2 My father says you have been my friend... You came back for me.	You would have done the same for me.
3 Why would you do this...?	Because... the needs of the one outweighed the needs of the many.

1 See! That shimmering area.	Yes, sir. It's getting larger as we close in.

1 Standby automatic approach system ... Advise approach control.	Approach control... this is Enterprise. Ready for docking maneuver.

1 I say again: Grissom, this is Enterprise. Admiral Kirk calling Captain Esteban or Lieutenant Saavik. Come in!	Report status!

1 Sarek... I would have come to Vulcan... to express my deepest sympathies...	Spare me your human platitudes, Kirk. I have been to your Government. I have seen the Genesis information, and your own report.
2 Then you know how bravely your son met his death.	"Met his death"?  How could you, his friend, have assumed that? Why did you leave him on Genesis! Spock trusted you -- and you denied him his future!
3 I -- saw no future --	You missed the point, then and now... Only his body was "in death," Kirk! And you were the last one to be with him.
4 Yes, I was...	Then you must know that you should have come with him to Vulcan.
5 But -- why?	Because he asked you to! He entrusted you with his very essence -- with everything was not of the body. He asked you to bring him to us -- and to bring that which he gave you: his Katra. His living spirit.
6 Sir. Your son meant more to me than you can know. I'd have given my life if it would have saved his. You must believe me when I tell you that he made no request of me!	He would not have spoken of it openly.
7 Then, how --	Kirk, I must have your thoughts. May I join your mind?
8 Of course...!

1 Why haven't they finished us?... They outgun me ten to one; they have four hundred in crew to my handful, yet they sit there.	Perhaps they wish to take you prisoner.
2 They know we would die first.

1 You amaze me, Commander.	How is that...?
2 A twenty year space veteran, yet you ask for the worst duty station in town. I mean, look at this place: the hind end of space.	Peace and quiet appeals to me, Lieutenant.
3 Well, maybe that's okay for someone like you whose career is winding down. But me: I need some challenge in my life. Some adventure... Even just a surprise or two.	You know what they say, Lieutenant. Careful what you wish for: you may get it.

1 Slide them down your nose. Now look at me over the top. And you read printed matter through the bottom.	Amazing! I don't know what to say --
2 Say thank you.	Thank you.

1 Go? <u>Where</u> are we going?	Where <u>they</u> went. Saavik.

1 <u>Will you please be quiet</u>!  Commander Chekov, this is completely irregular. Who gave the order you are quoting? Who gave the order?	The order comes from Starfleet command, Dr. Marcus, direct from the General Staff.
2 But Genesis is a civilian project, under my control --	I have my orders.

1 Will you please be quiet! We must have order here.  This has to be some sort of mistake.	Mistake? We're all alone here. They waited until everyone was on shift-leave to do this. Reliant is supposed to be at our disposal, not vice-versa.

1 I told you! I told you I saw a --	Ssssh!

1 Where's Dr. Marcus --	I'm Doctor Marcus!

1 Steady on course. All systems normal.	It's not much different from Enterprise.  When I was a guest aboard her some years ago, Captain Kirk kindly allowed me to memorize her technical manuals. And now, Mr. Chekov, let us review: You say you have no details of Project 'Genesis' ?

1 Tactical!	Inoperative.
2 Raise the shields...

1 I don't know you. But you. I never forget a face. Mister Chekov, isn't it?  I never thought to see your face again.	Chekov, who is this man?

1 Mr. Scott on discrete.	Scotty, let's have it.

1 No, sir! You'll flood the whole compartment...!	He'll die -- !

1 I assume you are loitering here to learn what efficiency rating I plan to give your cadets.	I am understandably curious.

1 Carol Marcus --	Yes.

1 You've got to learn WHY things work on a Starship.  It's coming through now, Khan...	The prefix code is 16309. All commands from each Starship bridge are relayed electronically; each ship has its own prefix combination code...

1 Spock!	The ship -- out of danger?
2 Yes --

1 That was a little joke.	Humor... that is a difficult concept ... it is not logical...
2 We learn by doing, Lieutenant.

1 Admiral?	As your teacher Mr. Spock is fond of saying: I like to think there always are possibilities.

1 Saavik, get us out, best speed!	Aye, sir.

1 Mr. Sulu... The shields!	Trying, sir!

1 We're over our heads. Mr. Sulu, get us out of here.	I'll try, Captain.

1 Take her out, Mr. Saavik.	Aye, sir.

1 Well, so much for the tour of our humble plant. I must say, Professor your knowledge of engineering is most impressive.	Back home, we call him the miracle worker.
2 Indeed... May I offer you gentlemen anything?

1 It doesn't look all that different.	Let's hope so, Bones. Mr. Sulu, set us down in Golden Gate Park.

1 Specifically, Humpback Whales.	That's crazy! Who would send a probe hundreds of light years to talk to a whale?

1 What's causing that!?	Captain, their call is being carried on an amplification wave of enormous power!
2 Can you isolate the wave?	Negative. It's impacting on all our systems!

1 Shields, Mr. Chekov.	Shields, aye.
2 May fortune favor the foolish.  Mr. Sulu, Warp Speed!

1 So you were at Berkeley.	I was not.

1 They're gonna hafta take their chances.	What does that mean, exactly? Take their chances.
2 It means that they will be at risk from whale hunters -- same as the rest of the humpbacks.  What did you mean when you said all that stuff back at the Institute about extinction?

1 Wanna try it from the top?	Tell me when the whales are going to be released?
2 ... Who are you?	Who do you think I am?

1 Oh my God, we're too late!	Mr. Sulu: full power descent!

1 Earth... But when?... Spock?	Judging by the pollution content of the atmosphere, I believe we have arrived at the late 20th Century.
2 Well done, Mr. Spock.

1 It's her -- from the Institute. If we play our cards right, we may learn when those whales are really leaving.	How will playing cards help?

1 You got us to the right place, Spock. Now all we have to do is get the whales out before we <u>sink</u>.  Mr. Scott, come in!... Scotty...?!  Damn... Mr. Spock, see to the safety of all hands.	I will, Admiral.

1 10 seconds, sir!	Hover on my mark, Mr. Sulu! Mr. Chekov, stand by de-cloaking -- Scotty, ready for power build up!  Mark, Mr. Sulu...

1 We'll stick together till we get orientated. Bearing to the whales?	283 degrees... 15.2 kilometers...
2 Everyone remember where we parked.

1 Scotty, how long is this bay?	About 60 feet, Admiral.
2 That should be enough. Can you enclose it to hold water?	I suppose I can, sir; are you planning to take a swim?

1 Stand by, sir. Miracle worker at work...	Mr. Scott, don't make jokes, we are in danger of -
2 Full power, sir.	Mr. Sulu, if you please.

1 Professor Scott, if you'll --	I demand to see the owners! I demand --

1 We were under the impression they were being held against their will.	It's not our custom to have guests here at all, let alone hold anyone against their will.

1 There's one thing I don't understand.  In three hundred years...you never learned to swim?	I just... haven't gotten around to it yet.

1 Do you really think your mighty Federation would be interested in protecting six hundred people?	The "mighty" Federation could learn a few things from this village...

1 Can he breathe under water?	Data doesn't breathe.
2 Won't he rust?	No.

1 I believe the boy is... afraid... of me.	It's nothing personal data. You have to remember these people have rejected technology. And you...
2 ... I am the personification of everything they have rejected.	Until this week, that young man probably never saw a  machine, let alone one that walks and talks...
3 And I do not believe I made a very good first impression.

1 Take us into a high orbit.  Lie down, Admiral. The girls will take twenty years off your face...	Another time.

1 Captain, I wasn't expecting you.	This was too important for the Enterprise to be on the sidelines, Admiral...
2 I wish I had better news. Commander Data attacked us in the mission scout ship yesterday. Ru'afo and I have decided to send in an assault team...	Sir, Commander Worf and I have been working on several tactical plans to safely...

1 Gallatin! So the righteous Starfleet Captain finally released you. Did you encounter any problems on the surface?	No, sir. But it wasn't easy... being among them...
2 I'm sure. Just don't forget what they did to us.  We'll have them rounded up in a day or two... we needn't bother with the Federation holo-ship any more. Just get the holding cells ready.

1 I took these out of Data's neural net... they contain memory engrams...	Do you know how they were damaged?
2 By a Son'a weapon.  There's no doubt about it, sir. That's what made Data malfunction.	The Son'a reports claim they didn't fire until after he malfunctioned.
3 I don't believe it happened that way.	Why would they fire at him without provocation?
4 All I know is that he was functioning normally until he was shot. Then, his fail-safe system was activated...	Fail-safe?
5 His ethical and moral subroutines took over all of his basic functions...	So, you're saying he still knew the difference between right and wrong.
6 In a sense, that's all he knew. The system is designed to protect him against anyone who might try to take advantage of his memory loss.	And yet he attacked us. And told the Ba'ku we were a threat...

1 Sir, they've detonated an isolytic burst... a subspace tear is forming...	On screen.

1 Who is it?	Commander Riker...

1 I wish there was a way to bring them back home.	Ask them.
2 I'm afraid there's too much bitterness... on both sides.

1 Direct hit. He's resetting his shield harmonics...	Beam him out!

1 The Ba'ku could use some rest, sir. According to the geo-scan, this may be the safest area for the next few kilometers...	Very well. We'll take an hour. Break out some rations...

1 Nomadic, collectors of precious metals, jewels...	Hmm, I should feel right at home with them...
2 You're in luck... it says here they've taken women from several races as indentured servants.

1 Initiate launch sequence.	Activating injector assembly.

1 He's stable... for now.  But it would be better if we could contact... our friends.	Yes. But until then, you'll have to make do with what you've got.
2 That'll be interesting.

1 Have you ever wondered what it's like to have flesh?	It is impossible to imagine sensations for which I have no frame of reference.

1 No... no, it's so... empty... please... give it back... I need it...	And I need to control this ship. Let me into your mind.

1 But now... they are all one with the Borg.	I am unlike any lifeform you have encountered before. As an android, I am in complete control of my neural net. The information contained there cannot be forcibly removed.
2 You are an imperfect being... created by an imperfect being. Finding your weakness is only a matter of time.

1 Captain, I'm starting to worry about the hull integrity. We've been running the support field at full power for three hours straight. I don't know how much longer it's going to hold up.	Understood. Keep me informed.

1 Ready to make a little history?	Always am.
2 Phoenix to control.  Initiating five minute countdown... mark.

1 There's no temporal shielding in here! We're starting to pick up relativistic effects!	One minute to warp threshold...

1 And what were you doing out at the missile silo?	I'm an old friend of Cochrane's... I wanted to see how he was doing.
2 Lucky for him you came by when you did. He might be dead now.	Yes.
3 Maybe you can tell me what he's been doing in that silo. We heard some explosions out there this morning...	I think he was running a test on an old rocket engine... and one of the fuel cells burst.

1 No... but sometimes I feel that way.  What I meant was, I'd be willing to trade for the photographs.	Trade. Okay. The photographs... for a straight answer.  Who are you? And how do you know Zephram?
2 I'm an old friend... I met him when he was doing his undergraduate work at Cornell back in --	'Fraid not.

1 Life signs?	Population... thirty-five billion...  All Borg.

1 Incoming transmission from Starfleet Command. Admiral Hayes.	Onscreen.

1 I have assigned two damage control teams to locate the source of our communication problems. So far, they've had no success.	Assign another team if you need to. I want to re-establish communication with the Captain as soon as possible.

1 Are you alright?	Just a little queasy...
2 Try not to look at the stars... keep your eyes on the ship.	Right.
3 And Commander, whatever you do... do <U>not</U> vomit in your exo-suit. It would be... unpleasant.	I'll keep that in mind.

1 Worf to Bridge.	Riker here.
2 There's a dampening field in place on this deck. Our tricorders are useless.

1 I'd prefer not to be the President to push the button if I can avoid it.	The longer we wait, the less accessible the hostages will be, Mr. President.
2 I'll bear it in mind, Admiral. I think that's all.

1 What the Hell's going on?	I wish I knew. Uhura?

1 Jim, leave me - I'm finished...	No way.  You see this?

1 Too bad we can't SMELL her.	In space, no one can hear you sweat.

1 It takes a lot of effort.	I don't wonder. Stop me if I'm wrong but do we really have any way of knowing if this is the real you?
2 I thought I would assume a pleasing shape.  We're outside the shield. Now it's your turn, Kirk.

1 Are those your words?	Yes.
2 Spoken by you?	Yes...
3 Louder, please. We cannot hear you.	Those words WERE spoken by me.

1 From Starfleet?	Who else?

1 Mr. Spock, Rura Penthe's deep in Klingon territory. If we're discovered...	Quite right, Mr. Chekov. What is now required is a feat of linguistic legerdemain - and a degree of intrepidity. Before the Captain and Doctor McCoy freeze to death.

1 Thank you, Captain Kirk. The evening has been most... edifying.	We must do this again soon.

1 That's not his knee.  Not everybody keeps their genitals in the same place, Captain.	Anything else you want to tell me?

1 Sorry -	Come on, Saavik, you COULD knock -
2 We're almost at the rendezvous - I thought you'd want to know...	Right -

1 Me?	We have volunteered to rendezvous with the Klingon ship that's bringing Chancellor Gorkon here, and escort him safely through Federation space.

1 I am responsible for involving you in this. I will go.	I'M going. You are going to be responsible for getting me out of this. Meantime we're not going to be the instigators of a full-scale war on the eve of universal peace.
2 Perhaps you're right.

1 What's she waiting for?	Probably trying to figure out why we're reversing, wondering if we detect her.

1 You have done well, Saavik. As your sponsor at the Academy I have followed your career with... satisfaction. And as a Vulcan.	Sir, I speak to you as a kindred intellect. Do you not recognize that a turning point has been reached in the affairs of the Federation?
2 I am not certain such speculations are included among your duties, Lieutenant.

1 But it was when you tried to persuade me the Captain was guilty that I should have understood.	You can't prove any of this...

1 Praxis?	What's left of it.

1 They're outside the beaming shield. Mr. Scott, start your engines.	Aye, aye, sir.

1 They might as well arrest me, too; I felt like Lieutenant Saavik.	But you didn't join a conspiracy.

1 Sort of like losing a son and gaining an empath, isn't it?	Please, Beverly, this is hard enough.
2 If you start tearing up I promise to beam you out. Level one medical emergency.  Theres no crying in Starfleet.

1 But we do have one advantage.  He needs your blood to live. He might come after you first.	I'm counting on it... We've been ordered to head to sector 3274. Starfleet is diverting the fleet to meet us there.

1 Data!	Sorry, sir.

1 Do you think this is a wise course of action?	We're about to find out... Power up disruptors and fire on my mark.
2 Ready, Captain.	Fire!

1 Since positronic signatures have only been known to emanate from androids such as myself, it is logical to theorize that there is an android such as myself on Kolarus III.	How many of you did Dr. Soong make?
2 I thought only me, myself and Lore.

1 No.	I would like to pick you up now. May I do that?

1 How can you be certain?	I know how he thinks.

1 I'm afraid that drink will have to wait, Captain.	Do you have life support?
2 	Understood.

1 He thinks he knows exactly what I'm going to do.	Sir?
2 Weve got him!

1 So, human... you've met your better self!	What are you doing to Counsellor Troi?
2 I'm preparing her for Shinzon. To sooth him as she soothes you. To stand at his side as she does at yours.	That will never happen.
3 Listen to him, android. Such a small and weak creature. Yet he roars so valiantly...

1 Sir, we're being hailed.	On screen.

1 Captain, with all due respect to diplomatic protocols  -- the Federation Council's not sitting out here, we are.	Patience. Diplomacy is a very exacting occupation. We can wait.

1 Serving with you has been an honor.	The honor was mine. Captain Riker.

1 We need to talk, just you and I.	Come to dinner on Romulus tomorrow. Just the two of us. Or just the one of us.
2 You know I need to verify this.	I know.

1 In time, Jean Luc.	In time.

1 I hope you're still alive, Jean Luc.	I am.
2 Don't you think it's time to surrender? I'll have my cloak back in a matter of minutes and your poor ship is shot to pieces. Why should the rest of your crew have to die?

1 Intruder alert!	Let's go.

1 Join us, Commanders.  Now what's the disposition of the fleet?	They're holding position.
2 And?	They will obey, Praetor.
3 It's imperative we retain their allegiance or our great mission will be strangled before it can truly draw breath.

1 What did I tell you?	Probably kids.

1 Well, here we are... You go down that ramp there, you're sure to get a ride.	Thank you.
2 And don't be shy about your English. You speak better than a lot of people I know.  Take care of yourself.

1 Why did you let it get into a populated area?	It's taken on a disguise.
2 Clarify that.	It's made itself look like the woman's dead husband.

1 This is Marc Shermin. Where are you, Mrs. Haydn?	I don't know. Someplace called Elmo's. Look, I just wanted to tell you that I'm all right and I'm on my way home.
2 You've been through quite an ordeal, Mrs. Haydn. Why don't you stay where you are and let us pick you up? We'll fly you home.	No. You'll want to ask a lot of questions I don't want to answer right now. I already have a ride.

1 Steering wheel.	Steering wheel.
2 Gear shift.	Gear shift.
3 Dashboard.	Dashboard.

1 What?	Smile.
2 Smile... good?	Yes.

1 Gas.	Closed.

1 What's the matter?	Shit!

1 But I must go here.	I know that. But the buses don't go there.
2 What is hitchhike?	That's easy. I'll explain that in a minute. This is your ticket. When you get on the bus here, the driver will take this part. You will ride to Omaha. When you get to Omaha, ask the driver. 'Salt Lake City, please. I do not speak English.'

1 What happened?	I was afraid.

1 The machine gave me two. Should I put one back?	No. Get in.
2 You can have one.	I'm not sleepy anymore. Let's drive for a little while longer.

1 What?	Nothing.

1 This is yours...	If you want to keep it, you can.
2 I'd like to...

1 Tell the baby about me.	I will.
2 Goodbye.

1 Wait. Could I have your autograph?	Sure.

1 I'm telling you they're probably friendly.	Then why did they try and sneak in the back door? Tell me that. Why didn't they contact us first and say...

1 Nothing up there... The grass is matted down in a few places, but that could have been anything.	It was the husband. The police finally got a hold of the witness at work and showed him a picture of the woman.

1 Okay, let's get you wired up.  I hope this axle grease you got in your hair doesn't screw up the squid receptors.	What's all this squid shit?

1 This piece of puke hired me to kill you, baby.  Do you believe that? Isn't that right, Tran?  You pinhead.	Oh my God.  I don't believe this is happening.
2 Believe it.  Now bring me the trodes, baby.  Come on, quick.	What're you going to do?

1 Faith, call me, okay?	No, Lenny.

1 I understand.  No, I'm not.	You understand?  Attorney!  Right? Am I right?
2 That's right.

1 I'm telling ya, it's over.  We used it all up--	Shutup a second!

1 Mace... no disrespect... but you run this on the 11 o'clock news, by midnight you got the biggest riot in history.  They'll see the fucking smoke from Canada.	Okay... what about Strickland?
2 No.  Bad idea.

1 So there never was a death squad.	Naawww.
2 Just those two loose-cannon cops running around covering their butts.	Yeah.  Pretty zany, huh?  All this shit caused by a random traffic stop.  Hey... nothing means nothing. You know that.  Look around... the whole planet's in total chaos.  You gotta take what you can, while you can.  Cause some shitbird can come up and put a fuckin' .22 in the back a your head any second.

1 About what?	That would be between me and Faith, wouldn't it?

1 What the fuck are you doing?	Coming with you.
2 You will not live to see the morning.

1 What's that?  Present from Faith?	No idea.

1 No more, Lenny.	Yeah.  I'm ghosting pretty bad.

1 Will you relax.  There's nobody back there.	Mace, the guy had a knife.  To my throat.  In my living room. Relaxing might be right out, okay?!
2 You better keep a low profile for a while.	No shit.  You got someplace in mind?

1 Tell me.	I can't tell you.  You've got to see.
2 Uh unh.  I won't do it.	Mace.  I know what you think about the wire.  But I'm asking you to do this.  It's that important.

1 I worked Vice, Narcotics... Violent Crimes... and I saw every known depravity.  I was lost, Mace.  In outer darkness.  Then I busted this strung-out little teeny-hooker. When I met Faith she was just another runaway giving twenty dollar blowjobs to buy crank.  Another lost soul.	You never told me.
2 But she was different.  There was a light in her eyes... and she had this voice.  It was scary, all that pain coming out of that little body. Like she could take all the hurt and rage of the entire world and lift it up to heaven in one voice.  I helped her.  And I promised her that I'd always be there... to protect her.  See?  It's not about what's in her head.  It's what's in mine.  I can't let go of the promise.  It's... like... it's all I have left.	No, it's not.

1 Well...  Get going.  You're still bleeding.	See you downtown.
2 Yeah.  See you there.

1 Was this him?	Um... he was older.
2 Besides that.	To be honest, when I'm working, I don't look at faces much. He knew the guy's name.
3 Testa?	The bearded guy, the creep. Oh, one other thing. Testa, if that's his name, he kept mentioning my feet. Said I had very pretty feet.

1 Nine bodies in Roswell, now this -- it's getting a little hairy, huh?	I'd appreciate it if you kept this to yourself.
2 I know how the Feds like to sit on information. I got something in the car to show you.

1 Be my guest, Agent Kulok, scrub suits are in the back.	This is Agent Mackelway.

1 The man who was with him, he was a construction worker?	Yes.
2 What did he look like?	I didn't wait on him. Fifty or so, white, regular build, needed a shave -- that's all I remember.
3 How did you know he was a construction worker?	He had an orange hat on.

1 Mackelway, I could understand. He is over-emotional by nature, but you, Agent Kulok, you had a shining career in front of you.	Just step outside, sir. Now. Keep your hands where I can see them.

1 "Murman" was the alter identity of William Heirens, the original "Catch Me Before I Kill Again" killer. Short for "Murder Man." It was the case that got Richard Low and I started in this field.	I spoke with Lloyd Daitz.
2 That gasbag. I can imagine what he said. I'm not ashamed to admit that most of what I know about criminal profiling started with Richard Low. I have also, over the years, I admit, taken credit for many of his accomplishments. He was the most brilliant law enforcement individual I ever met.	"Was?"
3 We had every reason to believe he was on that plane. He was supposed to be on the plane. Everything was incinerated, it was two weeks before we reached the crash site. We, the Director and I, decided it was in everyone's best interest to declare Dick Low dead. That way he could exit a hero.	You suspected all along, suspected he was alive. That's why you came to El Paso.
4 Dunlevy said there was another case, Ron Rice. In fact, there were two earlier cases where serials were murdered. The second was George Sheldon. I didn't enter it into VICAP -- I'll get you the file.	How long ago?
5 Both in the last year. I suspected only someone as brilliant as Dick Low could find these guys.  Look, whatever Daitz told you, nobody wanted to strip Richard of his badge. You have to get close to be good at what he did, the trick is not to get too close.	You knew the arm slash was not "Zorro."
6 I suspected, but you were the one Low contacted. That's why I brought you back here.	What did you think of the Suspect Zero theory?
7 It was neither a valid concept nor a valid fact. Suspect Zero came to represent every killer Dick Low had not caught. The idea took root in his head like a wild irrational vine. For someone like Low, there would always be a Suspect Zero. We couldn't let Richard go where that idea was taking him.

1 Agent Kulok, that boy, as we speak, is in Hawkins' truck, probably still alive, in a dark refrigerated compartment, shivering in just a T- shirt: put yourself in his mind, freezing, terrified, wanting his mother. Put yourself in his mother's place, desperate, imagining the worst is happening as she pleads, back there at the rest stop, for someone, anyone, to listen to her. This is not hypothetical, this is real. It is happening now and you can do something about it.	Shut the fuck up or I'll shut you up.
2 You have to save this boy. Good exists in this world. I can prove it because you can, in your life, save this one person.

1 I ever get like that, just take me out in back and shoot me.	Don't be too harsh.
2 I saw him on a talk show once, talking about these killers like they were his friends. Not the victims, not the families of the victims, he doesn't talk about them. Blood money, that's what it is.  Did he hit on you?	Huh?
3 When you were his student? Did he come on to you?	Of course he did. He came on to every attractive student. Which bothers you most: that he exploits suffering or that he came on to me?
4 You must really think I'm a square, a computer nerd.	No, Mack, I do not think you're a square and definitely not a nerd.

1 There's the Agency issue. I think Koessler may suspect something already. We're not on the best footing with him as it is.	That's true.
2 Then there's the other issue.	What's that?
3 You need time to think. About the case, about you and me.	I found a peephole into Deviant World. I'm gonna reach in and yank some of those creeps out.
4 And nobody else can do that?	Not the way I can.
5 That's my point. Remember, you're a cop pretending to be a deviant. It's not the other way around.	Don't confuse what we do with who we are.
6 I just need to go a little slow.

1 I haven't changed anything.  Damn.	I...
2 I've got to take a piss.

1 Who are you?	I'll give you a little hint. You're a smart guy, figure it out.

1 Was it Zero?	Yeah.

1 "Computer Investigation and Infrastructure Assessment Center." Quantico out of MIT -- you're a techie?  Okay, you screwed up once. So did half the guys here. That's why they're here.	I screwed up twice, sir.
2 I see that. Washington to Philadelphia to here. Philly's a nice station. How many agents?	Four hundred and sixty, sir.
3 "Attitude Adjustment Issues" -- what the fuck is that supposed to mean?	I wished to be reinstated at Computer Crimes. I was undiplomatic in my request.
4 This is a first. You criticized the Deputy Director to his face and you still have a badge? You must have some one-of-a-kind skills.  Why don't you just quit? I mean, you're not going to get promoted, not wearing this jacket.	I like working for the Bureau, sir. I like catching bad guys. It's all I care about.
5 Jesus, just what I need, another blue flamer.  Johnny, get this boy some sun screen.

1 You want to "profile" me? Find out what makes me "tick"? Write about me, go on a talk show, give me a nickname?	It's over for you.
2 Take your shirt off.

1 ...so I thought, what the hell, they make movies in L.A., not in Michigan, so I moved here.	Just like that?
2 Well, it wasn't the simple, but yeah.	How was it hard?
3 Well, I left someone very special behind.	Tell me about it...
4 You too?	Yeah.
5 I thought I was going to die.	It's been six months and I'm just starting to get over it.
6 Oh, God. That's two more than me. Tell me it gets better.	It does.
7 How?	Well, it still sucks, but you start to see that there are advantages to being single.
8 Like what?	What what? What advantages?

1 ...I heard it took four days to light for that shot...	...Four days..?

1 He's so sweet. He really said that?	I believe it too. He really just wants her to be happy.
2 He is so sweet.

1 Sorry, it's just that...	I understand.

1 Hi.	I heard you might be moving back...
2 Yeah, uh, I don't think that's gonna be happening any time soon... Listen, can I call you right back? I gotta take this call...	I'm not home and going out of town tomorrow for a week. Can't you talk for five more minutes?
3 I really want to catch up with you, but I've gotta take this call. They're holding. I'll talk with you when you get back in town. Bye.	Goodbye. I lov... 

1 I can't get over how cute the girls in this city are.	I know. It's like the opposite of inbreeding. The hottest one percent from around the world migrate to this gene pool.
2 Darwinism at its best.	I've been around here six months and I still can't get over it.
3 It's like, every day I see a beautiful woman. I'm not used to that. I'm used to seeing a beautiful woman, I don't know, once a week. I can't handle it.	Wait till summer. I swear, you can't leave the house. It hurts. It physically hurts.
4 I can't wait till I actually get to touch one of them.	Ah, there's the rub...
5 There's the rub.

1 Uuuuugh!	Oh boy.
2 I'm such an asshole.	She wasn't your type anyway.

1 ...which means no one will get there 'til ten.	So, what? Eleven?

1 You live in such a fantasy world...	What about you, Mikey? At least I got balls. You're always whining about some bitch who dumped you a year ago...
2 ...It was six months, and she didn't dump...	...Whatever. You're like a whining little woman. Big deal. You got a fuckin' number. Whoopee! You'll fuck it up...

1 There you two are. I walked around for an hour with that stupid martini on my tray.	Sorry. We got knocked out pretty quickly.

1 Pirates of the fucking Caribbean.	This is the hot new place, besides, you love pirates. Tell me Mikey doesn't love pirates.
2 This is fuckin' post-pubescent Disneyland.	You gotta love the pirates, baby. The pirates are money.

1 Nice, baby.	I should've said Renaissance, right? It went over her head.
2 Baby, you did fine.	"Age of Enlightenment". Shit. Like some waitress in a Las Vegas coffee shop is going to get an obscure French philosophical reference. How demeaning. I may as well have just said "Let me jump your ignorant bones."...
3 ...Baby...	...It's just, I thought "Renaissance" was too Excaliber, it's the wrong casino. She would've gotten it, though...
4 You did fine. Don't sweat her. We're meeting our honeys soon. You know Christy's friend is going to be money.	I hope so.  We gotta go soon.
5 Baby, relax. It's just down the hall. She's gotta change... we'll be fine.	We didn't do so bad after all.
6 Baby, we're money.

1 No.	Yeah.

1 We got the digits, baby.	What a surprise.
2 What's wrong? I saw you talking to that beautiful blonde baby.

1 Because he's a bitch.	That's so bullshit. This is so bullshit.

1 Baby, don't talk that way, baby...	You are so money, and you don't even know it...
2 That's what I keep trying to tell him.  You're so money, you don't even know...

1 It's on...	...it's on.

1 This is Tom Hagen; I'm calling for Don Corleone, at his request.	Yes, I understand I'm listening.
2 You owe the Don a service.  He has no doubt that you will repay it.

1 Don't be frightened.  Do you think I'd make my sister a widow?  Do you think I'd make your children fatherless?  After all, I'm Godfather to your son.  No, your punishment is that you're out of the family business.  I'm putting you on a plane to Vegas--and I want you to stay there.  I'll send Connie an allowance, that's all. But don't keep saying you're innocent; it insults my intelligence and makes me angry.  Who approached you, Tattaglia or Barzini?	Barzini.
2 Good, good.  Leave now; there's a car waiting to take you to the airport.

1 I want somebody very good, very safe to plant that gun.  I don't want my brother coming out of that toilet with just his dick in his hand.	The gun will be there.
2 You're on, kid...I'll square it with Mom your not seeing her before you left.  And I'll get a message to your girl friend when I think the time is right.	We gotta move...

1 My business is heroin, I have poppy fields, laboratories in Narseilles and Sicily, ready to go into production.  My importing methods are as safe as these things can be, about five per cent loss.  The risk is nothing, the profits enormous.	Why do you come to me?  Why do I deserve your generosity?
2 I need two million dollars in cash...more important, I need a friend who has people in high places; a friend who can guarantee that if one of my employees be arrested, they would get only light sentences.  Be my friend.	What percentages for my family?
3 Thirty per cent.  In the first year your share would be four million dollars; then it would go up.	And what is the percentage of the Tattaglia family?

1 It is Johnny.  He came all the way from California to be at the wedding.	Should I bring him in.
2 No.  Let the people enjoy him.  You see?  He is a good godson.	It's been two years.  He's probably in trouble again.

1 I see you have your Luca Brasi.	I'll need him.
2 There are men in this world who demand to be killed.  They argue in gambling games; they jump out of their cars in a rage if someone so much as scratches their fender. These people wander through the streets calling out "Kill me, kill me."  Luca Brasi was like that. And since he wasn't scared of death, and in fact, looked for it...I made him my weapon.  Because I was the only person in the world that he truly hoped would not kill him.  I think you have done the same with this man.

1 You had better bring a few bottles home with you, my friend; you'll need help sleeping tonight. 	This one could seduce the devil.  A body! and eyes as big and black as olives.
2 I know about what you mean!	This was a beauty.  Right, Calo?
3 Beautiful all over, eh?	And hair.  Black and curly, like a doll.  And such a mouth.

1 Is the hospital covered?	The cops have it locked in and I got my people there visiting Pop all the time.  What about the hit list.

1 Kay, we weren't expecting you.  You should call...	I've tried calling and writing.  I want to reach Michael.
2 Nobody knows where he is.  We know he's all right, but that's all.

1 Mike, why are you cutting me out of the action?	Tom, we're going to be legitimate all the way, and you're the legal man.  What could be more important than that.
2 I'm not talking about that.  I'm talking about Rocco Lampone building a secret regime.  Why does Neri report directly to you, rather than through me or a caporegime?

1 I didn't know your family knew Johnny Fontane.	Sure.
2 I used to come down to New York whenever he sang at the Capitol and scream my head off.	He's my father's godson; he owes him his whole career.

1 When will I see you again?	Goodbye.

1 Clemenza?  No, I don't believe it.	You're right, kid, Clemenza is okay. It was Paulie.
2 How can you be sure?	On the three days Paulie was sick this month, he got calls from a payphone across from the old man's building.  We got people in the phone company.  Thank God it was Paulie...we'll need Clemenza bad.

1 We're going to New Jersey?	Maybe.

1 Buy me out?...	The hotel, the casino.  The Corleone family wants to buy you out.

1 What? What?	Meet my father, Herbert Richard Greenleaf 1st.

1 Well, she was already dead, darling, wasn't she, so I suppose --	I don't know why people say this country's civilised. It isn't. It's fucking primitive.

1 Good afternoon!	What time is it?  Oh God! Do you always type your letters?  That should be two Ts.
2 I can't write and I can't spell. That's the privilege of a first-class education. You're upstairs at the back. I think Ermelinda made the bed up.	This is so good of you.
3 Don't say it again. Now you're a Double Agent and we're going to string my Dad along, I was thinking we might buy a little car with the expense money he's sending you. What do you think, Marge... a little Cinquecento with my Dad's money?

1 Means we never shared a bath. I'm cold. Can I get in?	No!
2 I didn't mean with you in it.	Okay, you get in. I'm like a prune anyway.

1 I wanted to tell you my plan.	So tell me.
2 I thought I might come back. In the New Year. Under my own steam.	Really? To Italy?
3 Of course. Let's say, for argument's sake, you were here -- perhaps we could split the rent on a house -- I'll get a job -- or, better still, I could get a place in Rome and when we're there we could be there and if we're here we could be here --	Oh God, I don't think so.
4 You see, particularly with the Marge problem, you can just blame me.	Marge and I are getting married.
5 How?	How?
6 Yesterday you're ogling girls on the terrace, today you're getting married. It's absurd.	I love Marge.
7 You love me and you're not marrying me.	Tom, I don't love you.
8 No, no, it's not a threat, I've explained all of that.	I'm actually a little relieved you're going, to be honest. I think we've seen enough of each other for a while.

1 No. No, I'm staying here for a few days, in Rome. That's a new piano, so you prob --	Did this place come furnished? It doesn't look like Dickie. Horrible isn't it? -- so bourgeois.

1 Pretty good. Sticking with hot water.	Where's Mr MacCarron?
2 San Remo. The police are amateurs. Well, my boy, it's come to a pretty pass, hasn't it?

1 I never said that!	Bird. That's jazz.

1 Hello Marge.	Tom, you startled me! You're back.
2 How are you? Sorry. Is your book going well?	Yes -- I'm on a good streak, thanks.
3 I was just looking at you --  so quiet.	Where's Dickie?
4 I think he's planning on staying in Rome for a few days.	Ha. Did he say why?
5 I don't know. I don't understand Dickie, Marge, so your guess is as good as mine.	What does that mean?
6 Well, one day I'm invited skiing, the next day I'm not, one day we're all one family, the next day he wants to be alone. You tell me.	Is that what he said -- he wanted to be alone?
7 He was thinking of you, Marge -- he asked me to deliver this.

1 Look at me what?	To the manner born.

1 Dickie? Do you know Dickie?	You were at the Opera? Well, that explains -- yes I was there. I was there with Dickie.
2 I told you! I knew it!	Marge, I don't know you, so I have no right, but Dickie loves you. He's -- I think you'll find he's coming home to you.
3 How would you know that?	He told me everything. I was supposed to meet him fifteen minutes ago, so I... I'm going to go now, I think. Unless he meant us to meet -- which would be a little cruel, wouldn't it?

1 What's your secret?	Excuse me?
2 No, it's just -- you are American, aren't you? -- no, I just, I have so much luggage, and you're so, uh, streamlined. It's humiliating.

1 Dickie, my God!	Hello Meredith.
2 I was looking at you, your clothes, I wouldn't have known you...	Well, you've spotted me and so you get the reward.
3 What?	Just kidding. Are you alone?
4 Hardly. I couldn't be less alone.

1 Yes, what happened? I heard you were desperate to come. I was looking forward to rowing you around.	I am. I really am. And I've been travelling. I just can't seem to get that far north.
2 Well hurry, before we sink.  Should I give you my telephone number in Venice?	Thanks.

1 He wants to know if you killed Freddie Miles and then killed Dickie Greenleaf?	No I did not. I did not kill Freddie Miles and then kill Dickie Greenleaf. Is he accusing me?  Ask him if he's accusing me!
2 He's already angry, I don't think --	Just because he doesn't like Americans!

1 Good things about Tom Ripley? Could take some time!... Tom is talented. Tom is tender... Tom is beautiful...	You're such a liar...
2 ...Tom is a mystery...

1 Some of these guns are like toys, but a Smith and Wesson, man, you can hit somebody over the head with it and it will still come back dead on. Nothing beats quality.  You interested in an automatic?	I want a .32. Revolver. And a palm gun. That .22 there.
2 That's the Colt .25 -- a fine little gun. Don't do a lot of damage, but it's as fast as the Devil. Handy little gun, you can carry it almost anywhere. I'll throw it in for another $125.

1 Travis, I never ever met anybody like you before.	I can believe that.
2 Where do you live?	Oh, uptown. You know. Some joint. It ain't much.
3 So why did you decide to drive a taxi at night?	I had a regular job for a while, days. You know, doin' this, doin' that. But I didn't have anything to do at night. I got kinda lonely, you know, just wandering around. So I decided to works nights. It ain't good to be alone, you know.
4 After this job, I'm looking forward to being alone for a while.	Yeah, well...  In a cab you get to meet people. You meet lotsa people. It's good for you.
5 What kind of people?	Just people people, you know. Just people.  Had a dead man once.
6 Really?	He'd been shot. I didn't know that. He just crawled into the back seat, said "West 45th Street" and conked out.
7 What did you do?	I shut the meter off, for one thing. I knew I wasn't going to get paid. Then I dropped him off at the cop shop. They took him.
8 That's really something.	Oh, you see lots of freaky stuff in a cab. Especially when the moon's out.
9 The moon?	The full moon. One night I had three or four weirdos in a row and I looked up and, sure enough, there it was -- the full moon.

1 ...there's plenty of movies around here. I haven't seen any of them, but I'm sure they're good.	No, Travis. You're a sweet guy and all that, but I think this is it. I'm going home.
2 You mean you don't want to go to a movie?  There's plenty of movies around here.	No, I don't feel so good. We're just two very different kinds of people, that's all.
3 Huh?	It's very simple. You go your way, I'll go mine. Thanks anyway, Travis.
4 But... Betsy...	I'm getting a taxi.

1 Try holding the match like this.	This is gotta be a game, right?
2 This I gotta see.	Ouch!
3 Oh, are you all right?	I'm great. Always set my fingers on fire. If you want to see another trick. I do this thing with my nose.
4 No. I just wanted to see if you could light it that way. The guy at the newsstand can.	Ah, yes, the guy at the newsstand, Mr. Asbestos...
5 He happens to be missing fingers. I first noticed when --	Is he Italian?
6 No, why?	You sure he's not Italian?
7 He's Black, OK?	Well, If he had been Italian, they could have been shot off. Sometimes the mob does that to teach guys a lesson, If they blow a job or something.
8 As I said, he isn't Italian. Besides, I thought they just killed them.	Don't be naive. They can't kill everybody. They have different punishments for different things. Like, if they kill a stool pigeon, they leave a canary on the body. It's symbolic.
9 Why don't they leave a pigeon instead of a canary?	I don't know. Maybe they don't leave a canary. Don't be technical. What I'm saying is if this newsstand guy's Italian and his fingers are gone, maybe he's a thief.
10 First, he's not Italian. Second he's not a thief. I noticed the fingers when he was getting my change -- the right change. Two of his fingers are missing. Just stubs. Like they were blown away. I was putting my change in my purse when I saw him get out a cigarette. I couldn't help watching. I was dying to see how he'd light it.	With the other hand, right?
11 No, stupid. With the stubs. That's the whole point.	I know that guy. His hand looks like a paw. An old Black guy, the newsstand at --
12 No, this is young -- well, I'm never sure how old Black people are -- but, anyway, he isn't old. That's for sure.	Show me how he did that again.

1 Yeah. We went to Harvard together. 	We call him Dough-Boy cause he likes the dollars. He'll chase a buck straight into Jersey.
2 Look who's talking?  Who else would stay up all night to catch the morning rush hour?

1 Hello.	You looking for some action?
2 Well... I guess so.	All right.  You see that guy over there?  His name is Sport. Go talk to him. I'll wait here.

1 ...and after that Sport and I just started hanging out...	Where is home?

1 Travis, what single thing would you want the next President of this country to do most?	I don't know, sir. I don't follow political issues much.
2 There must be something...	Well, he should clean up this city here. It's full of filth and scum. Scum and filth. It's like an open sewer. I can hardly take it. Some days I go out and smell it then I get headaches that just stay and never go away. We need a President that would clean up this whole mess. Flush it out.

1 Look, um, if you give me your name and address, we'll send you the information on how to apply.	You would, huh?
2 Sure.	My name is Henry Krinkle -- that's with a "K." K-R-I-N-K-L-E. I live at 13 1/2 Hopper Avenue, Fair Lawn, New Jersey. Zip code 07410.  Got that?
3 Sure, Henry. I got it all. We'll send you all the stuff all right.	Great, hey. Thanks a lot.

1 Look, a person does a certain thing and that's all there is to it. It becomes what he is. Why fight it? What do you know? How long you been a hack, a couple months? You're like a peg and you get dropped into a slot and you got to squirm and wiggle around a while until you fit in.	That's just about the dumbest thing I ever heard, Wizard.
2 What do you expect, Bertrand Russell? I've been a cabbie all my life, what do I know?  I don't even know what you're talking about.	Neither do I, I guess.
3 You fit in. It's lonely, it's rough at first. But you fit in. You got no choice.	Yeah. Sorry, Wizard.
4 Don't worry, Killer. You'll be all right.  I seen enough to know.	Thanks.

1 It's me sir.	What is happening?  Where's Mason?

1 Limp dick?	It's all I could think of.

1 St. Michael's Church, Fort Walton, Kansas.  Front pew.  Right leg. = Hollow.	What's that?  Mason?

1 Tell them Pete.  Tell them...	Mr. Chairman, as I understand it, the Fifth Amendment pertains to self-incrimination, and I can't incriminate myself because I've done nothing wrong.  Besides, incrimination is why you have Mr. Clyde working for you.

1 You can all go home, now.  He's not going anywhere.	Go on home, folks.  And thanks for the welcome.

1 Were we going to get married?	Eventually.  We were going to be  engaged... when you came back from  overseas...

1 Delly, shhhhhh...	No... I can't... I have to... I can't...

1 I'm a little hesitant to say.	The witness need not be hesitant to say anything before this committee, as long as it's the truth.

1 Are you saying that he's...	Shhhhhh.

1 Nine and-a-half years ago.	Nine and-a-half years...

1 But I...	Son, I think you loved the Bijou even more than I did.  You've got to remember that.  You've got to.

1 I'm here.	Did you... did you...
2 Did I what?	Did you fix the damn film?  It broke in the last reel.
3 I know.  Everyone went home.  We offered them refunds.	Anybody take it?
4 A few.	Vultures...

1 Do you remember if you were driving a car?  Maybe you went over the bridge.  No guard rail there, it's easy to do.  It's happened before.	It's possible.  I just don't remember.
2 And you don't know your name or who you are, that right?	I... no, I... I just can't...
3 It's okay, son.  We just need to call you something.  That's all.

1 You think he's drunk somewhere?	Wouldn't blame him if he was.
2 Well, his rent's past due and he said to call you in case of an emergency.  He lose his job or somethin'?	What's his rent?
3 Thirty a month.

1 Her name was right there in front of them.  They gave it to me, I didn't give it to them.	Well, that's not what they think.
2 Leo, she was... she was a girl I knew in college...	You should keep track of your old school chums.  Turns out she eventually joined the communist party.  On top of which, she's Lucy Angstrom Hirschfeld now, and she happens to be a writer for "Studio One" on CBS.
3 Oh god, oh, god, no, I...	So, our lawyers had a talk with the Committee's lawyers.  That Elvin Clyde fella won't be too happy about it, but we cut a deal. They cleared you -- and they're gonna thank you publicly for your testimony purging yourself.
4 Thank me publicly?  For what?  For ruining this woman's life?	Climb down off your cross.  They already knew about her.  She was subpoenaed six months ago! Who the hell do you think named you?

1 Can I... Can I t-t-talk to you?	Sure.  Come on in.  I was just packing.

1 I suppose.  Thanks.	You look familiar, fella.  What's your name?

1 I've been wanting a cigarette for the past twenty minutes, but I couldn't convince myself to stop. This 'tilling of the soil' can get a little compulsive, you know.	It's a lovely garden.
2 Thank you. It gives me something to do with my spare time.  There's a lot of spare time in Bodega Bay.  Did you plan on staying long?	No. Just a few hours.
3 You're leaving after you see Cathy?	Well... something like that.  I'm sorry. I don't mean to sound so mysterious.
4 Actually, it's none of my business.

1 Thank you.	It gets a little chilly here at night sometimes. Especially if you're over near the bay.

1 Mitch, can I bring the lovebirds in here?	No!
2 Mom, they're in a cage!	They're birds!

1 Mitch? Why are they doing this?  The birds.	I don't know, honey.
2 Why are they trying to kill people?	I wish I could say. But if I could answer that, I could also tell you why people are trying to kill people.

1 How much for the phone calls?	It's nothing.

1 Gulls!	They're back!

1 She's a charming girl, isn't she, Mitch?	Yes, very.
2 And certainly pretty.	Yes.
3 How long have you known her?	I told you. We met yesterday.
4 In a bird shop.	Yes.
5 She was selling birds.	No. I only led her into believing I believed she was... Mother, it's really very complicated.
6 But she did buy the lovebirds and then brought them all the way...	Mother, where did you go to law school?
7 Forgive me. I suppose I'm just naturally curious about a girl like that.  She's very rich, isn't she?	I suppose so. Her father owns a big newspaper in San Francisco.
8 You'd think he could manage to keep her name out of print. She's always mentioned in the columns, Mitch.	I know, Mother.
9 She is the one who jumped into that fountain in Rome last summer, isn't she?	Yes, Mother.
10 Perhaps I'm old-fashioned.  I know it was supposed to be very warm there, Mitch, but... well... actually... well, the newspaper said she was naked.	I know, Mother.
11 It's none of my business, of course, but when you bring a girl like that to...	Mother?
12 Yes?	I think I can handle Melanie Daniels by myself.
13 Well...  So long as you know what you want, Mitch.	I know exactly what I want, Mother.

1 They're gone. The same pattern.	But they'll be back.
2 We won't be here.	Where can we go, Mitch? There's no place to go.
3 I want to try for San Francisco. There are buildings there. Steel and concrete!	We'd never make it. They're probably all over the road.
4 We have to try it.  We can't stay here.  Melanie needs help.  Mother, the house won't take another attack.	If...  If... when we get to San Francisco...  If they're already there?
5 They won't be.	If they are?
6 We'll worry about that when we get there.	I'm frightened, terribly frightened. I... I don't know what's out there, Mitch.
7 What do we have to know, Mother? We're all together, we all love each other, we all need each other. What else is there? Mother, I want us to stay alive!	I started to say... inside...
8 You don't have to.

1 That's a chimney swift, all right.	We know what it is, Al.

1 Well, where did he go?	Bodega Bay. He goes up there every weekend.
2 Bodega Bay? Where's that?	Up on the coast. About sixty miles north of here.
3 Sixty...  Oh.	About an hour and a half on the freeway. Or two if you take the coast highway.
4 Oh.	I'd hold the birds for him, but I'm going away myself. Someone's got to feed them, I suppose.
5 Yes. Yes, someone's got to feed them.	I'm awfully sorry.

1 So you came up to see Annie, huh?	Yes.
2 I don't believe you.  I think you came up to see me.	Why would I want to see you, of all people?
3 I don't know. But it seems to me you must have gone to a lot of trouble to find out who I was, and where I lived and...	It was no trouble at all. I simply called my father's paper. Besides, I was coming up here anyway, I already told you...
4 You like me, huh?	I loathe you. You have no manners. And you're arrogant and conceited and... I wrote you a letter about it, in fact, but I tore it up.
5 What did it say?	None of your business.  Am I still bleeding?

1 I really shouldn't have any more. I'm a little tipsy already.	I'm trying to get you to stay for dinner. We're going to have a lot of roast left over.
2 I couldn't possibly. I have to get back.	Cheers.
3 Cheers.

1 What it was, probably...	Mmm?
2 They're probably hungry, that's all. This was a bad summer. They eat berries and... and nuts, you know, and the hills are all burned out, so they're probably searching for food wherever they can get it.	With my little sparrow leading team.

1 When will they stop?	I thought they'd have stopped by now.
2 What time is it?	Almost two a.m.
3 You must be exhausted.	How about you?

1 That... that... who was that?	I have no idea.

1 Doesn't it seem odd that they'd wait all that time to start a... a war against humanity?	No one called it a war!

1 Then fight back. Get yourselves guns and wipe them off the face of the earth.	That would hardly be possible.

1 Dr. MacFarlane said I should pay you --	Of course -- it's the soul of the business -- the pay --

1 Even so, I could never think of going on -- I've got to find some other profession.	It is a pity.

1 You know how we get the specimens we use for dissection?	From the Municipal Council -- they're the bodies of paupers --

1 But, I didn't ask him to kill.	Who would believe that?  And you know, someone else might recognize her.  She was as well known as the Castle Rock.

1 This is not a woman!	It was a woman when we put her in.
2 Hold that lamp up -- I must see her face.

1 He'll not leave the grave -- not since Wednesday last when we buried the lad.	Your son, ma'am?  He must have been a fine boy for the wee dog to love him so.

1 Oh, it's you, Gray. Well, come in. Sit down. Have a glass with me.	You're uncommon friendly tonight, Toddy. More like the old days.

1 Have another glass of something good, Toddy.	I've drunk enough tonight.
2 Another little drop'll never do you any harm.

1 You and I should work together.	You mean we would sell the bodies to the doctors together? Dig them up?
2 No digging Joseph. The churchyards are too well guarded. We will "Burke" them,	Burke them?
3 You are lately come to Scotland, Joseph?	I come from Lisbon.
4 But still you may have heard the peddlers of verse cry out their names on the streets.

1 And why not?  He's a good lad -- bright and able.	Aye.  He's a good lad.  That's why I ask you, MacFarlane.
2 You think it'll spoil the boy, eh? Was I not assistant to Knox?	Aye --
3 Did it spoil me, Meg, my lass?

1 Was that it? Well, ok.	I'm not dying for your goddamn illusions. You got that? You think you and your girlfriend had some rosy future ahead of you? Bullshit. She was already bored, why do you think she was looking around? You're nothing, Corvis! Less than nothing.

1 Fuck! What do you want?	A scar. On the arm. Of the man who planted this in Alex Corvis's car.
2 There's no scar, you freak. The Corvis kid made it up.

1 Fucking Zombie.	The scar.
2 There is no scar. I'm telling you.

1 I've been shot, and stabbed and thrown from a car and none of it hurt. But what you're doing now, does. I don't know why.	My dad was right! He said you'd ruin her life.
2 No. Listen to me. Lauren found out something they didn't want her to know.  This.

1 ... it connects you to me...	No matter what happens... you're innocent... I promise...

1 Maybe we had a case of that here.  Get me my kit.	You two are majorly demented. Anyone ever tell you that?

1 I want to take this to Lauren. She'd want it.	Honey. I just can't.
2 Stay in the car. I'll only take a second.	Erin. I know you think she's been talking to you.
3 It's not that. Really. It's just... now that he's gone, I think it's time.

1 You should see it, Professor Barnhardt! You should go out and see it for yourself!	Thanks -- I'm enjoying it right here.
2 The whole city has stopped. People are running around like ants!	What a brilliant idea. I never would have thought of it.

1 Bet he is, Mom. Bet he's out looking for that space man.	I think we've all been hearing too much about "space men."

1 Now think back hard. You didn't follow Mr. Carpenter at all, did you? You haven't even been out of the house.	Yes, I have!
2 You didn't really see the space ship. You just thought you did.

1 You think they'll ever find him?	I don't know, Bobby. I'm inclined to doubt it.
2 Mr. Carpenter -- what does velocity mean?	Velocity is the time rate of change of position.

1 Aw, gee -- we didn't finish our story.	We'll finish it tomorrow... Goodnight, Bobby.
2 Goodnight.

1 We could call a special meeting of the General Assembly... But of course the UN doesn't represent all of the nations.	Then why not a meeting of all the Chiefs of State?
2 Believe me, you don't understand. They wouldn't sit down at the same table.

1 I wonder if we ought to--	Bobby and I have had enough excitement for tonight.
2 You think it's all right for you to stay here?	I've got a good lock on my door.  And Bobby's going to sleep in my room tonight.

1 Excuse me. I was just going up to my room.	Goodnight, Mr. Carpenter.

1 Where are you going now?	Back to the boardinghouse. I'll be safe there for the afternoon -- and I can keep an eye on Bobby. He's the only other person who knows anything about--

1 Oh, I see. He was having trouble and you were helping him out.	That's right.
2 I suppose you know that Barnhardt does a lot of secret work for the Army.	In this case the secret wouldn't be worth much. He doesn't know the answer himself.
3 But I suppose you know the answer.	It's really quite simple... The three- body problem, you know.

1 All day.	Can't stand light?
2 Wears sunglasses in the <u>house</u>.

1 Okay.  Where's Nosferatu?	The Prince of Darkness.
2 The nightcrawler.  The bloodsucker.	El Vampiro.

1 So how do you like those maggots, Michael?	What?...
2 You're eating maggots.  How do they taste?

1 You can't kill me, Star.	I will, David!
2 No, Star.  Put it down.  Put it down.

1 Just so you know:  If you try to stop us, or vamp-out in any way, I'll stake you without thinking twice about it.	Chill out Edgar.

1 Lucy, you're the only woman I ever knew didn't improve her situation by getting divorced.	A big legal war wasn't going to improve anybody's situation.  We've all been through enough.  Besides I was raised better than that. Thanks for having us, Dad.

1 Hi... I'm Laddie.	This is Michael.

1 Sure.	Does that mean we are, or we aren't?
2 We are...	Then let's act like friends. Let's talk.  I know this is a new place, and --

1 Lights out, Sam.	Soon as I finish this comic.  Okay?

1 You've got a generous nature.  I like that in a person.  My name is Max.	Lucy.
2 So what can I help you find tonight, Lucy?  We've got it all.  Best selection in Santa Carla.	I'm not looking for a tape.  What I need is --
3 -- a job.	Do I look that needy?

1 Something the matter?	No, no.  Just worrying about my boys -- as usual.
2 Let me tell you something about boys.  They're like weeds.  They grow best when they're ignored.	I thought you said they needed discipline?
3 Well... what do I know?  I'm a bachelor.  Lucy... this is going to be a very special night, I promise you.

1 What's your name?	Star.
2 Oh.  Your folks, too, huh?	What do you mean?
3 Ex-hippies.  My mom was one.   I came this close to being called Moon Child, or Moon Beam or something.  But Star's great.  I <u>like</u> Star.	Me, too.
4 I'm Michael.	Michael's great.  I like Michael.

1 They'll be coming for Laddie and me, won't they?	They'll be coming for <u>all</u> of us.

1 Go away.	You're supposed to watch me and entertain me, and make me appreciate the brief but happy years of childhood.
2 Entertain yourself.

1 What did you to do him, Michael? Why did he bite you?	He was protecting <u>you</u>!

1 Pretty nasty out, Mac.  Thirty-five knots.	Screw it, I'm going up anyway.

1 Couldn't make much of it myself.	I've asked him to try and locate the site.  Okay with you?
2 Sure.  You think there's a connection?	Maybe.

1 How you doin', old boy?	I don't know who to trust.
2 Know what you mean, Blair.  Trust is a tough thing to come by these days. Just trust in the Lord.	Watch Clark.
3 What?	Watch him close.  Ask him why he didn't kennel the dog.

1 Could have been anytime.  Anywhere.	If it did get to him.

1 Cut him loose of the line up by his shack.	Cut him loose?
2 When we were up poking around his place... I found this...

1 What do we do about those three?	We got morphine, don't we.

1 Load of bullshit.	We'll see.  Let's try Clark.

1 Well, who's got access to it?	I guess I'm the only one.

1 I don't see how... when I'm finished I return it right away.	When was the last time you used it?
2 A day or so ago... I guess.

1 You're not thinking of going after them, are you?	I am going after them.

1 How's that Thing get to the dogs?  I though we stopped it in time.	Copper thinks they swallowed pieces of it during the fight.
2 And that was enough?

1 What if it doesn't come?	It'll come.  It needs us.  We're the only thing left to imitate...  Give me a hand.

1 Get back!!	The generator!
2 Screw the generator!!

1 It's got into the pub!  It's turned on the stereo!	What?!
2 It's in between us and them!!  How we going to get back?!	Can't hear you.

1 I had a friend who came here once. Sort of a dare.	What happened?
2 He came back screaming... He never talked about it after that.  I don't think he even got this far.

1 So, Relic, you want to open Pandora's box, do you?  See all the mysteries exposed?	Yes.
2 And if the truth is so horrible that it will haunt your dreams for all time?	I'm used to that.

1 They raise them like cattle... Feed them until they're ready and then hunt them.	No...
2 How are your dreams now?

1 Why?	We have lost the capacity to reproduce.  But the species must continue.
2 So you take their best...	When a creature shows too much independent thought we remove them from the gene pool.  We're breeding them for submission.  Soon they will be fully domesticated.
3 You took her because she helped me.	Yes.  Initiative and daring are not desirable traits in the Eloi.  But you should be happy for her.  She won't remember the creature she was.  She will... become.

1 May I help you?	I -- what are you?!
2 I am the Fifth Avenue Public Library informational kiosk.  VOX registration NY-114.  May I help you?	What's happening to the moon?!

1 Let's walk through the park...	No... let's walk through the city.
2 All right...

1 Let them.	I have something for you...

1 It's my Jamie's birthday today. Your godson.  He's nine years old. At his party he asked me if Uncle Alex was coming.  I told him no. Then he asked me if you didn't like him anymore.	For God's Sake, David --
2 There are some things I need to say to you.  You may not like hearing them, but I don't know if I'll ever get another chance --	You care for me.  And you're concerned.  And I have to start living my life again.  I hear it from Mrs. Watchit every day.
3 But you won't listen.  You won't see me, you won't see anyone.  What would you like me to tell Jamie? That Uncle Alex is busy?  That Uncle Alex is hiding up there in his laboratory --	Hiding?
4 You know that's what it is.  Mrs. Watchit tells me you're here at all hours -- day and night --	That's because I'm working.  You remember that?  You used to care about your work.
5 I care more about my life.  And yours.

1 Did you hear me, lad?	All right, all right -- here -- everything --

1 Why?	Why not?
2 Why would you do that?

1 ... It was a great city.  The greatest city in the world.	You liked it there.
2 Oh, very much...  ... I used to work somewhere in that direction, I think.  A huge university where we taught everything from botany to history to literature.	Learning was important?
3 Oh very.  Learning, commerce, the arts -- the whole place was buzzing all the time.  Night and day.	Did you have fires at night?
4 Only to keep warm.  For illumination we had gaslights on most of the streets and a new invention called electrical lighting that made it seem like daylight all through the night.	It must have been safe.
5 Oh, it was...  ... Most of the time.	It sounds like a wonderful place to live.
6 Looking back... I suppose it was. I didn't quite realize it at the time but...

1 Oh huzzah, the master's home.	Do you have it?!
2 Hello, Mr. Philby.

1 Yes, sir.	Very good.  Now if you will excuse us for a moment.

1 My fowl have polluted the yard.	Dean Fulton...

1 I don't know what to tell you, sir. He's been gone this whole week.	And you've no idea where he went?
2 No, sir.

1 Relax.	Don't act like I don't know what's real. [Beat] I'm not the one that's crazy here.
2 [Pointedly] Of course you're not.

1 You died, Starks. Years ago, in the hospital.	I know. [Beat] You killed me, didn't you?
2 No. I didn't. I swear I didn't. I probably helped push you to kill yourself, but I didn't do it.	I didn't kill myself. I died from a blow to the head. How'd it happen? I have to know.

1 We're late.	I wish they'd skip the formality of this annual review and just cut our budget. Our silence on the matter should be enough to appease the civic conscience without wasting an hour we don't have.
2 Maybe it's not such a waste.

1 I'm sorry? Your face looks awfully familiar, I just can't quite place it...	Mom, this is the guy that drove us home that afternoon we were stuck on the highway. The guy you yelled at for no good reason...
2 Oh, yeah.

1 Stop it! Stop it! JACKIE covers her ears and looks at him, pleading with her eyes. STARKS' eyes plead right back.	I'm sorry for upsetting you, [beat] but I'm not lying to you.
2 You can't be William Starks. He's dead.	[Beat] What?
3 William Starks is dead... [Beat] I've been to his grave.	[Beat] What?
4 His body was found New Year's Day, 19...1993. At Alpine...

1 I don't believe a thing she just said.	Me neither. Who was the boy she was talking about, Eugene?
2 I have no idea.	You think Lorenson kills you?
3 Maybe. I don't know. Seems more likely Becker does, but at the very least she knows how I died.	Let's see if they have an address for Becker. I also want to figure out more about the kid you helped her with.
4 Why?	Because that's the part I believe is true. You probably did help her somehow with the boy and Eugene's name did come up over and over again on the abstracts I pulled.

1 They've got lives to be grateful for.	William, you're not making sense.
2 [Beat] They're at Church. And I bet that's where Becker is.

1 I think so.	You're bleeding pretty bad there.

1 At the end, he made me change my mind about a lot of things.	You thought my father was crazy?

1 I don't know. [Frustrated] Remember?	Come on. Tell me what you do know.
2 [Beat] I've seen a time that's not this time. And I'm only able to see it when I'm in the Jacket.	Well, what time is it?
3 2004.

1 I'm not gonna let that happen.	You still don't believe me, do you?
2 I do believe you...	No. Listen to me...the kid, Eugene...

1 Oh no, you're pretty young. Your body'll be able to handle a lot more of it than you think...	No. [Beat] I mean I found out while I was in it that my body's gonna be found in four days.

1 In case you hadn't figured, it's Christmas Eve. You're never gonna get a cab here.	[Beat] Thanks.

1 You want a drink?	Sure.

1 Damnit, Thelma, don't holler like that!  Haven't I told you I can't stand it when you holler in the morning.	I'm sorry, Doll, I just didn't want you to be late.

1 How do you know I took it?  How do you know they didn't just give it to me?	There's two girls out there that had a chance, they had a chance...!  And you blew it for 'em.  Now they've gotten in some serious trouble, some very serious trouble and for at least part of it, I'm gonna hold you personally responsible for anything that happens to them.  I've got no feelin' for you.  But I may be the only person in the world who gives a rat's ass what happens to them and you're either gonna tell me every damn thing you know, so there's a small chance I can actually do them some good, or I'm gonna be all over you like a fly on shit for the rest of your natural life.  Your misery is gonna be my goddamn mission in life.  That's a sincere promise.

1 This is serious, son.  A man is dead.	I know!  I'd tell you if I knew! Goddamn!  I know something happened, or she wouldn't have left.  I'm trying to remember everything!  Find that fucking kid.  He probably knows something.

1 Your name's Harlan?  I got an uncle named Harlan!	You do?  Is he a funny uncle? 'Cause if he is, then he and I got somethin' in common.

1 Louise, is that you?	Thelma?  It's me.

1 I am funny.  I'm real funny.	Are you in town?  This sounds long distance.
2 No, I'm out of town.  I'm in... I'm in real deep shit, Jimmy.  Deep shit Arkansas.	Louise, just tell me what the hell is going on here!  I come back, nobody knows where you are.  Is Thelma with you?  Darryl's been callin' here every half-hour sayin' he's gonna kill you both when you get back, he's goin' nuts.  I don't envy her if she is.

1 Okay, peaches, okay.  But can I ask you one thing?	Maybe.
2 Does it have something to do with another guy?  Are you in love with him?	It's nothin' like that.
3 Then what?!  What, goddamnit, Louise!  Where the fuck are you going?  Are you just leaving for fucking ever?  What, did you fuckin' murder somebody or what?!

1 Is this your car?	Yes.
2 You wanna come with me, please? Walk around and get in the car, please.	In the back?
3 Front.	Am I in trouble?
4 As far as I'm concerned, yes, ma'am, you are.

1 Jeez, Louise, that wasn't very nice.	Can't you tell when somebody's hittin' on you?
2 So what if he was?  It's all your years of waitin' tables has made you jaded, that's all.	Maybe.
3 Well, just relax, will ya.  You're makin' me nervous.

1 We're gonna go to the next town and stop.  We'll get a motel room.  I can rest for a while and then figure out how to get some money.  We're gonna need money.  Thelma.  How much money do you have with you?	What?  Oh, I don't know.  Let me look.

1 I just don't see what it would hurt just to give somebody a ride.  Did you see his butt?  Darryl doesn't have a cute butt.  You could park a car in the shadow of his ass.	I'm sorry.  I'm just not in the mood for company right now.  Here.  Take this map.  I need you to find all the secondary roads to Mexico from Oklahoma City.  I think we should stay off the interstates.  We're too conspicuous.
2 Well, it looks like we can get on this road 81 that heads down towards Dallas, then cut over to...	I don't want to go that way.  Find a way that we don't have to go through Texas.
3 Wait.  What?  You want to go to Mexico from Oklahoma and you don't want to go through Texas?	You know how I feel about Texas... We're not going that way.
4 I know, Louise, but we're running for our lives!  Don't you think you could make an exception just this once?!  I mean, look at the map. The only thing between Oklahoma and Mexico is Texas!	Thelma!  I'm not gonna talk about this!  Now find another way or give me the goddamn map and I will!  You understand?
5 No, Louise.  How come you never said what happened?

1 Eighty-eight dollars ain't gonna make a dent, baby girl.	Don't worry about it.  You want anything?
2 No.

1 Fill her up.  There's a phone right over there.	Let's get it over with.

1 Oh, Christ.  I hate this guy.	We should have just ignored him.

1 Ready?	Hit it.

1 He said they're charging us with murder.	Eeuww.
2 And we have to decide whether we want to come out of this dead or alive.	Gosh, didn't he say anything positive at all?

1 How far are we from Mexico?	About two hundred and fifty miles.
2 How long do you think that'll take?

1 You're a good friend.	You, too, sweetie, the best.

1 Isn't that just my luck -- I get caught for everything.	So you admit it?
2 Guilty as charged. I'm not gonna play games with you. I could give you a song and dance but what's the point? I did it and we all know it.  The hitcher himself told me it's illegal. The irony...

1 You're leaving it out. Finish your swing.  You're going to like this one -- she's half Asian, half American.	Good-looking?
2 I just told you, she's half Asian. half American. They're all good looking. You could mate Don Rickles and Yoko Ono and they're going to have a gorgeous kid. It's a foolproof combo.

1 Mary's a babe!	What?
2 My Mary -- she's not in Japan, she's single, and she's got no rugrats. She does have a little gambling problem, she plays the football cards a bit too much, but she's a babe, a surgeon babe!	Huh? But why did Healy?
3 Well think about it.

1 Think about it: After you've had sex with a girl and the two of you are laying in bed, are you nervous?	No.

1 Woogie from Borrington high? Sounds like a loser.	Loser? Woogie was all-state football and and basketball and valedictorian of his class.

1 Okay? With this pad, the killer wheels? Looks like you really cleaned up your act.	What can I tell you? It's a healthier lifestyle down here, and it's easier to succeed when your head's clear. Those guys I worked with back in Boston, they were a bad influence.
2 Fuckin' animals. Hey, what do you say we go grab a couple drinks.	Not for me, buddy. I don't drink anymore.
3 Yeah, and you don't drink any less, right?

1 Why didn't you just tell her the truth?	I don't know. I guess... it just seems that women today are more impressed by the mighty buck than by some schmo who spent the last seventeen years scraping by on Peace Corp wages.

1 What are you doing with all these blueprints?	Some buildings I'm working on.
2 Are you... an architect?	Well, just until I get my PGA Tour card.

1 Ah, I'd sell that. Start fresh in a new place, quit the architect game, slow things down, read more books, see more movies...	You're a movie buff?
2 Try to be. It's tough going with the crap they make today. If Dumb and Dumber's the best they've got to offer I say thanks but no thanks.	Have you seen it?
3 No. But the Boston Globe critic Jay Carr hated it.	A fucking moron.
4 Huh. I guess I just wish they made them like they used to. You know, something like The Heartbreak Kid... or Harold and Maude.

1 Are you okay?	Not to worry. So... see you tonight, right? Right?
2 Sure.

1 But you know, you shit out a bunch of kids, you're going to put on a few pounds.	So she's married?
2 Nope. Never been.	Huh?
3 Four kids, three different guys.	Three different guys?
4 Well I'm guessing. There's a black kid, two whites, and a midget.	Oh my.
5 Hyperactive little fuckers, too. Tough to keep up with in a wheelchair, I bet.	She's in a wheelchair?!

1 You fucked me, man? Why would you do that?	What do you mean 'why'?
2 Answer the question, shitball.

1 Okay, Pat, take it easy -- don't do anything stupid.	Who the fuck do you think you are making up that bullshit about me?!

1 I swear! I didn't tell her nothing! You probably did it yourself, you piece of shit.	Oh that makes a lot of sense. Why would I rat myself out?
2 Like I'm going to try to figure out a guy who's idea of courting is blowing farts in the chick's face	You were following us?
3 Don't flatter yourself -- I was following her, I always do. How the hell you think I got rid of Mary's boyfriend Steve?

1 Have you been up all night again?	Bet your ass I have. It's an important job, Neighborhood Watch is.
2 Neighborhood Watch? Is that what you call listening in on stranger's phone conversations?	These ain't strangers, they're neighbors. This only picks up signals in a half-mile radius.
3 Meaning?	Meaning these are the people you live amongst, you got a right to know if they're creeps. For instance, did you know there's a guy down the hall cheating on his wife?
4 You picked that up on the scanner. We gotta move.	I confirmed it on the scanner. I knew something was up because Puffy used to bark like hell whenever he saw him and you know Puffy only barks at bad people.

1 Don't bet on it. Last time I had a pap smear the guy needed leather gloves and an oyster shucker.	So maybe I could find a nice gentleman to take you to the movies.
2 Knock it off, Pollyanna, just 'cause you're in love doesn't mean everyone else has to be.	Love? Come on, I wouldn't call it love.
3 Oh no? I ain't seen you beaming like this since you broke ninety on the Blue Monster.

1 He's a nice guy, isn't he?	Well that's what I'm trying to figure out. How long have you known him?

1 Name's Norm. I live up in Pompano with my folks.	Oh Jesus...

1 Oh my God... Ted.  What are you...? I can't believe this. I haven't seen you since --	Yup, that's right. Junior prom... kinda.
2 And did everything -- ?	Oh yeah, healed right up. No visible scars.

1 You hit the ball pretty good for a fourteen.	No short game.

1 That's really sweet, Ted, but you should save it for one of your books.	All right, let's go.

1 Get over here.	Really?
2 Really.

1 Teddy, hon, are you okay?  OH HEAVENS TO PETE!	Would you shhh! Mary's gonna hear us.
2 Just relax, dear. Now, um... what exactly are we looking at here?	What do you mean?
3 I mean is it... is it...?

1 We're here, Warren. You wanna get off?	Giddy-up.

1 This private assurance represents the word of the Highest Authority?	Yes.
2 And it can be relayed beyond Comrade Khruschev's ears to the top circles of my government	Of course. Our pledge can be relayed to any government official Secretary Khruschev sees fit to satisfy.

1 We're going to have to stop a ship eventually, show the quarantine's got teeth, or we'll prove McCone right.	McNamara's on his way back here now. We need to pick the right ship. No subs. No armed boarding parties either. We need a little more time to figure this one out.

1 Adlai's too weak! We have to convince Jack to pull him, get McCloy in there.	You can't take him out this late in the game.
2 Zorin will eat him alive!	Then talk to your brother, goddamn it. The two of you don't need any advice to get into trouble.
3 What's gotten into you?

1 Yeah?	Kenny. It's over.

1 And the second condition?	Time is of the essence.

1 Does this attack on our plane represent a definitive, intentional escalation on the part of the Soviets?	The Soviets are in control of the SAMs. It's hard to believe with their centralized command structure that it could be an accidental launch.

1 Secretary of Defense...	Dean Rusk!
2 Wrong, and you get to wax my car.

1 Call me Irish, but I don't believe in cooler heads prevailing.	Acheson's scenario is unacceptable. And he has more experience than anyone.
2 There is no expert on this subject, no wise old man.

1 We can horsetrade with Khruschev on ships. But it doesn't get us any closer to removing those missiles.	Have to hope it's a signal that he'll back down on the real issue too.

1 At least it will expose whether Khruschev has been overthrown. We'll know what we're dealing with.	And if this is a move to appease the hard line, then it may just be the bone he needs to regain control of his own house.

1 Anyone stops us going in, we're with the Bowen-Hamilton Textile Company. We have rug samples.	Rug samples.
2 We are one-dimensional, boring peddlers of fine carpet, Carl.

1 Levoi, Cooch. Raymond Levoi, Criminal Division.	Oh, yeah -- right.

1 Respect the dead, Hoss. Because when --	-- did you understand me when I said that --
2 -- violation of the Major Crimes Act on an Indian Reservation is within the jurisdiction of the Federal Bureau of Instigation. I know that.	Goodbye.

1 I did.	Who the fuck is he?
2 -- a fucking cop.

1 White eagle feather through the circle. That's their symbol.	That's right.

1 Alright. Alright...	Yeah, alright, alright -- fuck you -- give a yuppie a badge and he wants to take over the world. Go get a tail on Eagle Bear, and stay with her. Cuz Jimmy's gonna show. And I want you to make the collar.

1 Come on, Ray. Come forward.	No way, Cooch.

1 Why does he wanna see me?	Good question. Hardly sees anybody anymore. Hasn't left this place in twenty years. Did you bring some tobacco?

1 Jimmy didn't do it, Ray. I checked it out. You can stop taggin' my sister.	She's your sister?

1 Still after Jimmy?	They found prints at Blue Legs' place.
2 Yeah. Jimmy's prints are there. But they cross over Benjamin Black Star's prints. And he wasn't there until six o'clock the mornin' after to get eggs from the chickens. So Jimmy wasn't there til the next day. Follow?

1 This Clear Moon's house?	Yeah. It's time to beat the drum. You better wait here. He don't trust the white man.

1 You take care.	If you ever need a place to come back to and listen to the trees a little... we'll be here.

1 X22. Read.	Go ahead, Ray.
2 I have a pick-up truck. No plates. Subject -- Indian -- entering suspect's house. Over.	Okay, Ray. I'm coming in. If he starts to leave the area, move in. And hold him. Over.

1 You ever try solitary confinement?	No. Can't say that I have, Richard. Richard do you know why I'm here?
2 Washington sent ya. I know that.	Yes, Washington sent me, Richard. They sent me here because this whole thing has been fucked. Do you know what I mean when I say this whole thing has been fucked, Richard?

1 Yeah, most likely.	Was there ever a girl who didn't like fighter pilots?
2 I heard of one once.

1 The what?	You know. The finger.

1 Does it bother you?	They know the rules... That's the deal. That's why you're up there. It's him or me. That's the price of admission.  It bothers you, why? You're part of it.   Everybody dies. Most people don't get to die for something.

1 ...they say you're alright.	I'm fine.
2 This is it, then.	What?
3 The dark side. The price you pay for all the fun you're having. You knew about it, of course. Didn't you?	He was a friend of mine. A good guy...great guy. It was my fault.
4 That's not what I hear.	I was flying...my responsibility.
5 That's what you get flight pay for.	Maybe I shouldn't take it.
6 Why? You act like you didn't know one day this would happen.	Not to me.
7 You knew it. You all do. It's part of it. Maybe the most important part.

1 You didn't mean it. You didn't think. You'd do anything to take it back.	That's three.
2 And that's one!

1 Yes, Sergeant?	Remember one thing.
2 Sir?	Outside of this gate... I...am Top Gun.
3 Yes sir!

1 Help me with this one, I'm really screwed up.	Bring it left. Bring it left, You're high.
2 This is crazy!	What is?
3 Wait! Hell!..Something's wrong!	What?  What is it?
4 Were upside down!	You're crazy. We're level.
5 Can't you feel it? I'm hanging in my straps!	You're not. We're level. Look at the instruments, we're okay!
6 They must be broken. I'm hanging in my straps! We're inverted!	We're not! Trust me! We're okay.

1 Ohhh Mother!	Goddamnit, Mav, you really are a slow learner. Don't worry, Fung, I've got it.

1 Let me do the talking.	Oh, no. You did the flying, I'll do the talking!

1 Nice. Always a good idea to show up your instructors. He nods toward Jester, glaring at them from his A4. Goose indicates the backseat of the Tomcat.	Hey, see any controls back there?  And anyway...we beat the Son of a Bitch!

1 Ahhh...A little high on the left, don't you think?	Right.

1 Relationships are a bitch, here. It's hard enough to concentrate ...under the pressure. Having a woman here is asking for it.	I guess that's what I'm doing, then.
2 Where do you find the time? Where do you find the energy. It's tough enough to keep your mind on school. A woman here is a real pain in the...

1 But, Skipper, Cougar's been picked for Top Gun...He's the best of the best!	Well, you'll just have to make do with him .

1 GET OUT OF THERE, YOU'RE UNSAFE. GET OUT OF THERE.	FIRE, OR CLEAR OUT, ICE.
2 GET LOST!	YOU GOT TOO MUCH NOSE TO TAIL -- I'M COMING IN.
3 IT'S MY SHOT.

1 I don't know what to tell you, Skip.	Tell me one thing.

1 Morning, Coogan.	How's it goin', Coog?

1 SNAPSHOT..MISSED HIM..	ENGAGING THE OTHER GUY. WOOD, YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.

1 What's wrong with this one?	He ain't got five kids to feed.

1 Need a ride?	The Last Resort!  Quick!

1 Well, my boy, you're a hero.	Fuck you.
2 Don't be modest.  Kuato's dead; the Resistance has been completely wiped out; and you were the key to the whole thing.

1 He had help.  From our side, sir.	I know that.
2 But I thought...	Who told you to think?!  I don't give you enough information to think!  You do what you're told!!  That's what you do!
3 Yes, sir.

1 Okay, this is what we're gonna do. Renata, cover up any memory he has of us or Rekall.	I'll do what I can.  It's getting messy in there.
2 Ernie, dump him in a cab.  Around the corner.  Tiffany, you help him.  I'll destroy his file and refund his money.  And if anybody comes asking...we've never heard of Douglas Quaid.	Come on...put his head in place.

1 You're strapped into an implant chair, and I'm monitoring you at a psycho-probe console.	Oh, I get it; I'm dreaming!  And this is all part of that delightful vacation your company sold me.
2 Not exactly.  What you're experiencing is a free-form delusion based on our memory tapes.  But you're inventing it yourself as you go along.	Well, if this is my delusion, who invited you?
3 I've been artificially implanted as an emergency measure.  I'm sorry to tell you this, Mr. Quaid, but you've suffered a schizoid embolism. We can't snap you out of your fantasy. I've been sent in to try to talk you down.	How much is Cohaagen paying you for this?
4 Think about it.  Your dream started in the middle of the implant procedure. Everything after that--the chases, the trip to Mars, your suite here at the Hilton--these are all elements of your Rekall Holiday.  And Ego Trip: You paid to be a secret agent.	Bullshit.  It's all coincidence.
5 What about the girl?  Brunette, athletic, sleazy and demure; just like you specified.  Is that a coincidence?	She's real.  I dreamed about her before I even went to Rekall.
6 Mr. Quaid, can you hear yourself? "She's real because you dreamed her?"	That's right.

1 If we don't hand you over, everybody in the sector'll be dead by morning.	We don't have much choice then, do we?

1 You shoulda listened to me, Quaid. I was there to keep you outta trouble.	Harry, you're making a big mistake! You've got me mixed up with somebody else!
2 Unh-uh, pal.  You've got yourself mixed up with somebody else.

1 Look at this shit.	What the hell is this?

1 ...You mean it?	You know I do.

1 You call this a paranoid delusion?!	Doug...

1 Let's see...the basic Mars package will run you just eight hundred and ninety-nine credits.  That's for two full weeks of memories, complete in every detail.  --A longer trip'll run you a little more, cause you need a deeper implant.	What's in the two week package?
2 First of all, Doug, when you go Rekall, you get nothing but first class memories: private cabin on the shuttle; deluxe suite at the Hilton; plus all the major sights:  Mount Pyramid, the Grand Canals, and of course...  Venusville.	How real does it seem?
3 As real as any memory in your head.	Come on, don't bullshit me.
4 I'm telling you, Doug, your brain won't know the difference.  Guaranteed, or your money back.	What about the guy you lobotomized...Did he get a refund?
5 You're talking ancient history, Doug. Nowadays, traveling with Rekall is safer than getting on a rocket.  Look at the statistics.

1 I don't remember you.	What are you talking about?
2 I don't remember you.  I don't remember us.  I don't even remember me.

1 Not bad, for a hooker.	I'm not a hooker!  That's my cover.

1 What's wrong?	I just has a terrible thought...What is this is all a dream?
2 Then kiss me quick...before you wake up.

1 What?  Well, for chrissake, we could have made a stand at our place!  We had food, water...	You can't fight'em that way...
2 You two jackasses hauled us way the hell out here...!?

1 Negative copy on that, Pham, check your frequency.  I'm on forty-nine.	Burt, can you hear me now?
2 Just barely, Pham.  What are you all doing up on your roofs. What the hell's going on?  Come back.

1 There's nothing like them in the fossil record, I'm sure...Okay, so they predate the fossil record...  That'd make them a couple of billion years old...and we've just never seen one till now.  Right.	I'd vote for outer space.  No way those are local boys.

1 Hi, guys.  Burt loaned me his camera.	Howdy, Rhonda.
2 You're really leaving, huh?	You bet.  You gonna be staying up here?
3 Well, yeah!  There's going to be major research up here.  First thing is to get some pictures of that one we dug up.

1 Catch it later, Pham.  Gotta get over to Nestor's.	Right.  We plan ahead.  That way we don't do anything right now.  Earl explained it to me.

1 You're full of shit.	He's only got one damn jacket. That's him, I'm telling you.

1 Slick as snot and I'm not lying.	Fifteen lousy bucks.
2 A man who plans ahead.

1 Pham Van don't get his mitts on <u>this</u> for no measly fifteen bucks!	You got <u>that</u> right!

1 Don't he have a home to go to?	Well, that's why Edgar never got down off that tower.

1 Watch your ass, shithead.	Don't worry about me, jerkoff.

1 Christ, Val, maybe she's not your type, but you could, at least, be civil.	Civil?  I'm civil.
2 You're not civil, you're glum.  We got the world by the tail with a downhill pull and all of a sudden you go glum on me.

1 Val, we're going to have to forget about the truck...	Yeah, Heather, we got you.

1 Hi, I'm Rhonda.  Rhonda LeBeck. I'm up here for the semester...	Yeah, geography.
2 Right, geology.  And you have to be Val and Earl.  I've heard all about you.

1 Look, the situation hasn't changed. We still have to get to solid rock. There must be <u>some</u> way!	Like <u>what</u>?!  There's nothing left that'll make it to the mountains!

1 The photo on the left shows the bullet that killed Jimmy Chin, true?	True.
2 And the one on the right is the bullet you test-fired from Shu's gun?	Correct.

1 Objection.	Sustained.

1 No it's not the only issue. There's another issue, for the jury. What about entrapment?	What about entrapment?

1 It's just... I leave behind friends, family, a coupla good job offers in Chicago and in three dizzying weeks I've helped acquit a coke dealer, a speed dealer --	I specialize, Roger...
2 -- an angel dust dealer --	I'm not a kid anymore, I can't be all over the map --
3 -- a speed manufacturer --	So go take your job on Wall Street.
4 Don't tell me where to work. I moved to New York to work for Edward Dowd. But I can't believe that Edward Dowd has nothing better to do these days than invoke exalted legal issues to get off guilty little --	Hey. You plan to be a criminal defense attorney, know this going in: Everybody's guilty.

1 Eddie... What's a DD-5?	A Complaint Follow-Up form.
2 -- Listen: "November 5, 1980. Cecil Stipe walked into 5th Precinct. Says he witnessed Chin shooting, saw suspect's picture in Post. Says Shu Kai Kim wrong man."	"Cecil Stipe"? Have we seen any affadavit with that name?

1 So what're we gonna do?	...What do you mean?
2 Well, I mean, Roeder's gone, now... A dead end. Believe me, I'm sorry too, but...	But what?
3 I've heard from the last ballistics expert on the list. It's an even ten who say Shu's gun killed Jimmy Chin!	That's why I hate experts.
4 Eddie... it's one thing to compare Clyde Gruner to Jesus Christ. It's even okay to claim that Shu Kai Kim is just slightly holier than the Pope... as long as you don't really believe it!	Hey -- you believe what you want. Shu Kai Kim is innocent.
5 -- Eddie...	You know how I know? 'Cause Reynard says he's guilty, and Reynard's full of shit! Look --

1 Pardon... Which dialect do you speak?	Neither.

1 A fucking wheelchair?	I didn't put him in a wheelchair. Reynard did. He can get around without one -- it's all in my report.
2 I don't have time to read every word in every report, I'm too busy getting killed in court... Meantime my crackerjack investigator can't find the goddam art supplies store where Chuckie-fucking-Roeder works!

1 But why would a guy would do that? Paint black teardrops on his face?	I guess he... wanted you to think he was... somebody he wasn't.
2 But why?	Maybe... because someone's afraid.
3 Afraid of what?	I don't know. The truth, maybe.
4 -- About what?	About Chinatown. What went down.
5 What went down?	You tell me, man.
6 No. You tell me, Shu.	How can I tell you what I don't know!
7 You can't. So tell me what you do know -- say it!	I don't know shit, man! Goddammit --
8 Well I know that you're innocent, Shu -- even if you forgot.

1 Are you willing to testify that the man you saw shoot Jimmy Chin was not the man the cops arrested?	They g-got the wrong g-guy.
2 When the D.A. hears I filed the writ, he'll send someone here, maybe claiming to be a journalist. That person will ask you lots of questions. Just be truthful, Cecil, okay? To all of us?	I always t-tell the truth.  That's why I'm here.

1 I'll prosecute anyone who fucks up. If that makes me look racist, it's a trade-off I'll live with, Ed.	That's big of you, Bob.

1 Lou Sklaroff, Vin Badalato, Dave Montell.	The same three detectives on the Jimmy Chin case.

1 What were you... Why were you at Shu's trial this afternoon?	-- What trial?

1 I think what Eddie wants to say is --	No! They g-got the wrong guy! I saw it! The killer wasn't Chinese.

1 Here he comes.	Here he comes.

1 GOD. I'm beginning to lose faith in the United States Government and that includes the telephone system. Don't you folks talk to one another. That's her trailer there and I haven't touched a god damn thing. Agent Chet Desmond come by a second time and asked too see Deputy Cliff Howard's trailer  ...which I showed him. I went back to my trailer...  After that I never saw him again.	Thank you, Carl.

1 What are you doing here in the trailer court, Deputy?	Maybe I just live here, what do you think about that?
2 Can I ask you where you were the night Teresa Banks was murdered?	You can tell J. Edgar that I was at a party and I got fifteen fuckin' witnesses.

1 QUICKLY MEN... WORD ASSOCIATION, COOP. WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW?	Teresa Banks.
2 ALBERT?

1 He's with me.  Anything you would like to tell us about Teresa Banks that would help us out?	I've thought about that. I think her death is what you would call a "freak accident".
2 Thanks.

1 Accidental?	Agent Desmond, would you hold the finger for me. There's something up there.

1 I couldn't help but notice that you had a suspicion that Deputy Cliff was the murderer. You did think that, didn't you, Agent Desmond?	He's not the murderer.  But he's a bozo.
2 Yes, he is like a clown.

1 Laura?	Donna, are you my best friend?
2 Of course...

1 No.  I don't need to take this to be your friend.	YES YOU DO, DONNA. What a downer you are!!!

1 You're not Bob are you, Harold? If you are, you can kill me right now. Kill me right now, if you are.	Laura, no, I'm not. I'm not Bob.  Poor Laura. I wish I could help you.

1 I've got to see you.	Not now.
2 This afternoon?	Okay.  Oh god, it's Johnny Horne's birthday today.
3 What about tonight?	I can't tonight.
4 What's going on?	I just can't, James. I can't do it.

1 You lied to me about those school books. I found them upstairs on your bed.	What were you doing in my room?
2 I was looking for that blue sweater that you borrowed which I found balled up in the bottom of your closet. Now why did you lie to me? Where did you go?	I had to see Bobby. I know you really don't like Bobby, but there was a problem and I didn't think you would understand.
3 Oh, honey, you don't have to lie to me. Ever. You can tell me anything. I'll understand.	I'm sorry, Mom.
4 Now hurry, dinner's almost ready. Your father says he's starving.

1 Who was that?	A friend from school.
2 A special friend?

1 Did you get this from your lover?	They don't call them lovers in high school, Leland.
2 Bobby didn't give you this?	How would you know if Bobby didn't give her that?

1 Come back as soon as you can.	If Leo comes here, he won't believe that I am out doing the "Meals on Wheels".
2 Don't worry, Shelly, I'll handle Leo.

1 This is going to drive the ante up.	Frank Galvin's... who's calling please? Bishop Brophy's office...

1 Your Honor, Bishop Brophy and the Archdiocese have offered plaintiff two hundred and ten thousand dollars.	Huh!
2 My doctors didn't want a settlement at any price. They wanted this cleared up in court. They want their vindication. I agree with them. But for today the offer stands. Before we begin the publicity of a trial. For today only.  When I walk out that door the offer is withdrawn.  As long as you understand that.  It's got to be that way.

1 Mary Rooney, the obstetrical nurse...	What did these people do when her heart stopped?
2 We went to Code Blue...	'Code Blue,' what does that mean...?
3 It's a common medical expression, it's a crash program to restore the heartbeat. Dr. Marx cut an airway in her trachea, to get her oxygen, her and the baby... Ms. Nevins...	Why wasn't she getting oxygen...?
4 Well, many reasons, actually...	Tell me one?
5 She'd aspirated vomitus into her mask...	She THREW UP IN HER MASK. Let's cut the bullshit. Say it: She THREW UP IN HER MASK.

1 Dr. Thompson. From your review of the hospital records of May twelfth nineteen seventy-six.	In your opinion, what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye?
2 Cardiac arrest. During delivery her heart stopped. When the heart stops the brain's deprived of oxygen. You get brain damage. That is why she's in the state she's in today.	Now, Dr. Towler's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes. In your opinion is his estimate correct?
3 It's my opinion it took him much longer. Nine... ten minutes. There's too much brain damage.

1 I appreciate -- a man as busy as --	That's perfectly all right. I'm kind of rushed. Do you mind if we walk while we talk?

1 Thank you.	You're really...  You, are you the one they told me was the nurse?
2 Who told you that?	Mrs...
3 Mrs. Simmonds.	Yes.
4 I used to be a nurse.	That's a wonderful profession. My daughter-in-law's a nurse. What did you do, stop?

1 Do we have time this morning to...  All right. Mr. Galvin, you want to continue now, or we can resume with Dr. Thompson this afternoon.	Thank you, your Honor, I'll continue. Dr. Thompson. Did you examine Deborah Ann Kaye last night at The Northern Chronic Care Facility?

1 Would you like me to leave...?  Is this a bad time -- ?	What...?
2 Is this a bad time.	We, we... No... we just had a small reversal in the case...  I have some, uh... I have some work to do...
3 What happened...?	They, uh, they got to my witness.
4 ...and is that serious?

1 Mr. Galvin's...	Let me talk to Mickey.

1 I... please. My wife... my wife's prescription has run out. If I can call him...	Dr. Halpern's taking all his...
2 No, no, no. I have to talk to him. If I can only call him...	He's... you can't reach him, Sir. He's in the, on some island in the Caribbean, they don't have a phone.  He'll be back in a week...  If you'd like Dr. Halpern's number...

1 Jimmy? Bushmills.  Lookit, do me a favor. I'll buy you a drink tomorrow.	Yeah? And what are you going to do tonight?
2 I'm going to get laid.

1 'You guys are a bunch of whores... uh... loyalty... you don't care who gets hurt... you don't have any loyalty...'	...one of the other nurses?
2 Who? They're all testifying. Everybody who was in the O.R.'s going to take the stand.	All right. Who wasn't in the O.R.?
3 What difference can that make...? All right...

1 Dr. Towler...	Yes.
2 You have a record of what happened in the operating room...	Yes, that's correct.
3 ...there are notations every thirty seconds...	Yes.
4 ...of the procedures...	Yes, the roving nurse...
5 But those notations stop...  ...Four-and-one-half minutes after Deborah Ann Kaye's...	We, we were rather busy...
6 Four-and-one-half minutes after her heart stopped.  And they resume seven minutes...	As I've said we had some more...
7 ...they start again three minutes earlier...	We had rather more important things on our mind than taking notes.  We were trying to restore her...
8 What happened in those three...	...we were trying to restore her heartbeat.
9 What happened in those three minutes...?	We'd gone to 'Code Blue,' we were administering electro...
10 Why did it take that long to get her heartbeat...

1 There's only one thing that will stop the Martians!  We've held back pre- viously because of the danger of radiation to civilians.  Now there's no choice.  The United Nations has voted authority to the United States.  The White House will confirm an order to use the Atom bomb.	Then our first target will be the initial landing place outside Los Angeles.
2 I'll request the scientists from Pacific-Tech to monitor the drop.  We'll clear the area all around.  After that we'll hit them all over the world. I'll have long-range bombers alerted, loaded and standing by.

1 They've all stopped at the same time.	There's only about one explanation for a thing like this..Got a pin?

1 I've been as close to them as anyone. But not close enough for real observation...	I feel like I did one time when I was small.  Awful scared and lonesome...I'd wandered off - I've forgotten why - but the family and whole crowds of neighbors were hunting for me.  They found me in a church.  I was afraid to go in any place else.

1 That's what knocked the phones out, too.	How could it happen to everybody's watch together?
2 Have you got a pocket compass?

1 Colonel - shooting's no good!	It's always been a good persuader.
2 Couldn't you try to communicate with them first - and shoot later if you have to?

1 Number three to. D.O....Number three to D.O.	D.O. to number three..come in.
2 We're getting this under control. Won't need any more help.  Over.	Okay.  Send the tanker in, but you stand by until that thing cools off. Over.
3 I think somebody ought to check on it. Over.	Well, there's some fellows fishing at Pine Summit might be interested.  They probably saw it come down.  I'll let 'em know...What's it look like?

1 Bob, how long has Wes been working on this script?	I don't know.  A couple months.  Why?
2 And since you've been thinking of making it.  Has anything funny happened?	I don't follow.
3 Like weird calls, by any chance?

1 What's up?	Chase, you'd better come home.
2 Heather, I'm stuck here.  Neither Chuck or Terry came in today.  I can't get away!	Chase, it's Dylan!

1 Ms. Langenkamp.  I suggest you go home and get some rest.  Your son is fine. He's been taken downstairs for further testing.	He was just here!
2 He was here.  You fell asleep.  We took him.  You looked so exhausted, frankly, we didn't wake you.  Besides, the young woman, Julie, is with him.  Believe me, everything is fine.	Everything is not fine!

1 Time for sleep.	Say how they find their way back home.

1 And...what's the man doing?	Trying to get up...trying to get into our world.

1 Yes.  It's a story.  A story for a movie.	Read me some?

1 Freddy, for all I know.	Steady...

1 Heather, what is it?	Dunno.  Just have this feeling today...

1 Isn't there anyone that can stop him?	Interestingly enough, in the dreams there is one person.  A gatekeeper, so to speak.  Someone Freddy's got to get by before he can enter our world.  It's you, Heather.
2 Me?  Why me?	Dramatically speaking it makes perfect sense.  You played Nancy, after all, the first to humiliate and defeat him.
3 That was Nancy, not me!	But it was you that gave Nancy her strength.  So to get out he has to come through you.  And it's inevitable that he'll hit you at your most vulnerable points...

1 He would have loved this.	Your father?
2 All his years at sea, he never stopped talking about these islands.	You miss him.

1 We'll bear off to port and run down wind.	Mr. Lawford, stand by to ease the mainsheet.  Rick, get on the jib sheet.  George, John, Philip, Tim and Dick go aloft to unstop the forecourse.  George will show you what to do.  Tod, show your men the forward pinrail and stand ready on the buntlines and clewlines. Forecourse first... work upward.

1 Make us proud.	Yes sir.

1 Yeah.	My old man split along time ago.  It doesn't mean anything.  You just take care of number one that's all that matters.

1 I couldn't have done it without you.	Yes you could.  You did.  This is all you.  Nobody else.

1 Can we talk?	I guess.

1 How ya doing?	Fine.
2 Good.	Look, I appreciate, you know, the concern and all, but like he said, I can take care of myself.
3 I just brought you something to eat.

1 That's how he died you know.	Who?
2 My brother.  He fell out of the old beech tree.  Broke his neck.  I was on a camp out.  They started going at it, throwin' things, a real knock down...  They didn't find him 'till the next morning.  They didn't even know why he was up there.	Jesus, you never told them?
3 I couldn't.

1 Shouldn't we turn away?	You can't run from the wind son. You trim your sails, face the music and let the chips fall.  Bill, let's close her up, dog, tight.

1 Why didn't you turn hard to port as the wind hit?	I thought we'd have a better chance if I headed into the wind so we could spill air from our sails.

1 What is it we can do for you today?	Well, we've come to give our boy a little break from the monotony.

1 Immortality.	Spirits have a way of bringing that out.
2 And being sixteen.	They're in a hurry to grow up.  They don't know about consequences or responsibility.  That's being sixteen too.  I promise you one thing...
3 What's that?	They'll know about it in the morning.

1 I'll read it.  I mean I don't mind.	Shut up donut.

1 This isn't just a story!!  It's history made allegory.  It is a philosophical handbook for life!  It holds the secret of this very voyage.	What is it... the secret?

1 They're waving... handkerchiefs or something.	What?

1 Do you have something to say?	No.
2 Then keep your mouth shut.

1 Is it true that you forced Robin Weathers to climb the mast when it was clear that he was acrophobic.	He climbed when he was ready.
2 Were you aware that his brother was killed in a fall.

1 Soon as we ship it'll be "forgetta".	Don't mind him, Chucky.  You're talking to a guy whose idea of big romance is a palm full of Vaseline.
2 Screw you, Valentino.  I haven't seen you swapping spit with anybody.

1 Bobby Peru grab you now... Hold you tight... Feel everythin' in you now... Stay quiet... Say "fuck me" and then I'll leave.	No way... GET OUT!!!
2 Say it!... I'LL TEAR YOUR FUCKIN' HEART OUT, GIRL... Say "fuck me" soft - then I'll leave. Say "fuck me"... Whisper it... Then I'll leave... Say it... Say it - Say it - Say it...

1 How much money you have between the two a'ya right now?...	Forty bucks...
2 This is easy money, pardner... No ones gonna get hurt in this thing... And I don't think you can afford not to take it... I'll be bringin' the Eldo 'round the front of the motel at ten tomorrow mornin'... If you ain't a pussy - you'll be there.

1 Hey!!!... Johnnie Farragut. How are you, my man.	Real good, Chet... It's been awhile.
2 Everythin's relative. Where's that Marietta Pace Fortune? You two didn't split up, I hope.	No... She's fine. Back home.
3 What'll it be? The regular? Black Label?	Set one up.

1 Mr. San Pedro Sula's authorized to carry a .45.	United States Marine issue, before they made the unfortunate switch to the less dependable nine millimeters. I have it here, in my briefcase.

1 General Osvaldo Tamarindo y Ramirez. Telefono 666.	He is my sponsor. The General is the head of the secret police of Honduras.

1 Maybe I was there, but I didn't see anythin'. All I know's that trash killed a man with his bare hands. Hands which are now prob'ly all over my baby!	Marietta, settle down now darlin'... I want what's best for her, too - like I said, I'll do what I can to bring her home.

1 Nothin', honey.  Mama's just actin' strange.	You ain't actin', mama.
2 Why, Pace Roscoe Ripley, ain't you got one cute mouth tonight?

1 You're terrible crude sometimes, Sailor, you know?	I can't hardly understand you when you talk with one of them Mores in your mouth.

1 Sailor?	Yeah?
2 Wouldn't it be fabulous if we somehow stayed in love for the rest of our lives?	You think of the weirdest damn things to say sometimes, peanut. Ain't we been doin' a pretty fair job this far?
3 Oh, you know exactly what I mean, honey? It'd make the future so simple and nice.	At Pee Dee, all you think about is the future, you know? Gettin' out? And what you'll do and what you'll think about when you're on the outside again.
4 I just think about things as they come up. I never been much of a planner.	It ain't altogether terrible just to let things go along sometimes. Lula, I done a few things in my life I ain't too proud of, but I'll tell ya from now on I ain't gonna do nothin' for no good reason. All I know for sure is there's more'n a few bad ideas runnin' around loose out there.

1 Sorry, baby... When's the first time you done it with a girl who wasn't hookin'?	Maybe two, three months after Juarez. I was visitin' my cousin, Junior Train, in Savannah, and we were at some kid's house whose parents were out of town. A girl comes up to me that was real tall, taller than me.

1 Got you a pack of Mores again, huh?	Yeah, it's a real problem for me, Sailor, you know? When I went in that drugstore by the restaurant in Biloxi? I saw 'em by the register and the girl throw 'em in. I'm not big on resistin'. So what about a leech?
2 Heard on the radio how doctors is usin' leeches again, just in old times. You know, when even barbers used 'em?	I got one on me at Lake Lanier. Lifeguard poured salt on it and it dropped off. Felt awful. He was a cute boy, though, so it was almost worth it.

1 Sometimes dreams just don't mean nothin'... Stuff comes into your mind and you don't have no control over, you know? Anyways, dreams ain't no odder than real life. Sometimes not by half.	Well, I ain't upset about it, darlin'. Just give me an odd feelin' there a minute, is all.

1 I was just wastin' time, peanut, till you come back.	It's me who's wastin' time, Sailor, bein' with you.
2 Honey, I'm sorry. It wasn't nothin'. Come on and get up and we'll take off.	Leave me be for a minute? Mama gets all insane and then I see you practicin' your individuality and personal freedom with some oil-town tramp. How you figure I'm gonna feel?
3 Told you not to call your mama.

1 I can't take this, Sailor. She's dyin' right in front of our eyes...	I'm afraid she is, baby.

1 Sailor? You know what?	I know you ain't particularly pleased bein' here.
2 Not that. Look at what I wrote down cause I can't say it.

1 I'm sorry, Sailor. I just can't help it. Give me a minute and I'll quit.	Boys frightened, Lula. This ain't no good.
2 Really, Sail, I'll be okay.	It's a mistake, honey. You two go on. I'll walk back to the depot.
3 What're you talkin' about? That's your son in there.	He ain't never known me, Lula, so there ain't much for him to forget. Not seein' each other for six years makes it next best to simple for us, too.
4 How can you say that, Sailor?	What makes sense, is all.

1 I'm afraid his car is gone, Mrs. Fortune.	I don't understand this... I don't understand this one bit. He was supposed to meet me right her in this lobby. Somethin' bad has happened - I jus know it.
2 Perhaps we should call a local law enforcement officer.	HELL NO!!! That's the last thing we need... A buncha cops runnin' around.

1 Hey, Sailor boy, you wanna fuck Lula's mama?...	No.
2 Well, she wants to fuck you.

1 You snore.	So I hear.
2 No offense, Professor Tripp, but you look sorta crappy.	He's right, you look horrible.

1 Trip??	She left me. Crabs.
2 Left you...? Who? Emily?	This morning. I found a note in the kitchen.
3 But. ...why didn't you say something, Tripp? I mean, what are we doing here?

1 Shit.	Back up. Go out the other way.

1 Oh, Christ, don't start on ol' Gran or we'll leave you here.	Hey, I heard all about it -- the parents, the grandparents, the China town thing -- and I believe you, okay? That's why we're here. Now go get dressed.

1 Christ, Tripp. How did you know?	Call it a hunch.

1 I passed out.	You did.
2 I've been doing that a lot lately.	So I hear. You've also been smoking a lot of marijuana, I understand.
3 Do you think that's why I've been having these...  ...spells?	How long have you been having them?
4 The last month maybe.	How long have you been smoking marijuana?
5 Spiro T. Agnew was vice president, I believe.	That's probably not the problem, then. What about your lifestyle. Any major changes recently?
6 I've been trying to finish a book...	And your wife left you.
7 Is that in my chart?	I spoke with the woman who saved your life. You're lucky she came along when she did.

1 Right. Well, thanks. For the lift.	No sweat. Only do me a favor?
2 Sure.	Stop calling me Vernon.

1 You cold, James?	A little.
2 So what are you doing out here?	It's colder in there.
3 You're right.

1 Do you have a mirror? It's the best way to see if someone's breathing.	He's dead, James. Believe me, I know a dead dog when I see one.

1 I'm okay. I just lost my balance.	I put you on the floor.
2 Oh.	I thought you might -- I don't know -- swallow your tongue or something.  I guess you really miss her, huh?

1 I can't help myself. I don't know what's the matter with me.	Shit, James, you're hungover. What do you think's the matter with you?

1 Want one. They're incredible. Incredible.	Smoke the rest of that joint, James, and you can start on the box.

1 You're lying.	The hell I am.
2 Yes you are. My stuff stinks. I know it. You said so yourself.	I never said that.
3 Yes you did. Last night. To your friend Crabtree. "Is he any good?" he said. And you said: "Not yet he isn't." I heard you myself.	I didn't mean it that way.
4 It's okay, Professor Tripp. Carrie, Howard, the others -- they're right. My stories are annoying. They go on and on and on, and the longer they go on the more annoying they become, until finally you just want to grab something heavy and --	Shut up, James. You're annoying. Carrie and Howard don't know what the fuck they're talking about, okay? The entire class combined -- including the lovely Hannah Green -- has about one tenth of one percent the talent you have, okay?

1 Get out of here.	That's why she hates me. That's why she makes me sleep in the basement.
2 In the crawl space, with the rats and the casks of Amontillado. Come on. Up.

1 I've been re-reading Arsonist's Daughter. It's so beautiful, Grady. So natural. It's like all your sentences always existed, just waiting around in Style Heaven, or wherever, for you to fetch them down.	I thank you.
2 And I love the inscription you wrote to me. Only I'm not quite the downy innocent you think I am.	I hope that isn't true. We need all the downy innocents we can get.

1 He cribbed that from Borges.	It beats 'What's your major?'

1 Emily left me this morning.	She's left before...
2 She's left the room before. She always came back.

1 I can't believe you hung up on me, you dick.	Totally. I'm sorry. A lot was happening this morning. Can you talk?

1 This is not what the university has in mind when it promises a liberal education, Grady.	Would Walter really press charges?
2 It's within the realm. He takes his souvenirs pretty seriously. And he was just a wee bit prickly this morning.

1 That perfume you're wearing, Antonia. It wouldn't happen to be Cristaile, would it?	Why yes. How did you know?
2 Lucky guess.

1 Who's this ?	It's Grady, Walter.
2 Grady?	GRADY Tripp. English Department.
3 I know it's you, Grady, I just... Christ, Grady, do you know what time it is?	I have... eight-fifteen. That's not right, is it?
4 It's three-thirty, Grady.	This is important.
5 Oh?	I... I...
6 What is it, Grady?	I'm in love with your wife.
7 Excuse me?	Sara. I'm in love with her.

1 Holy shit. Are you serious?	As a heart attack.
2 Thanks -- Whoa, Professor Tripp, careful here...

1 Are you riding with me, James?	No, I'm going ho --

1 Living across the street from a grade school. Jesus.	Something wrong with that?
2 I was just thinking of... the noise.	I like the noise.

1 I've got some pictures.  Want to see?	No thanks.
2 Ah, come on.	I don't want to see any goddamn pictures.

1 They're starlings.	Is that right?
2 I don't like starlings.	Why not?
3 They're extremely aggressive birds. Plus, their habits are rather filthy.	The mother sure has her hands full.

1 What's up?	Have a seat.

1 This one guy on death row, who I'll call Henry, told me about his last victim. Henry says how he's in the bedroom of a seven-year-old cutie named Adele. Her mother's in the living room watching TV. She's got the volume on so damn high he can hear David Letterman's jokes. Henry puts his hand over Adele's mouth and says, "If you scream, little girl, I'll kill your mother." And of course little Adele doesn't scream, doesn't cry, doesn't make a sound. Then he takes her hand and out they go through the front door.  Ten days later they find Adele's body. Or what's left of it.  You believe in fairy tales?	Fairy tales?
2 Do you believe in them?	No.
3 Neither do I.  What's the one with the woodsman?	Woodsman?
4 The one with the ax?	I don't know.
5 Sure you do. He cuts open the wolf's stomach, and the girl steps out alive.	Little Red Riding Hood.
6 That's it. Little Red Riding Hood jumps out of the wolf's guts with hardly a scratch.  Ever see a seven-year-old girl sodomized almost in half?

1 I'd keep away from him.	What?
2 The new man. I'd keep away from him, if I were you.	Why's that?
3 You don't want to know, but he's damaged goods -- real damaged goods, if you know what I mean.	Yeah, Mary-Kay, I think I do. Thanks a bunch for the advice.

1 You said you couldn't make the sound of a solitary vireo. But you did. Beautifully. I heard you.	What will happen if I do?
2 Someone will talk to your daddy. And then he'll stop doing those things... the things you don't like.

1 How do you feel about that?	I don't feel anything.
2 You have no feelings for your niece?	She was born after they put me away. How can I have feelings?
3 Then why are you talking about this?	Have to talk about something.
4 What are you afraid will happen?	I'm not afraid. I'm just saying that Carlos has a thing for his daughter, and if he isn't careful he's going to suffer.
5 Have you talked to Carlos about your concerns?	I'm not that crazy.
6 Do you think you're crazy?	If I'm not, then what the hell am I doing here?
7 Why do you think you're here?	You know why. It's part of the parole deal.
8 Is that what you are angry about?	Talking to you is like riding on a merry-go-round.
9 That is a marvelous image, Walter. Because by going in circles we find the things we missed the first time around.

1 Who do you see?	I see my sister.

1 What?	Are you okay?
2 Yeah, I'm fucking fantastic.

1 Is that a school?	K through sixth.
2 Doesn't it get noisy?	I like the noise.
3 My place faces a truck street. I've got cracks in every window from the shaking.	You must hate it.
4 I go backpacking a lot. Lose myself in the wilderness for a week or two.

1 Did I say something wrong?	I suffer from insomnia.
2 Is that all?	When I do sleep, I sweat a lot. Usually I get nightmares and wake up screaming.
3 I sleep like a dead horse. Anything else?

1 You don't molest little girls anymore, do you?	No. Never again.

1 You're scared.	I'm not scared.
2 Neither am I.	Maybe you should be.

1 What's going on?	Nothing.

1 How you guys doing?	I'm alright, I'm dealing.

1 Okay, Jammer.  No problem.  You stay right here. I have to go there to the end... you'll see my lights.  We'll stay in voice contact.  Just hold onto the rope.  Five more minutes.  Okay?	Yeah, okay.  Okay.

1 What are you still wearing that for?	I don't know.  Divorce ain't final.  Forgot to take it off.

1 Jesus, Lindsey--	Bud, something really important is happening here.
2 Look.  I'm just trying to hold this situation together.  I can't allow you to cause this kind of hysteria--	Who's hysterical?  Nobody's hysterical!

1 You owe me one, Virgil.	Can we negotiate later?  There's Big Geek.

1 Okay... okay.  We gotta get you out of here.	How?
2 I don't know how!	We've only got one suit.
3 I know!  I know!  But we better come up with something.	Aaargh!!  I'm freezing!

1 We'll take reading as we go.  If the reactor's breached or the warheads have released radioactive debris, we'll back away.  Simple.	Okay... Hippy's not going... McWhirter, you can run Little Geek.

1 Come on, man.  What else could it be?	Why bring it here?
2 It's gotta be, like, an emergency plan to keep it away from the Russians... Hotwire one of the nukes with some kinda detonator, put it back in the sub, and fry the whole thing, slicker'n snot. Oh, uh... hi, Lins.

1 Cat, you tie onto this manifold.  There's some tanks on the other side; I'm gonna go check them out.	You watch yourself.

1 SHIT!	Give me that!!

1 Deepcore, Deepcore... this is Cab Three on final approach.	Gotcha, Cab Three.  Who is that?  That You, Lindsey?

1 Fluid breathing system.  We just got them.  We use it if we need to go really deep.	How deep?
2 Deep.  It's classified... you know.  Anyway, you breathe liquid, so you can't be compressed. Pressure doesn't get to you.

1 What kind of light?	He's hallucinating badly.

1 Did you sleep well?	Yes, fairly well. But I went to bed last night planning to do some thinking about a number of things ... instead, I fell asleep.
2 I didn't know one could sleep so well on a yacht. It lulls you ...

1 These people are contemptible. They have no sense of dignity at all.	And you say that came from Lisca Bianca?
2 It couldn't have come from anywhere else. At least, somewhere from that vicinity... But I really can't understand it. Contraband cigarettes on that island! It's the first time that ever happened.	Look... I'd like to get back to Lisca Bianca.
3 But how could we...at a time like this when we just... well, let's at least first have a look around the other islands. Could be that something might turn up there.	But even here we were supposed to find who knows what... And all we bring back with us is a crate of cigarettes.
4 As you wish.

1 There's nothing much to laugh at.	And that's what I say, too. We could have all been killed.

1 Where are you going?... To Montaldo's?	Yes.
2 Then I'll go with you.

1 Really, I've got to stop this business with Ettore... I would like to go back and start working on my own projects again. You know, I had many ideas...	And why did you drop them?
2 Once they gave me a job to draw up an estimate for the construction of a school. It took me only a day and a half to finish it, and I got paid six million lire. Ever since then I've been doing estimates for other people's designs.

1 What are you saying?	I was only joking, really... Can't I make a joke? And now you've got to tell me why you don't want to.
2 Oh, Sandro... I want everything you do. But...

1 I'm going with the patrol boat to make a tour around the islands.	To do what?
2 I just can't leave without first searching those islands, one by one.	But aren't you tired? I can just about manage to stand on my feet!  Raimondo!

1 Who are you talking to?	To the shark.

1 I'll stay here also.	But why?... What if it starts to rain?
2 If it rains, I'll buy myself an umbrella.

1 And who is this?	This is Claudia, Anna's friend...  You've never met my husband, have you?

1 Don't you ever paint men?	Answer me, why don't you try posing? I'll paint you a beautiful portrait.
2 But why me?... Ask Claudia, she's much more beautiful than me.	But I want to paint you. You appeal to me more.
3 I appeal to you more?

1 Are you the owner of this place?	No. The owners are in Australia.
2 But where did you come from?	From Panarea. Why?

1 Raimondo... Do you enjoy fishing underwater?	I detest it. But, after all, what can you do... It's the latest...and I try my best to adapt myself.

1 Because I'm getting fat.	Oh, for Heaven's sake.
2 I am, there's too much flesh on me.	Agnes...
3 I'm a blimp.	Why does it matter whether you're fat or not...
4 Because...	... You needn't worry about being attractive here.
5 I do, I have to be attractive to God.	He loves you the way you are.
6 No he doesn't. He hates fat people.	Who told you this?
7 It's a sin to be fat.	Why?
8 Look at the statues, they're thin.	Agnes...
9 That's because they're suffering... suffering is beautiful, I want to be beautiful.	Who tells you these things?
10 Christ said it in the Bible, he said - suffer the little children, I want to suffer like a little child.	That's not what he meant.
11 I... I am a little child but my body keeps getting bigger and soon I... I won't be able to fit in, I... I won't be able to squeeze into Heaven.	Agnes dear, Heaven is not a place where...

1 You want to talk about the baby don't you?	Would you like to talk about it?
2 I never saw any baby... I think they made it up.	Why should they?
3 I don't know.	Do you remember the night they said it came?
4 No. I was sick.	How were you sick?
5 Something I ate.	Did it hurt?
6 Yes.	Where?
7 Down... there.	And what did you do?
8 I went to my room.	And what happened?
9 I got sicker.	And then what?
10 I fell asleep.	In the middle of all the pain?
11 Yes.	Where did the baby come from?
12 What baby?	The baby they made up.
13 From their heads...	Is that where they say it came from... ?
14 No, they say it came from the waste paper basket!	Where'd it come from before that?
15 From God.	After God... before the waste-paper basket.
16 I... I don't understand.	Agnes, how are babies born?
17 Don't you know?	Yes I do,  but I want you to...
18 I don't understand what you're talking about... you want to talk about the baby... everybody wants to talk about the baby but... I never saw the baby so I can't talk about the baby because... I don't believe in the baby.	Then let's talk about something else...
19 No... no, I'm tired of talking, I've been talking for weeks, nobody believes me when I tell them anything... nobody listens to me.	Agnes...
20 No... no, I don't want to answer any more questions.	Would you like to ask them?
21 What do you mean?	Just that... you ask and I'll answer.
22 Anything?	Anything.

1 Agnes, I'm here because I want to help you.	I'm not sick.
2 But you're troubled... aren't you?	That's because you keep reminding me. If you go away then I'll forget.
3 And you're unhappy.	Everyone's unhappy, you're unhappy aren't you?
4 Agnes...	Answer me!  You never answer me.
5 Sometimes, yes.	Only you think you're lucky because you didn't have a mother who said things to you and did things to you that maybe weren't always nice but that was because of me, because I was bad, not her.

1 Which one?	I don't know which one 
2 Of what?	Of me. Oh... God!  My God...  Water... it's all water...
3 Why isn't anyone coming?	They can't hear me that's why.  Oh God... I don't wanna...

1 It was dead.	It was alive wasn't it?
2 I don't remember.

1 Martha, it's you.	What about Roger? He's free.

1 I'm afraid the word brings up the most unpleasant connatations in this day and age...	Yes... I...
2 You can call me Sister.	... Thank you.
3 You must have tons of questions. You may smoke if you want to. Just don't tell any of the Sisters.

1 It's my affair too.	How dare you think I'm in a position to be pressured...

1 And my permission?	I'd like yours too.

1 Stop this, she'll hurt herself  I'm not going to allow this.	NO... no... I said leave her alone.

1 They're yours.	They are?
2 The cards... you're bank.

1 Sure.	And hurry, they're not looking too happy.

1 Are you going in?	No, she'll only reject me in the end and I'll be frustrated.
2 You never know, you might be lucky this time.	No, I know the psychological pattern and it plays hell with me drum skins.

1 Aye and we'll have to watch it and all.	I suggest you just give him the photos and have done with it.

1 Oh, Paul, you can't have your own way!!!	If I let you have your own way, you little rascal, will you respect me?

1 Hello, he's not talking to me. He's having a sulk.	Well, it must be catching. He's given it to the champ here.

1 Will you ever look at him, sitting there wid his hooter scraping away at that book!	Well ... what's the matter with that?
2 Have you no natural resources of your own? Have they even robbed you of that?	You can learn from books.
3 Can you now? Aah ... sheeps' heads! You learn more by getting out there and living.	Out where?
4 Any old where ... but not our little Richard ... oh no! When you're not thumping them pagan skins, you're tormenting your eyes wid that rubbish!	Books are good!
5 Parading's better!	Parading?
6 That's it, parading the streets ... trailing your coat ... bowling along ... living!	Well, I <U>am</U> living, aren't I?
7 You're living, are you? When was the last time you gave a girl a pink-edged daisy? When did you last embarrass a sheila wid your cool appraising stare?	Eh ... you're a bit old for that sort of chat, aren't you?
8 At least I've a backlog of memories, but all you've got is that book!	Aaah ... stop picking on me... you're as bad as the rest of them.
9 So you <U>are</U> a man after all.	What's that mean?
10 Do you think I haven't noticed ... do you think I wasn't aware of the drift? Oh ... you poor unfortunate scuff, they've driven you into books by their cruel, unnatural treatment, exploiting your good nature.	Oh ... I dunno.
11 And that lot's never happier than when they're jeering at you ... and where would they be without the steady support of your drum beat, I'd like to know.	Yeah ... that's right.
12 And what's it all come to in the end?	Yeah ... what's in it for me?
13 A book!	Yeah ... a bloomin' book!

1 Come on let's get this coffee.	Before you go, I think it's only fair to warn you about me Grandson ... don't let our Paul have his own way all the time, 'cos if you do he won't respect you!

1 And another thing, where's that old mixer?	Here, Pauly.

1 Aye, that's what I'm afraid of!	He's got you worried, then?
2 Him, he costs you a fortune in breach of promise cases. He's a villain and a right mixer as well.

1 What's he know?	Nothing, he's trying to brainwash me and give me personality doubts ... oh, he's a swine but a clever swine, mind.

1 I'll brook no denial!	It's all right for you, you couldn't get a pen in your foot, you swine.
2 Come on, Shake, we'll leave 'em to their penmanship.

1 Control yourself or you'll spurt. He's bound to be somewhere.	Aye, let's try the dressing room.

1 And?	Your Grandfather pointed out Shake was always being taller than me just to spite me.
2 I knew it, <U>he</U> started it, I should have known.	Y'what?
3 You two have never had a quarrel in your life and in two minutes flat he's got you at it. He's a king mixer. Adam and Eve, meet the serpent. Anthony and Cleopatra, there's your asp. Divide and Conquer, that's this one's motto. He hates group unity so he gets everyone at it.

1 Stop picking on him.	I don't need you to defend me, y'know, Norm.

1 How's that?	Oh ... he's nursing a broken heart.

1 So you just brought the old chap out of the crowd for his own good.	Yeah, but he insisted on us bringing him to the station.
2 Well, he can't stop here.

1 Where's Irth?	Sandy, scan the whole sky.

1 I'm sending.  Do you hear me?	Receiving.

1 Okay, I'm in the mouth of the chimney now, and I'm starting down.	Take care.

1 Just <u>hold it</u>, <u>hold it</u>!  Computer: have you attempted to analyze the transmission?	Yes.  There are two points of salient interest.  Number one: it is highly systematized, indicating intelligent origin.  Number two: certain sounds are inconsistent with the human palate.

1 Yes?  What is it?	Jay, we've got a problem.  I was wondering if there was any way you could shortcut the repairs and give us immediate takeoff capability.
2 Why, what's wrong?	The computer's translated the alien signal, and it's kind of alarming.
3 What do you mean?	It couldn't translate the whole thing, only three phrases.  I'll just read it to you the way I got it:  "... HOSTILE... SURVIVAL... ADVISE DO NOT LAND... "  And that's all it could translate.

1 Oh -- God -- oh --	Is it alive?

1 This dust is getting clogged in the intakes again!	Just hold us together till we're in space, that's all!

1 He wouldn't open the lock; he was going to leave us out there.	Yeah... well, maybe he should have.  I mean, you brought the goddamn thing in here.  Maybe <u>you</u> deserve to get slapped.

1 That thing, God almighty, didn't you try to get it off him?	It wouldn't come.

1 Maybe we don't have to.  It's trapped in there.  We could just leave it in there all the way back to Irth.	Don't be an idiot.

1 It will be.	What we really need is some red meat in here for bait.

1 Look at that.	What is it -- I can't tell anything --
2 It's some kind of organ -- it's inserted some kind of tube or something down his throat.	Oh... God...

1 We can't kill it on board.  It's huge now and must have tremendous amounts of that acid in its body.	I've got an idea, but you're not going to like it.

1 Well, we can't go anywhere in this darkness.  How long till dawn?	Well... this rock rotates every two hours.  The sun should be coming up in about 20 minutes.

1 If we don't hear from him soon, I think we better go in after him.	Sun will be down in a minute.

1 Too primitive.  It's a pre- technological construction.  That slab was engineered by an Iron-Age culture at best.	They're from a dead civilization; they're spores from a tomb.  God knows how long they've been here.

1 My God, it's stormy for a piece of rock that size!	Just a second.  Those aren't water vapor clouds; they have no moisture content.

1 Oh my God.	Well, it's finally happened.

1 What would you say that was supposed to mean?	Well... it's obviously intentional... some kind of attempt at communication... maybe it's a symbol that means something to them...
2 But why draw it on the wall?

1 Where did the parasites come from?	They seem native to the planet.  It's got an atmosphere and a dense gravity.  It's dead now, but once it must have been fertile.

1 Hey, wait a minute!  That's all our food supplies in there!  We can't pump poison gas all over them!	Once we kill the thing we won't need the food any more -- we can go straight into hypersleep.  Also, it sounds like that thing is already doing a pretty good job on our supplies; it may be fouling them all.
2 You win.

1 This is all the same creature.  We're seeing the different stages in its life-cycle.	Then that tomb... must have been some kind of fertility temple... where they stored their eggs, and maybe held mating rituals...

1 So what do we do?  Do we ignore it and finish loading the explosives into the boat -- or do we flush it out now?	Now.  If we can get it into the boat, we won't have to blow it up -- we can just eject it into space.

1 Nada. No radiation... no movement... nothing.	Well, just keep looking.  It's gotta be... whoa, Jesus!

1 Can you patch me a temporary loop on DCMGS?	Okay, give me the numbers.

1 Fucking great.  I invested some money in them.	You win some, you loose some.
2 I lose 'em all, that's why I'm still out here on this rock.  Anything else you wanna ruin my day with?	No, but I got something that might interest you.

1 How much air-time have I got?	About thirty minutes.  Those are slimmed-down tanks, so no stopping to admire the scenery.
2 Deal.	We've dumped the whole data-base from one of the cleaning remotes into the helmet. It'll project the route through the sewer system onto the inside of the glass as you go.

1 What?  Are you nuts?  Just the two of us?	I've seen this mother, De Vries.  We can bag it, no problem.
2 Forget it, man.	C'mon De Vries.  Think of the bonus.
3 Fuck the bonus.  I hate heights.  You wouldn't get me up there even if it wasn't night.

1 Oh, man.  That's no glitch!	It's alright, it's cool...
2 Is it still moving?	No, he's stopped; he's totally still. Just take it nice and easy, babe. Nice and easy...

1 We had to.  They were just too cumbersome for some of the conduits you're gonna have to negotiate.  Besides, all the crap floating around reduces visibility to the extent where I doubt having helmet lights would have make that much difference, anyway.  Maintenance lights down there oughta be enough to do the trick.	How tight are these shafts?

1 They knocked out the external feeds.	Looks like it.

1 I've got a lot of thinking to do.  'Sides, the room was getting too crowded for me.	Not too much of the socializing type, then?
2 No, not really.  More sort of the  'claustrophobic' type.

1 Do you believe him?	Ackland?  I don't know him well enough to say.  If we were back on Earth we could run him though an Aldhoven test and find out for sure. There's not much we can do out here.

1 Today's party's finished their sweep, the relief team's out there now. Everybody else is either asleep or running shift in the auto-shop.	You should hit the sack, too.
2 Nah, I'll stick it out for another hour or so.	What time's sundown?
3 'Bout five minutes.	Give me a yell is something happens.
4 You got it, cowboy.

1 What a day - what a heavenly day...	D-day.
2 Just like it.	And tomorrow morning you will have won your beachhead on the shores of Immortality...
3 Stop rehearsing your column... Isn't it strange, Addison? I thought I'd be panic-stricken, want to run away or something. Instead, I can't wait for tonight to come. To come and go...	Are you that sure of tomorrow?
4 Aren't you?	Frankly - yes.

1 What do you take me for?	I don't know what I take you for anything...
2 It is possible - even conceivable - that you've confused me with that gang of backward children you've been playing tricks on - that you have the same contempt for me that you have for them?	I'm sure you mean something by that, Addison, but I don't know what...
3 Look closely, Eve, it's time you did. I am Addison deWitt. I'm nobody's fool. Least of all - yours.	I never intended you to be.
4 Yes, you did. You still do.

1 I don't suppose there's a drink left...	You can have one at Max's.
2 I don't think I'm going.	Why not?
3 Because I don't want to.	Max has gone to a great deal of trouble, it's going to be an elaborate party, and it's for you.
4 No, it's not.  It's for this.	It's the same thing, isn't it?
5 Exactly.  Here. Take it to the party instead of me.	You're being childish.

1 It is senseless to insist that theatrical folk in New York, Hollywood and London are no different from the good people of Des Moines, Chillicothe and Liverpool. By and large, we are concentrated gatherings of neurotics, egomaniacs, emotional misfits, and precocious children-	Gable. Why a feller like that don't come East to do a play...

1 Why so remote, Addison? I should think you'd be at the side of your protegee, lending her moral support...	Miss Caswell, at the moment, is where I can lend no support - moral or otherwise.
2 The ladies' - shall we say - lounge?	Being violently ill to her tummy.
3 It's good luck before an audition. She'll be all right once it starts.

1 I guess at this point I'm what the French call 'de trop'...	Maybe just a little around the edges.

1 Knit me a muffler.	Call me when you get in...

1 I can't believe you're making this up - it sounds like something out of an old Clyde Fitch play...	Clyde Fitch, thought you may not think so, was well before my time!
2 I've always denied the legend that you were in 'Our American Cousin' the night Lincoln was shot...	I don't think that's funny!
3 Of course it's funny - this is all too laughable to be anything else. You know what I think about this - this age obsession of yours - and now this ridiculous attempt to whip yourself up into a jealous froth because I spent ten minutes with a stage-struck kid-	Twenty minutes!
4 Thirty minutes, forty minutes! What of it?	Stage-struck kid... she's a young lady - of qualities. And I'll have you know I'm fed up with both the young lady and her qualities! Studying me as if - as if I were a play or a set of blueprints! How I walk, talk, think, eat, sleep!
5 Now how can you take offense at a kid trying in every way to be as much like her ideal as possible!	Stop calling her a kid! It so happens there are particular aspects of my life to which I would like to maintain sole and exclusive rights and privileges!
6 For instance what?	For instance - you!
7 This is my cue to take you in my arms and reassure you - but I'm not going to. I'm too mad-	- guilty.
8 Mad! Darling, there are certain characteristics for which you are famous - on stage and off. I love you for some of them - and in spite of others. I haven't let those become too important to me. They're part of your equipment for getting along in what is laughably called out environment - you've got to keep your teeth sharp. All right. But you will not sharpen them on me - or on Eve...	What about her teeth? What about her fangs?
9 She hasn't cut them yet, and you know it! So when you start judging an idealistic dreamy-eyed kid by the barroom, Benzedrine standards of this megalomaniac society - I won't have it! Eve Harrington has never by word, look, thought or suggestion indicated anything to me but her adoration for you and her happiness at our being in love! And to intimate anything else doesn't spell jealousy to me - it spells a paranoic insecurity that you should be ashamed of!	Cut! Print it! What happens in the next reel? Do I get dragged off screaming to the snake pit?

1 Bill...  ... where are you going? To find Eve?	That suddenly makes the whole thing believable.

1 Hello, what's your name?	Eve. Eve Harrington.

1 Lemme fix you a drink.	No thanks, Birdie.

1 She, too, is a great admirer of yours.	Imagine. All this admiration in just one room.

1 You're going to Hollywood - aren't you?  From the trunks you're packing, you must be going to stay a long time.	I might.
2 That spilled drink is going to ruin your carper.

1 If I only knew how...	Try...
2 Well...

1 Karen...  ... you won't forget, will you? What we talked about before?	No, Eve, I won't forget...

1 Addison wants me to play it.	Over my dead body...
2 That won't be necessary. Addison knows how Margo happen to miss that performance - how I happened to know she'd miss it in time to call him and notify every paper in town...  ... it's quite a story. Addison could make quite a thing of it - imagine how snide and vicious he could get and still write nothing but the truth. I had a time persuading him...  ... you'd better sit down. You look a bit wobbly.  If I play "Cora," Addison will never tell what happened - in or out of print. A simple exchange of favors. And I'm so happy I can do something for you - at long last...  Your friendship with Margo - your deep, close friendship - what would happen to it, do you think, if she knew the chap trick you'd played on her - for my benefit? And you and Lloyd - how long, even in the Theater, before people forgot what happened - and trusted you again?  No... it would be so much easier on everyone concerned, if I were to play "Cora." And so much better theater, too...

1 Back to Copacabana. But Eve. Margo, let me tell you about Eve-	I was dreadful, Miss Channing, believe me - I have no right to be anyone's understudy, much less yours...

1 Well - what do you think of my elegant new suit?	Very becoming. It looks better on you than it did on me.
2 I can imagine... you know, all it needed was some taking in here and letting out there - are you sure you won't want it yourself?	Quite sure. I find it just a bit too - too "Seventeenish" for me...
3 Oh, come now, as though you were an old lady... I'm on my way. Is there anything more you've thought of-?	There's the script to go back to the Guild-
4 I've got it.	- and those checks or whatever it is for the income tax man.
5 Right here.	It seems I can't think of a thing you haven't thought of...
6 That's my job.  See you at tea time...	Eve...  ... by any chance, did you place a call from me to Bill for midnight California time?
7 Oh, golly. And I forgot to tell you-	Yes, dear. You forgot all about it.
8 Well, I was sure you'd want to, of course, being his birthday, and you've been so busy these past few days, and last night I meant to tell you before you went out with the Richards - and I guess I was asleep when you got home...	Yes, I guess you were. It - it was very thoughtful of you, Eve.
9 Mr. Sampson's birthday. I certainly wouldn't forget that. You'd never forgive me.  As a matter of fact, I sent him a telegram myself...

1 Relax, kid. It's only me and my big mouth...	It's just that you get me so mad sometimes... of all the women in the world with nothing to complain about-
2 Ain't it the truth?	Yes, it is! You're talented, famous, wealthy - people waiting around night after night just to see you, even in the wind and rain...
3 Autograph fiends! They're not people - those little beast who run in packs like coyotes-	They're your fans, your audience-
4 They're nobody's fans! They're juvenile delinquents, mental detectives, they're nobody's audience, they never see a play or a movie, even - they're never indoors long enough!

1 Karen.  I haven't been pleasant this weekend.	We've all seemed a little tense lately...
2 Come to think of it, I haven't been very pleasant for weeks. For that, I'm truly sorry. More than any two people I know, I don't want you and Lloyd to be angry with me...	We're never deeply angry, we just get sore. The way you do. We know you too well...
3 So many people - know me. I wish I did. I wish someone would tell be about me...	You're Margo. Just - Margo.
4 And what is that? Besides something spelled out in light bulbs, I mean. Besides something called temperament, which consists mostly of swooping about on a broomstick creaming at the top of my voice... infants behave the way I do, you know. They carry on and misbehave - they'd get drunk if they knew how - when they can't have what they want. When they feel unwanted and insecure - or unloved.

1 How was the concert?	Loud.

1 You'll break your neck on that ice.	What a way to die - trying to get an actress to the theater in time. Tell Max I want to be buried with royalties...
2 Don't joke about such things.

1 After all, maybe she just wants to apologize...	I have no possible interest in anything she'd have to say.

1 I like that girl. That quality of quiet graciousness...	... Among so many quiet qualities.

1 Karen and I just don't want an accident-	I have no intention of having an accident!
2 It's not important whether you do. We are wearing long underwear.

1 Make it Bergdorf Goodman... and now everything is on its proper shelf, eh, Max? Done up in little ribbons. I could die right now and nobody'd be confused. How about you, Max?	How about me what?

1 Carl?	Yeah?
2 Fuck you, Carl.

1 See her?  Get anything?	For the paper, no; for us, plenty.  I waited a long time and finally this big guy--I guess a bodyguard-- he left and I knocked and she remembered me, we talked awhile.
2 And?--And?--	--she was panicked, Carl--every time I mentioned Watergate, you could tell.
3 Were you eyebrow reading?	It was there. I just don't get it; a CREEP secretary being scared, that's one thing. But what does the wife of one of the most powerful men in America have to be afraid of...?

1 How do you want to handle Sloan?	You mean, who's going to play the mean M.P. and who's going to be the nice one?  Whichever.
2 He's another Ivy Leaguer so he'll probably expect you to be understanding--might surprise him if you're not.	You want me to be the bastard.
3 And I'll just shitkick in my usual way.

1 You think we're being set up?--Christ, Deep Throat tells you last night that the letter came from inside the White House and up traipses Marilyn naming names.	It makes a crazy kind of sense-- remember that initiation rite they have at the White House? Each new member of the President's staff has to prove his guts by getting an enemy of Nixon.
2 You think this was Clawsen's initiation?	Could have won him a fraternity paddle with a White House seal.  God knows it worked.

1 I finally got through to Sloan--it was all a misunderstanding that we had: he would have told the Grand Jury about Haldeman, he was ready to, only nobody on the Grand Jury asked him the goddamn question.	So I guess you could say that we screwed up, but we weren't wrong.

1 Donald Segretti?	That's right.

1 Speak.	We've just been talking to Young--

1 Hey... very tense.	Lot of pressure at the Star.  Carl, when we got married, you were four thousand dollars in debt; when we split, you were solvent. That may prove to be the outstanding single achievement of my life, and now look at this.  How much did the damn bike cost?
2 Five hundred; six maybe.	You're two months behind--you got enough to cover?
3 I think.	Give me your checkbook then.
4 It's right under that pile.

1 Why couldn't you have just dialed me from the office, Irwin?	'Cause I'm not calling out from the phone company anymore--  --I think the place is bugged.
2 So tell me about the Times article.	What do you want to know?
3 No games, Irwin; give.	My big civil rights buddy--  --boy, if John Mitchell was after your phone records, would you be screaming.  What're you onto?
4 Something maybe big.	And that makes anything you do OK, is that it?
5 Just tell me about the goddamn article.	It was accurate, but I can't get a fuller listing for you--all Barker's phone records have been subpoenaed.
6 Who by?	A Miami D.A. The guy doing the investigating is named Martin Dardis. 
7 Irwin? I really feel bad, doing something like this--you know that, don't you?

1 --if we wrote a story that said Haldeman controlled the fund?--	--let me put it this way: I'd have no problem if you did.

1 Just tell me his title.	I don't know titles.
2 Is he on the level of Assistant to the President or not?

1 What I don't understand is how you got here.	I assure you, there's nothing mysterious involved.
2 Probably you're right, but a little while ago, I was talking to a couple of lawyers who'd been assigned to represent the burglars.	So?
3 Well, they never would have been assigned if anyone had known the burglars had arranged for their own counsel. And that could only mean the burglars didn't arrange for their own counsel--they never even made a phone call.  So if they didn't ask for you to be here, how did you know to come?

1 Why did they do all this for Chrissakes?--what were they after?	Total manipulation. I suppose you could say they wanted to subvert the Constitution, but they don't think along philosophical lines.
2 Talk about Segretti--	--don't concentrate on Segretti or you'll miss the overall scheme too.
3 There were more then.	Follow every lead--every lead goes somewhere--
4 --the Canuck letter--was that a White House operation--	--don't you miss the grand scheme too.
5 How grand?	Nationwide--my God, they were frightened of Muskie and look who got destroyed--they wanted to run against McGovern, and look who they're running against. They bugged, they followed people, false press leaks, fake letters, they canceled Democratic campaign rallies, they investigated Democratic private lives, they planted spies, stole documents, on and on-- don't tell me you think this was all the work of little Don Segretti.
6 And Justice and FBI know all this?	Yes, yes, everything. There were over fifty people employed by the White House and CREEP to ratfuck-- some of what they did is beyond belief.
7 Fifty ratfuckers directed by the White House to destroy the Democrats?	I was being cautious.  You can safely say more then fifty...

1 Where's that cheery face we've come to know and love?	You call me in on my day off because some idiots have broken into local Democratic Headquarters--tell me, Harry, why should I be smiling?
2 As usual, that keen mind of yours has pegged the situation perfectly.  Except  it wasn't local Democratic Headquarters, it was National Democratic Headquarters--  --and  these weren't just any idiots, these were special idiots, seeing as when they were arrested at 2:30 this morning, they were all wearing business suits and Playtex gloves and were carrying--  --a walkie-talkie, forty rolls of film, cameras, lock picks, pen-sized tear gas guns, plus various bugging devices.  Not to mention over two thousand dollars, mostly in sequenced hundred dollar bills.	Preliminary hearing at Superior Courthouse?
3 Two o'clock, work the phones 'til you go.

1 I can predict the next words you're gonna say: "anyone but Bernstein."  I want to send a reporter to Miami.	Anyone but Bernstein.
2 Howard--	--remember Toronto, Harry.
3 That was awhile ago.	I don't get it--you were the one who wanted to fire him.
4 I know, I did, but damnit Howard--  For the first time since I've known him, I think he's really humping...

1 --and he says Chapin hired Segretti--	--well and good, but when will he say it on the record.
2 He just did.

1 Hi. I'm Bob Woodward of the Washington Post and I hate to bother you at home--	--I already get the Post. I don't need another subscription.
2 No, I'm a reporter. I wanted to talk to you about the Committee to Re- Elect.	The what to what?
3 You work there, Miss Abbott.	I'm not Miss Abbott.

1 Perhaps you should consider actually answering an ad.	Finch, you can be the one to date a nearly-dead insane chick.  Eat your damn imitation hot dog.
2 This is no imitation.  Removing the hot dog from the Ultradog yields a better dog.  Behold -- Ultradog, no dog.

1 This.  Right now.	Uh-huh.

1 Hey, what're you doing here?	Just enjoying my exhilarating first lacrosse experience.  You like, "kicked butt."

1 ...I've got this lacrosse game.  It's really important, it's our last game. And you know, Central almost beat us last time, so I really want to kick their ass, and it's like cool because we're gonna get to play at State, which means that after the game I might be able to stop by...	You can't sing at the competition.
2 I'm sorry, I totally spaced.  I just...I didn't realize it...	...it's okay, you should do whatever makes you happy.
3 Alright...yeah...thanks for understanding.  So I guess...I'll see you later.

1 Ah, you'll get her back soon enough. That's easy, she likes you.  What you need to do is learn to press a girl's buttons.  You gotta give her what she's never had.	What?
2 I'll give you a hint.  "Ohhh, yeah, yeah!"  Comprende?	You mean...and orgasm?
3 You got it, stud.	Well...I'm pretty sure I've --
4 No you haven't.	But that one time --
5 No.	Well of course I'd want to give her that.  I mean, what do you think, I don't care about her?
6 Do you?	Of course.
7 Do you love her?

1 Unlisted age, plus "youthful mind," equals old.	No, "Charming" is old.  "Older" is <u>really</u> old.  "Youthful mind" is dead.

1 Hey, where's Finch?	Went home to shit.
2 I don't get it.  How does a guy like that get this sudden reputation?

1 Yeeeeeeeaaaawwwwww!	You fuckin' rule!

1 Jim?	It's not what it looks like!

1 ...excuse me?!	What, you think I don't know how to get myself off?  Hell, that's what half of band camp is!  Sex ed!

1 Hey, you did better than I did, Nova.	Oh that's really reassuring.  And don't call me Nova anymore.  I'm a fraud.

1 Yes.	I thought so.

1 Jim...	Oh no.

1 Oh, Kev.	Vicky -- do you think, maybe...it's time for us to take the next step in our relationship?
2 Tonight?	Yeah, it's such a perfect evening. Isn't this how you've always pictured it?

1 Kevin?  Do you not love me?	No, I don't not love you.  I like, I know that we've definitely got <u>something</u> between us.  Something good. Something special.
2 But you don't love me.	I didn't say that.  I mean, love, it's like a term that gets thrown around. People say things, they get married, have kids, and then what?  It's like they call it off, going "I was wrong."

1 Yeah Vick?	I want to hear you say it.
2 Okay.

1 Then she said -- she loves me.	Oh shit dude, the L-word!

1 So does your tongue cramp up?	Nah, you get kind of dizzy though.

1 NOVA!!	Stifler!!

1 Here, babe.	Thanks.

1 Merde! I can't believe this!	You try to be a good sport, and look what happens.

1 Okay... dead or undead... what do you want from me?	A-duh... You're a werewolf. And we, as your victims, have to walk the earth until your curse is lifted.
2 Uh huh... And, supposing I believed that, what could I do about it?

1 I'm serious. There's nothing for you down there. It's dangerous.	Come on. I'm from New York - the "shoot me" state. Don't wait up.

1 What about food? Even beautiful women have to eat. It's true. I read it. Please? A half an hour?  My treat?  Pleez! Don't make go out there alone again! I'm begging you!	Okay. But I'm back in half an hour.

1 You two faced bastard. I knew you were full of shit.	Andy! No!

1 Andy?... What? What is it?  Andy... are you okay?	It was you... That night in the tunnels. You. You did this to me.
2 No I.... Andy, you can't be sure.	That's the scar where I stabbed you! Oh God... You deliberately took me down there so you could... God, I can't believe it!

1 Whoa...	After the revolution, the Paris cemeteries overflowed. They dug up all the old bodies and brought them here. Seven million people. Mostly very poor.
2 Pretty stylish digs for a bunch of paupers.	Well, they are French.
3 Right.

1 In Paris we have an expression for people like you: Encul d'Americain.	Yeah? In New York we got an expression too. Goes like this...

1 You bastard! God! I should've known. You wanted the cure all for yourself!	Cure!? Ha-ha-ha!

1 Psychic awareness. Right.	You think it's silly. But do you realize that young man is actually in a deep sleep?
2 What?	He's on a new drug called ZBH, or "Daydream". It allows the user to be fully alert and mobile while he's dreaming. He is literally conscious and unconscious at the same time.
3 Yeah well, that's like really groovy and everything, but who hacked my uncle's legs off?

1 All my life I've worked to unlock the power of the unconscious mind. Well this is it. This is power!	You sure it's not just 'coz you jerk off too much?

1 Maybe we should go now. You must be very tired. We'll call if any new -	I can't believe this. Why don't you go down in the tunnels and find the goddamn... animals that attacked my uncle?
2 Andy, it's not so easy. There are hundreds of kilometers of tunnels under Paris. It's a whole other city, crawling with drug addicts, lunatics, skinheads... It's no man's land.

1 Andy, stop! I think he can help you - 	Allo?

1 Saint Severin...	You never heard the story of Saint Severin driving the werewolves from Paris?
2 You think that's what McDermott was raving about in the ambulance?	What, you think everyone's as ignorant as you?

1 Providing travel papers is illeagal!  I know Dmitri well - perhaps I can help you.  Providded you have enough money to pay for this service. . .	Well, I don't have any money . . .
2 Good day!

1 Ouch!  That really hurt!	I'm sorry. . .  I'm. . .
2 That's quite a hard head you've got there, boy.

1 Forged papers! Now, what?!	Now just get off the train.
2 HUH?!

1 Nervous?	Yes - If I can't convince Sophie, I'll never be able to see Tatiana....
2 You'll convince her. You have the qualities of a princess you're poised and strong... and beautiful ... even if you forget a couple dates of family names - she'll know.

1 Anastasia! It was just a bat! It's gone, dear...	No, it wasn't a bat! I saw this horrible man - I remember him, I think...
2 No, no child... shush... it's all right ...

1 Hey, she's just a kid. And she's going to Paris outta sight, outta mind, outta Russia.	I cursed then all!
2 My Aunt Bella, sweet woman not the brightest bat in the world - she used to hang right side up, anyway she always said "Curses were made to be broken". Course, she said it in those irritating little bat squeaks, so it wasn't quite so profound...

1 She doesn't want to do anything "dishonest". . .	Ew. . .  the honest type.

1 Life is funny, isn't it. You find the right girl ... and then you lose her.	What do you mean?
2 Dmitri ... You must understand that once you take her to Tatiana... well, it's over... nothing can happen between you. She's a princess and you're a commoner.

1 Empress, no! I will not take the money! I just came to tell you I was sorry...	Young man, I...

1 Who's on television?	This guy, on the Johnny Carson show.

1 H'm, I'm sorry, I can't go through with this, because it-I can't get it off my mind, Allison... it's obsessing me!	Well, I'm getting tired of it. I need your attention.

1 Stop it, Alvy!	Well, he's spitting on my neck! You know, he's spitting on my neck when he talks.

1 So, so-well, here's what I wanna know. W-what...  Am I your first big romance?	Oh... no, no, no, no, uh, uh. No.
2 Well, then, w-who was?	Oh, well, let's see, there was Dennis, from Chippewa Falls High School.

1 All right.	I'll getcha a piece.
2 Yeah... so, listen-you drive?	Do I drive? Uh, no, I gotta-I gotta problem with driving.
3 Oh, you do?	Yeah. I got, uh, I got a license but I have too much hostility.
4 Oh, right.	Nice car.
5 Huh?	You keep it nice.  Can I ask you, is this-is this a sandwich?
6 Huh? Oh, yeah.

1 Well, I don't know. I mean, I guess- I guess you must be sorta late, huh?	You know, I gotta get there and begin whining soon... otherwise I- Hey... well, are you busy Friday night?
2 Me? Oh, uh.  No.	Oh, I'm sorry, wait a minute, I have something. Well, what about Saturday night?
3 Oh... nothing. Not-no, no!	Oh, you... you're very popular, I can see.
4 I know.	Gee, boy, what do you have? You have plague?
5 Well, I mean, I meet a lot of... jerks, you know-	Yeah, I meet a lotta jerks, too.
6 what I mean?	think that's, uh-
7 But I'm thinking about getting some cats, you know, and then they... Oh, wait a second-oh, no, no, I mean  oh, shoot! No, Saturday night I'm gonna-  gonna sing. Yeah.	You're gonna sing? Do you sing? Well, no, it isn't  No kidding?  this is my first time. Oh, really? Where? I'd like to come.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no! No, I'm interested!
8 Oh, no-I mean, I'm just a-auditioning sort of at club. I don't-	No, so help me.
9 it's my first time.	That's okay, 'cause I know exactly what that's like. Listen-
10 Yeah.	you're gonna like night clubs, they're really a lotta fun.

1 You see, like you and I...	You are extremely sexy.
2 No, I'm not.	Unbelievably sexy. Yes, you are. Because... you know what you are? You're-you're polymorphously perverse.
3 Well, what does-what does that mean? I don't know what that is.	Uh... uh, you're-you're exceptional in bed because you got -you get pleasure in every part of your body when I touch you.
4 Ooooh!

1 Oh, you have my body.	Yeah, but that's not-that's no good. I want the whole thing.
2 Well, I need grass and so do you.	Well, it ruins it for me if you have grass  because, you know, I'm, like, a comedian-
3 M'hm.	so if I get a laugh from a person who's high, it doesn't count. You know-'cause they're always laughin'.
4 Were you always funny?	Hey, what is this-an interview? We're supposed to be making love.

1 What's- It's me, open up.	Oh.
2 Are you okay?  What's the matter?  Are you all right? What-	There's a spider in the bathroom.
3 What?	There's a big black spider in the bathroom.
4 That's what you got me here for at three o'clock in the morning, 'cause there's a spider in the bathroom?	My God, I mean, you know how I am about insects.
5 Oooh.	I can't sleep with a live thing crawling around in the bathroom.
6 Kill it! For Go- What's wrong with you? Don't you have a can of Raid in the house?	No.

1 -me, my God, it's a great day!	Hey, can yuh watch the road? Watch the --

1 You never wanna try anything new, Alvy.	How can you say that? I mean,  who said I-I-I-I said that you, I and that girl from your acting class should sleep together in a threesome.
2 That's sick!	Yeah, I know it's sick, but it's new. You know, you didn't say it couldn't be sick.

1 Oh, good. Okay.	I'm cool.

1 I tell you this because, as an artist, I think you'll understand. Sometimes when I'm driving... on the road at night... I see two headlights coming toward me. Fast. I have this sudden impulse to turn the wheel quickly, head-on into the oncoming car. I can anticipate the explosion.  The sound of shattering glass. The... flames rising out of the flowing gasoline.	Right. Tsch, well, I have to-I have t-o go now, Duane, because I-I'm due back on the planet earth.

1 Hey, come on, it's quiet now. We can- we can start again.	I can't.
2 What-	My head is throbbing.
3 Oh, you got a headache!	I have a headache.
4 Bad?	Oswald and ghosts.
5 Jesus!

1 Thank you very much. It's a pleasure.	This is, uh, Shawn, and, uh... Bob and Petronia.

1 Yeah, watch the road!	You'll total the whole car.

1 I think he has a little thing for Annie.	Oh, no, no, that's bullshit, Max. He goes with that girl over there.
2 Where?

1 You fired the cleaning woman?	She was stealing.
2 But she's colored.	SO?
3 So the colored have enough trouble.	She was going through my pocketbook!
4 They're persecuted enough!	Who's persecuting? She stole!

1 Oh, he's adorable, Annie.	You think so? Do you really?
2 We're going to take them to the airport.

1 Tessie, they say you were the sister with personality.	I was a great beauty.
2 Uh, how did this personality come about?	I was very charming.
3 There were many men interested in you?	Oh, I was quite a lively dancer.

1 Poor Mac.  It's been a bit of a struggle. I'm sure Sally's told you.	No, what?
2 The movie.	Oh, she's really enjoying it.  I think. Is Mac okay?
3 I don't know what's going on.  I don't care to guess.  Mac's really unhappy. She isn't there, that's all.  She's no idea what she's playing, not a clue.	Who, Sally?
4 And, you know it isn't rocket science, this script.  She can barely get the lines out.  There was a scene last week - she sobbed, through every take.  I know crying's easy for her but it's a fucking comedy, Joe.  Something's gone.  You know, that thing that was Sally - that always surprised you.  It's gone.  I think she's scared.  And that's death.	I still think she sails above the rest. I mean not like her early films.  But those were all such great directors.
5 Mac's a pretty great director, Joe.  He's a woman's director.  And nothing's happening.  Course he won't fire her, because of the friendship... But it was discussed.  He had to battle his studio to get her in the first place.	What?
6 Hey, listen, I love her.  She's Sophia's best friend.  I never said any of this, alright.  I'll deny it on the stand...  You guys are gonna have kids.  That is so great.  Maybe that's what this is all about.  Maybe she doesn't want to do this anymore.  You know adults don't do this for a living.  You guys are gonna have your kids, you'll be directing -- one asshole in the family is enough.  Sophia knew that intuitively.  Look at Clair. Clair's a mess.  Make sure she gets the epidural.  Forget that natural childbirth shit. Everything's going to be what it's supposed to be.  "Life is but a walking shadow.  A poor player who struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more..." And speaking of me, the role of Leo in your film?	Leo?
7 Any thoughts on casting yet?	Leo?  It was out to Jude Law.  Jude passed.
8 Well, I can't make any promises, and of course I haven't read the script but I loved the novel...when are you shooting?	October-ish.
9 I have a small window of time.	Leo.  Leo's twenty-eight, Cal.
10 Scratch the two, write in a four.	Scratch the two, write in a four.
11 You've got a lot of fucking gall.  Thirty nine.	Five years ago, I was at the party, remember?

1 Thank you, thank you, thank you.	My God, your wardrobe is incredible.  It took me forever to decide.  Oh, and I found Dr. X, thank you.  You saved my life.

1 That for us?	What a nose.  You missed your calling.
2 Can I open it?	Sally?
3 Please?

1 I know we're early, we're so early. Sorry.	You have to sign your taxes anyway.

1 We closed.	Fantastic.  Out here.

1 I love you.  Most beautiful woman in the world.	Hardly...
2 Accept a compliment.	I think you're the most beautiful woman in the world.

1 Otis!  No barking!	And Joe's huge in Europe.  He's like a rock star in London.  His novels sell millions.

1 Someone left the goddamn gate open.  Otis got out.  Skye and I, well the... I came out of the house and the fucking gate was wide open.	Oh for fuck's sake.  Nobody uses that gate.

1 Happy anniversary.	It's a Calder.
2 I know.	He's my favorite.
3 I know.  It's for the baby's crib.	Ah...

1 You got your DP?	What?  Oh yeah, the camera man?  They gave me a list.
2 And you got Skye Davidson.  Pretty big leagues for a first timer.  Do you even like movies?	Not particularly.  Weird, isn't it?  God I'm rally up.  Do you feel anything yet, Mac?
3 Kind of.  Hey, look - John Seale, Oliver Stapelton, Darius Khonji - they're friends.  And great DP's I could give them a call for you.	Thanks, Mac.  And thanks for being so supportive about all this.  I really love you, you know.
4 Hey, I'm happy for you, buddy.  Anything I can do.	God, I really need to jump about a bit.  How's your film going?

1 I've never done this before.	Oh?  It's easy.  You just put one foot in front of the other... That's a good girl.
2 I'm a little in the puke zone.	Here, drink this.  Drink lots of water.  Hold on to this.  Take deep breaths. Nice and slow.  Would you like a lolly?
3 What am I, five?	You're never too old for a lolly.  I'm having one.
4 Okay.

1 I was faking it.  I've been feeling caged for sometime.  Funny, huh?	No, it's not... Fuck fuck fuck fuck.

1 Hi.  Monica and Ryan?	Sally?
2 Yes.  And you've met Joe.

1 Good, you brought your violin.  I want you to play.	It's a machine gun.  I thought I'd kill myself.
2 Are you lovesick?	Suicidal.  It's much less codependent.
3 Will champagne help?	Not enough.

1 What did I do?	Panes is not on my team anymore.  I'll have Panes if I like.

1 Enough about me.	Evie has a little something for you.

1 Hey, slow it down, big boy.  You're making the rest of us look bad...How come I haven't seen you around here before?	I'm new...I was born yesterday.
2 Tell me about it.	Nobody told me digging was so much fun!  You pick up the dirt, you move it, you pick it up again, you move it again -- lots of repetitions, you exercise the forceps, and the pincers --
3 Mmm, yes, I see what you mean...

1 So uh -- how come I haven't seen you around here before?	I work in the palace, I don't get out much.
2 The palace, hunh?  I bet those royals really live it up.  Of course they're all a little, you know, from inbreeding --	<u>What</u>?

1 What <u>was</u> that thing?	How should <u>I know</u>?
2 I order you to find out where we are!	Alright, alright, I'll try to get directions from one of the locals.

1 Out here I'm just what?	Hlllllllp!
2 Stop fooling around in there.

1 Z!  what are you doing?	I know it's crazy, but -- I can't just leave.  Don't argue with me.  If I've learned anything, it's that the problems of two people don't add up to a hill of ants in this world.  Or beans.  Something like that.  Anyway, I've <u>got to warn the others</u>.

1 Well, what exactly does our platoon do?  Serve beverages?  Process paperwork?	Our platoon has the best assignment of all.  We're the first into battle!

1 Notice the big one, holding hands with the female?	Well, uh, who notices workers, sir?
2 No one should have to.  Have him brought to me.

1 Well I, I don't think "living it up" is the right term -- how about "working themselves to death"?	I tell you son, sometimes, at night, I see myself in battle, fighting a horrible, faceless enemy, with the future of our whole species at stake. And always, the dream ends with each of us plunging his sword into the other's heart...
2 Oh, hey, that's great, I think I see an old war buddy over there, it's been fun chatting.  Good luck with the hallucinations.

1 Ask me why we're so successful.	Why are we so successful?
2 I'm glad you asked me that question!

1 Wear this.	You're a real buddy.
2 Yeah, I know.	What do I do?
3 Don't tell anyone you're a worker. Follow that column over there.  And come right back after the inspection!

1 You wouldn't have such a thing as a napkin, would you?	Well, I have some paper towels --
2 Beatnik! Go to my kitchen -- third drawer, under the good silver, there is napkins.	Yes, Mrs. Dreyfuss. He starts out with a worried backward glance toward the two. Fran is just sitting there, the spoon in her hand, not touching the soup.
3 So what are you waiting for -- a singing commercial?

1 Good night.	Good night.

1 Guess I made a boo-boo, huh?	No -- I like it.
2 Really? You mean you wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with somebody in a hat like this?	Of course not.
3 Maybe if I wore it a little more to the side --  is that better?	Much better.
4 Well, as long as you wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with me -- how about the three of us going out this evening -- you and me and the bowler -- stroll down Fifth Avenue -- sort of break it in --	This is a bad day for me.
5 I understand. Christmas -- family and all that --	I'd better get back to my elevator. I don't want to be fired.
6 Oh, you don't have to worry about that. I have quite a bit of influence in Personnel. You know Mr. Sheldrake?	Why?
7 He and I are like this.  Sent me a Christmas card. See?

1 Here. How about some breakfast?	No -- I don't want anything.
2 I'll fix you some coffee.

1 I just have this talent for falling in love with the wrong guy in the wrong place at the wrong time. BUD  How many guys were there?	Three. The last one was manager of a finance company, back home in Pittsburgh -- they found a little shortage in his accounts, but he asked me to wait for him -- he'll be out in 1965.
2 Cut.	So I came to New York and moved in with my sister and her husband -- he drives a cab. They sent me to secretarial school, and I applied for a job with Consolidated - but I flunked the typing test --
3 Too slow?	Oh. I can type up a storm, but I can't spell. So they gave me a pair of white gloves and stuck me in an elevator -- that's how I met Jeff --  Oh, God, I'm so fouled up. What am I going to do now?
4 You better win a hand -- you're on a blitz.	Was he really upset when you told him?
5 Mr. Sheldrake? Oh, yes. Very.	Maybe he does love me -- only he doesn't have the nerve to tell his wife.
6 I'm sure that's the explanation.	You really think so?
7 No doubt about it.	Can I have that pad and the pencil?
8 What for?	I'm going to write a letter to Mrs. Sheldrake.
9 You are?	As one woman to another -- I'm sure she'll understand --
10 Miss Kubelik, I don't think that's such a good idea.

1 I know how you feel, Miss Kubelik. You think it's the end of the world -- but it's not, really. I went through exactly the same thing myself.	You did?
2 Well, maybe not exactly -- I tried to do it with a gun.	Over a girl?
3 Worse than that -- she was the wife of my best friend -- and I was mad for her. But I knew it was hopeless -- so I decided to end it all. I went to a pawnshop and bought a forty-five automatic and drove up to Eden Park -- do you know Cincinnati?	No, I don't.
4 Anyway, I parked the car and loaded the gun -- well, you read in the papers all the time that people shoot themselves, but believe me, it's not that easy -- I mean, how do you do it? -- here, or here, or here --  -- you know where I finally shot myself?	Where?
5 Here.	In the knee?
6 Uh-huh. While I was sitting there, trying to make my mind up, a cop stuck his head in the car, because I was illegally parked -- so I started to hide the gun under the seat and it went off -- pow!	That's terrible.
7 Yeah. Took me a year before I could bend my knee -- but I got over the girl in three weeks. She still lives in Cincinnati, has four kids, gained twenty pounds -- she sends me a fruit cake every Christmas.	Are you just making that up to make me feel better?
8 Of course not. Here's the fruit cake.  And you want to see my knee? 

1 Are you all right?	I'm fine.
2 Are you sure? How's your knee?	I'm fine all over.
3 Mind if I come in?	Of course not.

1 Tell me, Baxter -- just what is it that makes you so popular?	I don't know.
2 Think.

1 I like the way you handled that. Well, how does it feel to be an executive?	Fine. And I want you to know I'll work very hard to justify your confidence in me -- SHELDRAKE Sure you will.  Say, Baxter, about the apartment - now that you got a raise, don't you think we can afford a second key?
2 Well -- I guess so.	You know my secretary -- Miss Olsen --
3 Oh, yes. Very attractive. Is she -- the lucky one?	No, you don't understand. She's a busybody -- always poking her nose into things -- and with that key passing back and forth -- why take chances?
4 Yes, sir. You can't be too careful.

1 Say, Baxter -- you gave me the wrong key.	No I didn't.
2 But this is the key to the executive washroom.	That's right, Mr. Sheldrake. I won't be needing it -- because I'm all washed up around here.

1 Hello? Yeah, Baxter. What's up?	Instead of Friday -- could you possibly switch to Thursday? You'd be doing me a great favor --
2 Well -- it's all right with me, Bud. Let me check. I'll get back to you.

1 Oh, Buddy-boy. I was just about to call you.  I'm sorry about that mess on the living room wall. You see, my little friend, she kept insisting Picasso was a bum -- so she started to do that mural -- but I'm sure it will wash off -- just eyebrow pencil.	It's not Picasso I'm calling about. It's the key -- to my apartment -- you were supposed to leave it under the mat.
2 I did, didn't I? I distinctly remember bending over and putting it there --	Oh, I found a key there, all right -- only it's the wrong key.
3 It is?  Well, how about that? No wonder I couldn't get into the executive washroom this morning.	And I couldn't get into my apartment -- so at four a. m. I had to wake up the landlady and give her a whole song and dance about going out to mail a letter and the door slamming shut.
4 That's a shame. I'll send the key right down. And about your promotion --  -- I'm sending that efficiency report right up to Mr. Sheldrake, in Personnel. I wouldn't be surprised if you heard from him before the day is over.	Thank you, Mr. Dobisch.

1 What are you going to do, Doc?	Get that stuff out of her stomach -- if it isn't too late. You better put some coffee on -- and pray.

1 Say, Baxter -- we're having a little party and we ran out of ice -- so I was wondering --	Sure, Doc.
2 How come you're alone on New Year's Eve?	Well, I have things to do --
3 What's this -- you packing?	Yeah -- I'm giving up the apartment.

1 Say, what's going on here, anyway?	Nothing.  Just clear out, will you?
2 My shoes.

1 What's with you, Fran -- did you forget where you live?	This is my brother-in-law, Karl Matuschka.

1 Where are we going, Jeff? Not back to that leaky boat --	I promise.

1 Some setup you got here.  A real, honest-to-goodness love nest.	Sssssh.

1 We need all our fuel anyway.	Wait -- wait -- don't get up tight -- what I meant was we'd need a whole drum for that --
2 Sit down -- we'll talk about it.

1 Were you Longe Range Recon --	No -- I worked too far north for LRRP.

1 I know it sounds stupid, but I feel like the goddamn jungle's watching us.	Probably is.
2 Whatdoya think it thinks.	That we're dumber than we look.

1 You forgot the mangoes, didn't you?	Mangoes? There as a fucking tiger in the woods -- I could've been eaten alive. I'm never going into that jungle again. I gotta remember never get out of the boat; never get outta the boat.

1 Careful,  Captain, they've been known to charge.	All right I got a little surprise for you --

1 Why -- Charlie put it there to kill --	Thta's not Charlie's work --

1 What do you want ?	If you're B.L. Willard, 4th Recon Group, we'd like you to come with us.
2 Whose orders ?

1 Who is he?	He was the tragedy -- the tragedy of this war.

1 We don't want to bother you any, we --	A man of war is never bothered to aid an ally -- you will follow me, Captain.

1 Good swell.	What, sir?
2 I said it's a good swell -- hell of a good swell 'bout six feet. Let's get a look at it.

1 This is Baker Delta Four -- Captain hit bad -- need dust-off. Receiving heavy automatic weapons fire from huts about thirty yards to our left.	Big Duke Six to Baker Delta Four -- hold -- we're right over you.

1 It's gonna blow this place out. It's gonna ruin it ...	The kid can't ride sloppy waves.

1 How did we get here?	Because of all the things we do, the thing we do best -- is lie.
2 I think think a lie stinks.	Oh Captain, that is so true.
3 Stinks. I could never figure --  I could never figure how they can teach boys how to bomb villages with napalm -- and not let them write the word 'fuck' on their airplanes.

1 This one , Lance?	Yeah, Jesus Christ !

1 This boat's a mess.	Where's Kurtz? I want to talk to him.
2 Oh, you don't talk to Colonel Kurtz.  You listen to him. God, these are good. I kept these people off you, you know. It wasn't easy.	Why did they attack us?
3 Simple. They don't want him to go.	You're Australian?
4 Pre-Australian, actually. But I'd dig goin' to California. I'm California dreamin'.	So Kurtz is alive.
5 Kurtz. I tell you, that man has enlarged my mind.

1 I'm afraid I won't have time -- I gotta --	Whe you reach the boat you will find that half your fifty calibre stores -- a case of grenades, a mortar and two M-16's and a case of clips are being transfered to us by your order.

1 23   CONTINUED:	Needs patching.

1 What makes you so sure my boys won't be waiting for us?	139  CONTINUED:

1 ...I won't let a killer walk!	157  CONTINUED:

1 39   CONTINUED:	Back against the bars.  Now.

1 Stay here.	Be careful -- there're two of them.

1 Let's go.	Wait a second.

1 Go ahead.  Take the jeep.  I'll come to Cache with Bob when he gets here.	Okay by me.  You're the one likes these hot springs so much.
2 Leave my traps.  We'll tag up, couple days.

1 Sounds like professional jealousy.	Hunting and trapping was a damn fine life.  Me and Mitchell, Bob and LeMalle, we were teams.  I'd always go with Mitchell.  Good man, Mitchell.  I'd let Bob worry about goddamn LeMalle.  We'd hire a plane in October.  On the way to a dirt airstrip somewhere, we'd drop supplies.  We'd land, tell the pilot to come back for us a few days before Christmas.

1 Have to backtrack, find another way down.	Forget it.  It would take days.
2 Going to be a bit of a challenge with handcuffs on.

1 I'm hungry.  Go kill me some dinner.	An appetite.  Maybe you won't die after all.
2 Hate to disappoint you.

1 Maybe you can talk sense into your boyfriend.	Shut up!
2 

1 Christ if I shouldn't know better than to step in soft earth.  I've seen footprints in the tundra a hundred years old.	I got it from here.  Thanks.
2 Sam, give Dixie here fifty bucks out of my kit, will you?

1 Look, Mr. Desmond, I didn't count on it turning this ugly.	What are you talking about?
2 Bastards killed Sam, you think they won't kill the rest of us?	There'll be three, four men at the most.  I have some backup, nothing will happen.
3 I'm real sorry.  In a while, you're gone from this country. But we live here.  No one wants to mix it up with those hombres.

1 Wilder's missing church services; you believe it?	I just as soon he stay gone. Fool could've got us all killed, arresting Ben Corbett here in town.

1 Look, we pull Ben's ass out of the fire, I'll get you a whole damn crate of Snickers bars.	I'm right fuckin' here with you.

1 I didn't know you had a secret admire.	Huh?
2 You met the gift.

1 He's good...  And I'm an expert on doctors.	Stay out of this...  Doctor?

1 Clippity clop -- clippity clop -- she has to pretend she doesn't hear me. Listening to the story from the upset friend...  now she drops off the cappuccino and smiles at the putzette who doesn't even say, "Thank you." No, the putzette wanted the whipped cream so back she goes and now she has to pass him again and it's getting tougher to make believe.	Okay.

1 Sorry, honey...  I'll be right there.	How ya doing?

1 No... no thank you notes.	Well, part of what I said in this entire history of my life which you won't read is that somehow you've done more for my mother, my son and me, than anyone else ever has... And that makes you the most important, surprising, generous person I've ever met and that you be in our daily prayers forever.
2 Lovely.	I also wrote one part... I wrote I'm sorry... I was talking about I was sorry when I got mad at you when you came over and you told my son that he ought to answer back so I wrote that.  I was sorry for busting you on that... and I'm sorry for busting in on you that night... when I said I was never... I was sorry and I'm sorry every time your food was cold and that you had to wait two seconds for a coffee filler...

1 ... my father didn't leave his room for 11 years -- he hit my hand with a yardstick if I made a mistake on the piano.	Go ahead, Simon. Your father walked in on you and was yelling and... really, come on.

1 I am so afraid you're about to say something awful...	Don't be pessimistic. It's not your style. Okay... Here I goes... Clearly a mistake.  I have this -- what? Ailment... And my doctor -- a shrink... who I used to see all the time... he says 50 or 60 percent of the time a pill can really help. I hate pills. Very dangerous things, pills. "Hate," I am using the word "hate" about pills. My compliment is that when you came to my house that time and told me how you'd never -- well, you were there, you know... The next morning I started taking these pills.
2 I don't quite get how that's a compliment for me.

1 Here are the keys to my apartment. I'm going to park you in my place while I take Carol home.	I'll take a bus.
2 I'll take you... why not?	I don't care what you did for me. I don't think I want to know you anymore -- all you do is make me feel badly about myself.  You have my number.

1 I don't know the last time I've been out of the city... Hey, my arms are tanning. I used to tan great. We gotta stop soon so'se I can check on Spencer.	I'm sorry... I can't hear you. I can't turn my head all the way yet... tell her we can't hear her.

1 I love you...  Let him take you home.	Don't want to. I love you.

1 Definitely a package you don't want to open or touch.	Hope you find him. I love that dog.

1 Okay... so I'll see you tomorrow. Let's not drag this out. We don't enjoy another that much.	If there's some mental health foundation that raises money to help people like you be sure to let me know.
2 Last word freak.

1 Is he dead yet?	No! Would there be any way for you to be willing to walk his dog for him?
2 Absolutely.	Not just today -- Uh, could you do it -- until, until he gets back on his feet?
3 Sure thing.	You're a wonderful man. Two o'clock is a good time. Here's the key in case he's asleep. Open the curtains for him, so he sees God's beautiful work and knows that even things like this happen for the best.
4 Where'd they teach you to talk like this -- some Panama City "Sailor want to hump-hump bar"? Or was today getaway day and your last shot at his whiskey. Sell crazy some place else -- we're all stocked up here.

1 That's some face they left hanging on you. You look like...	Could you take it just a little easy, Mr. Udall?

1 I, uh... I was... attacked. Walked in on people robbing me. I was hospitalized. I almost died.	Let's do the small talk in the car. Load up.

1 I think you gotta camp it here...	What are you talking about?

1 So you're practically finished, huh?	Yes...  well, there's one more stage -- trying to figure out if it's any good.

1 Boy, that's fucking genius.  You're a fucking genius.  Then you're just sitting there, bullshitting with me. Man, no way I coulda done that!	What's your name?  We both know it's not Nicholai.
2 Holy shit!  Robert Rath wants to know my name.

1 How'd you know?  Just tell me that. How'd you fucking know?	I knew the same way in ten years you're going to know.
2 What does that fucking mean?	It means that I'm going to tell you things, even though I already know that you're not going to listen to a God damned thing I say.

1 Hi.  Up ahead my boss is in that black limo.  We're not sure which hotel we're at, so could you just follow them?	Sure.

1 Who is the mark?	Freelancer.  A woman.  Surveillance specialist.

1 Nikita?  She helped me find you.	What?  How did you know I had a cat?
2 Took a guess.  Lucky for you, I guessed right.	Who the fuck are you?  Who do you work for?
3 I work for the government.	Yeah?

1 Don't tell me I don't have a choice!	Right.
2 I'm two seconds away from making my choice which means you've got two seconds to tell me why I shouldn't shoot you.	It's simple.  You need me.  I need you.  And we will both need money.
3 I don't need you to get the money -- my money!	If it hadn't been for me, you would be dead.

1 I killed him.	Why?
2 Because that's how it works.  That's what it's about.  He was the best. He was on top.	Where you wanted to be?
3 Yes.  As soon as you get into this business, all you can think about is getting to the top.  That's all there is.  Until then, there is nothing.  You are nothing.	How did you get into the business?
4 The same way everyone does; the government, the Agency.	The C.I.A.?
5 More or less.	How old were you?
6 They recruited me when I was in high school.	Jesus -- why?
7 Languages.  I was already fluent in nine languages.	You were like a boy genius?
8 Some people said that.  I never thought so.	Why not?
9 I was just different.	You went from high school to the Agency?
10 No.  I graduated from George Washington University.  Then I entered the Agency training program.	They didn't give you a choice, did they?
11 No, they didn't.	But you knew what they were training you for?
12 Of course.  I was going to be James Bond.	Ahhhh...
13 They are very good at what they do. It's very seductive.  The training, the weapons, the travel --	The exotic women.
14 Women?  No... not really.	Why not?
15 Women... I don't... I don't want to talk about women.	Why?
16 Because you are a women.	Why did you leave the Agency?
17 The same reason everyone does.  You hear your name on C-SPAN and you realize you're a skeleton in someone's closet and they're coming to bury you.	They tried to kill you?
18 Yes.  It didn't matter much to them as long as I disappeared.	Then you went freelance?
19 The only thing different about the private sector is that a General Contractor takes less of a percentage than the government, so you make more money.  Then once you make the transition, you realize you were never working for the government; it was always the private sector, the vested interests and it's the same vested interests that continue to buy your plane tickets.	Tell me about the first time.
20 My first take?	Yes.
21 Why?	Because I want to know.
22 It was... mechanical.  Very precise. It was exactly like the training drill except for the adrenaline.	Are they usually like that?
23 No.  Just the first one.	After that?
24 They become complicated... messy.	Did it ever bother you?
25 Did it ever bother James Bond?	That's fiction.
26 This is fiction!  Don't you see that?  This is another reality.  And the people that come into the world to play this game -- nobody forces them!  They're here, they know the rules, the stakes, the risks!  Do you understand what I am saying?  No one is innocent -- including you!	Does that mean it didn't bother you?

1 I'm kind of tired.  I think I'd like to try and get some sleep.	You can have the bed.  The chair is fine for me.

1 You'll be here.  A restaurant.  A public place far enough away that he won't notice you, but with a good enough view you'll be able to see him when he moves inside.	Okay.  Then what?
2 Then, we wait.	Aiiee.  More waiting?  I don't know if I like this plan.
3 It will take the entire day, but he will begin to doubt himself.  He will begin to believe that he missed me, that somehow I slipped by and am already on a plane to Europe.

1 Can I ask you something?	I'm sure you will.
2 Am I attractive?

1 I prefer it like this.	How can a beautiful man like you be shy?

1 Thank you.	Anytime.

1 Excellent, senor.  If you could follow me?	I'm sorry, but I am waiting for an associate.  Can you hold everything for me until he arrives?
2 Of course, senor.	Thank you.

1 Inspirations a fickle thing, you don't realise you had it till it's gone.	And not even then sometimes.

1 What we need is a space for real performance art. A cultural exchange for radical expressionism.	You've got to stop using that word "we" it's getting kind of scary. Right Katka?

1 I feel like a mole in this joint, so I guess I might as well come out lookin' like one!	Don't worry, I'll give you a hand as soon as I can.

1 I'd love to get in there.	Don't we have enough already?
2 It must be fair old size, suppose it's empty?	And suppose a little old lady lives there?
3 No way, it's sealed - if she's in there she's dead.	Sounds like a good reason to leave it alone.
4 Just think though, it would make a hell of a cafe, that way we keep the auditorium clear.

1 Like a hand?	When your ready Son!

1 Thanks. Come on Chris, give me a hand.	I can't, I've got to split. I have to take a class at two o'clock.

1 You know, there is one thing I can't figure out. All along they've been bugging me about those files and when I told them I'd burned all that stuff, they went nuts - they told the Consul guy they were medical records?	So?
2 Well, it seems they've dropped any charge relating to the files.	Lucky break!
3 Maybe, but I've started to wonder what those files were all about. Suppose it was old KGB stuff and had the dirt on big people or maybe the personnel records of the secret police, that might explain all the hassle and the cover-up.	Did you see anything in the files?
4 It was all in Czech wasn't it.	What happened to those disks I gave you, have you still got them?
5 Yeah, somewhere?	Suppose those contained all the file info too? You could have a third or so of it there.
6 Do you want me to see what's on them?	No point, it'll be in Czech and God knows what format. But if I'm right, they could be my ticket out of here.
7 And if you're wrong.	Siberia.
8 What do you want me to do?	Get me one of the disks. Ask a Czech girl to smuggle it in to me this evening. Put the others in a locker and write the details in a note to Reuters and be ready to send it, if this doesn't work. You'd better keep clear of your apartment too. Do you know someone with a phone?
9 Yeah, Dave Walters.	Good, what's his number?

1 You mean, Josh's father had nothing to do with it?	No!
2 You're sure?	Sure I'm sure!

1 I'd like to talk with you about doing some performance poetry here....A weekly thing.	Hmm, I see possibilities but you got a lot to do.
2 We should be done by the weekend.	Really?
3 I could pencil you in if you like?	I'll take a rain-check for now.

1 Don't give me this Kat, I'm doing it for you and your country.	What? You are crazy!
2 Look, just hear me out, okay?

1 I want you so bad. She'll be asleep soon, maybe we could do it quietly under the sheets.	No way Doug, I can't.
2 Yeah, you're right.... I've got an idea!

1 Forget about me Kat.	But I love you!

1 Yes, it's looks good.....We will use this for the soundtrack and we will have two guys up there with the spotlights. The others will just be house lights.	Great....How long will it go for?
2 About forty minutes.	Cool....So, if we say eight o'clock.

1 No act of love but willing violence demanded by one and begged by the other. As life turned to fantasy and reality to ecstasy a need, so deep no light could reach, surfaced like a nocturnal creature unearthed for momentary and glorious display. Left alone in a rose-tinted afterglow dimming fast she tasted the moisture of her body and wondered why light came to day and such desires to her pale-skin body.	Well she sure isn't normal.

1 It's all my fault, I'm so sorry Doug.	I had it coming from someone.
2 Are you sure I shouldn't get a doctor.

1 Why did you break into that particular building?	It was the biggest I could find.
2 What was the real purpose behind this venture?	A kind of freedom.
3 Either you're a liar or you are a fool.

1 That's okay I like the metro, it's only a couple of stops from here.	I insist, it is the least we can do.

1 Yeah, so I hear. Don't you think you should go get changed?	Later.
2 Okay honey, but don't be long. I got plans.

1 You are responsible...What has happened?	We're not sure...

1 She asleep?	I'll tell her you were here.

1 Honey, some of this is... farfetched. You take after me. People skills and common sense. Good dependable qualities.	I could take after Dad, too.
2 You do. You're handsome and charming.	I meant he's a doctor.
3 That's eight years of school and training -- after college. And all that doesn't necessarily make you a better human being.	I could do it if I tried. Even Kelly thinks so.
4 That'd be something.

1 Hypotheticals --	I'm just wondering --

1 I'm very sorry --	What kind of a man are you, son?

1 Yeah.	Why?
2 Because that's where the fire is?

1 No problem --	And you have to meet my father.

1 You're really into God, right?	In ten words or less?
2 Yeah.	My relationship with God is my own.
3 But you think about Him -- It -- Her.	Don't you?

1 You were great the other night.	Thank you. So were you.

1 She great or what?	Why are you doing all this? To impress me?
2 No.  But are you -- impressed?

1 Stand right here.	Where?

1 How do you know this place?	Before the divorce. My father used to take me here. Fire spotting was his summer job.

1 Can you locate XXI5639I?	Sure.

1 Help me live until I die?	I will.

1 How're you doing?	Better. I was really angry.

1 I'm asking how much.	Dad --
2 It's time to tell him.  It would be the right thing.

1 Landon. You're not the quiet type.	No.
2 So talk to us about something.	Like what, sir?
3 You decide.

1 You're marrying again.	Yes.
2 Jamie wanted that. She told me.

1 For Jefferson High. For books.	Where did you get -- ?
2 It's mine to give. I didn't steal it.	I didn't say you did.

1 I've been calling you for five minutes! Didn't you hear me?	I was practicing. I've got an audition next week -- I gotta practice. How am I gonna get famous if I don't practice?

1 What time does school start around here?	Nine o' clock.  Oh, I'm late! Maybe I'll see you later.
2 Yeah. Maybe so.

1 Is that what you were going to ask me, George? To go to the dance?	No!

1 What is that? A pencil that writes in ink?	It was Marty's turn to be confused. Huh?
2 Lemme see that.

1 Yeah, explode it up your ass!	Unfortunately, the way things are going, you may get your wish. You may see the entire annhiliation of the world. If not, you'll certainly see the destruction of all out natural resources. We can already see the air we breathe, not to mention the pollution in our rivers and lakes. We'll  see all of our oil reserves depleted, in fact, all of our energy sources. Yes, you people have a lot to look forward to -- a lot to see.
2 Hey, Mr. Arky, gimme a break!  I'm seventeen years old! I'm not responsible for all these problems!

1 Okay, Martin. You have a good evening now.	Yeah,  Right.

1 The plutonium! That's what I came over here for! Professor, where did you get that stuff?	Why?

1 Well, there's a mall here now -- I mean, there will be.	A mall?
2 Yeah, a shopping mall. You know, a shopping mall?

1 Let me put it on a level you can understand. You don't belong here. You don't know anything about this world. You don't know the customs, you don't know how to talk, how to act -- you don't even look like you belong here. And if you walked out on the street, you wouldn't get 100 yards without being arrested. Then there would be questions, and where would we come up with the answers?	Okay, Professor, I get where you're coming from. The way I look, the way I'm dressed...  I'd stick out like a sore thumb.

1 Look. I'm a little worried about this -- this whole thing with my mother, he admitted to the Professor. I mean, I don't know if I can do it -- I mean, hitting on my own mother, that's pretty heavy.	Nobody said anything about hitting her! You're just going to take a few liberties with her.
2 That's exactly what I said! I mean, a guy and his mother -- that's illegal, isn't it?	Look, Marty, she's not your mother yet. And if you don't go through with this, she may never be. I know it's hard, but there are some things we must do in life that are unpleasant. Some choices must be made that are difficult. Nonetheless, we must make them. Besides, this may be more than a simple question of your own existence, he added. The fate of the entire space-time continuum may rest on your shoulders . Marty tried to smile at him.
3 That's just what I needed to hear.	It'll be fine, Marty.  You'll be fine. Good luck. He stuck his hand out and Marty shook it. But there was still a question that was nagging at him...
4 Professor, if something does go wrong tonight... if I don't get my parents back together... when do you think I'd cease to exist?

1 Obviously!  	But I told everyone your disappearance was due to a teleportation experiment you were helping me with. So don't mention anything about time travel to anyone.
2 What theater was I at?	The Orpheum.

1 Nah, skip that... I'm going to have to keep an eye on you, though.	Okay.
2 You don't mind?

1 What'd they look like?	Kind of round, like so... Gold. I'll show you if you want.

1 Sure is pretty.	What'd you come out here for?
2 I wasn't aware there was any law against it.

1 You still in school?	Nah, I got me a job.
2 Doing what?	Well, I don't mind getting up early, so I got a job throwing garbage... I'm not in love with the stuff, okay.

1 Somebody else is going to get it.	I don't care.
2 Kids eat that kind of stuff in Korea.

1 "The Kon-Tiki in motion was a little different from what it usually was in such conditions. We had become sensitive to changes in the rhythm of the logs. I thought at once of suction from the coast, which was drawing near, and was continually out on the deck and up the mast..."	He was nervous.

1 Don't.	Anybody ever done that to you before?
2 No.	Positive?
3 Yes.	Guess there's no way I'll ever know. For sure.

1 You know... they'd probably ask to see your driver's license before they hired you.	Well. I'm not going to let that stop me.

1 Hi, whatcha doing?	Just thinking.
2 Good a way to kill time as any... She okay?

1 You tossed my hat out the window.	Wanta sue me?
2 No.

1 We at the Banzai Institute have at last found that way: an alternating gradient synchronizer that softens solid matter by attenuating its electroweak forces!	Which we all know are the forces that tend to pull objects part, right, professor?

1 What crate?	I think I'm on to something. You and the guys go back to the house and dig up everything you can on an outfit called Yoyodyne.
2 Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems?  You think they're mixed up in this?

1 Planet 10?  The same Planet 10 you postulated beyond Pluto, Perfect Tommy?  The invisible body?	Yeah, but most of 'em blasted in through the Eighth Dimension in 1938 at Grover's Mills, New Jersey...

1 Does this thing have guns, John Parker?	Boy, I hope so, Buckaroo Banzai.

1 Raise your hand...where?	This is so embarrassing...
2 Somebody get her a mike? Can we manage that?  And a spotlight.  What's your name?	Penny.  I'd rather not reveal my last name or my age.

1 You keep an eye on it.	Any time.

1 ...hit Smolensk and precipitate a thermonuclear war, Mr. President.	A what?
2 A thermonuclear holocaust, sir.  These creatures from Planet 10 are ready to exploit Soviet-American tensions and get us to blow each other off the face of the earth, sir, if necessary.	You're quite serious about this, aren't you, Buckaroo.  We know each other pretty well, I think.

1 It's a spittin' image.	Doesn't look anything like her to me.
2 Pictures don't lie.	Hell they don't. I met my first wife that way.
3 It's Peggy to these eyes.  Same nose, same hair.  Plus Buckaroo thinks so too or else he wouldn't be ready to go make a fool of himself, right?

1 Is, uh... Is he okay?	He will be... When he can't write, he drinks.

1 Hello, Barton.	Audrey, thank you for coming. Thank you.  I'm sorry to be such a... such a... Thank you.

1 Am I? Maybe to a schoolboy's eye. People who know about the human heart, though, mebbe they'd say, Bill over here, he gives his honey love, and she pays him back with pity  the basest coin there is.	Stop it, Bill!

1 Yeah, he's funny that way.	I...

1 I'll jus' walk on down to the Pacific, and from there I'll... improvise.	Are you all right?

1 We have to talk a little business. I've just been on the phone to Los Angeles.  Barton, Capitol Pictures wants to put you under contract. They've offered you a thousand dollars a week. I think I can get them to go as high as two.	To do what?
2 What do you do far a living?	I'm not sure anymore. I guess I try to make a difference.
3 Fair enough. No pressure here, Barton, because I respect you, but let me point out a couple of things. One, here you make a difference to five hundred fifty people a night  if the show sells out.  Eighty five million people go to the pictures every week.	To see pap.
4 Yes, generally, to see pap. However, point number two: A brief tenure in Hollywood could support you through the writing of any number of plays.	I don't know, Garland; my place is here right now. I feel I'm on the brink of success-
5 I'd say you're already enjoying some.

1 ...In spite of what you might think from tonight, I'm pretty good at it.	Doesn't surprise me at all.
2 Hell yes. Because I believe in it. Fire, theft, and casualty are not things that only happen to other people  that's what I tell 'em. Writing doesn't work out, you might want to look into it. Providing for basic human need  a fella could do worse.	Thanks, I'll keep it in mind.
3 What kind of scribbler are you  newspaperman did you say?	No, I'm actually writing for the pictures now 
4 Pictures! Jesus!

1 Ah, doctors. What's he gonna tell me?  Can't trade my head in for a new one.	No, I guess you're stuck with the one you've got. Have a seat.

1 It's okay, it's okay.	Well, that's all that wrestling is. Except usually there's more grunting and squirming before the pin. Well, it's your first time. And you're out of your weight class.

1 ...I guess it seems pathetic to a guy like you.	Well...
2 Well it's pathetic, isn't it? I mean to a guy from New York.	What do you mean?
3 This kind of heat. It's pathetic.	Well, I guess you pick your poison.
4 So they say.	Don't pick up and leave without saying goodbye.
5 Course not, compadre. You'll see me again.

1 Jesus, Charlie, I...	Everything's okay, believe me. I know it's rough mentally, but everything's taken care of.
2 Charlie! I've got no one else here! You're the only person I know in Los Angeles...

1 ...Well Bart, which is it? Orphan? Dame?	...Both maybe?

1 I'm sorry if I let you down.	You didn't let ME down. Or even Lou. We don't live or die by what you scribble, Fink. You let Ben Geisler down. He liked you. Trusted you. And that's why he's gone. Fired.  That guy had a heart as big as the outdoors, and you fucked him. He tried to convince me to fire you too, but that would be too easy. No, you're under contract and you're gonna stay that way.  Anything you write will be the property of Capitol Pictures. And Capitol Pictures will not produce anything you write. Not until you grow up a little. You ain't no writer, Fink  you're a goddamn write-off.
2 I tried to show you something beautiful.  Something about all of US 

1 ...Yeah, he... he lives next door to me.	That's right, Fink, he lives next door to you.

1 ...I thought you said you were a writer.	I dunno, Duke. I kinda liked it.

1 Get down on your knees, you sonofabitch!  Get down on your knees and kiss this man's feet!	Mr. Lipnik, please 

1 The boat blew.  There was a leak in the gas line.  There were two previous repairs.  There was a five-mil policy on both of 'em.  A real heavy investigation.  Zilch. Goose-egg.  It was an accident.	Thanks.

1 What was she like?	Who?
2 Catherine Tramell.	She said what you said she'd say.

1 Beth.  I didn't mean what I said. About --	Yes you did.  I'm a big girl.  I can handle it.

1 Put your fucking hands up!  Don't move.	I got a message on my machine to meet Gus here.  Where is he?

1 What's your new book about?	A detective.  He falls for the wrong woman.

1 I'm tired.	It's got to be tiring to beat that machine.

1 Noah was my counselor in my freshman year.  That's probably where I got the idea for the icepick.  For my book. Funny how the subconscious works.  Hazel is my friend.	She wiped out her whole family.
2 Yes.  She's helped me understand homicidal impulse.	Didn't you study it in school?
3 Only in theory.  You know all about homicidal impulse, don't you, shooter?  Not in theory -- in practice.

1 Aren't you going to thank me?	What's it about?
2 A boy kills his parents.  They have a plane.  He makes it look like an accident.

1 How's your shoulder?	Fine.  How's your back?
2 It hurts.

1 You won't believe me.	Try me.

1 How'd you get in here?	I decided to give you one more chance.  I missed you.
2 You didn't not see me long enough to miss me.	Did you miss me?
3 No.	Come over here and tell me no.

1 Did you kill Mr. Boz, Ms. Tramell?	I'd have to be pretty stupid to write a book about a killing and then kill him the way I described in my book. I'd be announcing myself as the killer.  I'm not stupid.

1 Was she ever a suspect?	Nope.  There was some talk; it never panned.
2 What kind of talk?	The usual -- a girlfriend.
3 He had a girlfriend?	Nope. She did.  Like I say.  It never panned.
4 Thanks.	I hope I helped you out.
5 You did.

1 No, sir.  You won't.  There's smoke off yonder on the horizon.  They're gonna want your badge.	I got tired of being played with.
2 You sure got real conclusive ways of demonstrating that.

1 You all right, pop?  You want me to drive you?	In that little pissant car of yours? Hell, no.  I ain't gettin' no back pain disability retirement -- I'm gettin' me a full pension and a real gold-plate Seiko watch.
2 Come on, I'll drive you in this thing.	You think I'd let you drive my Cadillac car?  I ain't lettin' no hear-up-his-ass person drive my Cadillac car.

1 Maybe it's for old-time's sake.	Sometimes I think he started banging her just to get himself off the hook with Internal Affairs.
2 He ain't that way.  He's got heart.	Yeah.  I know.

1 So what do we do -- nothing?	We bring her in for questioning.

1 She's a suspect.	On what basis?
2 Catherine Tramell.  Age 30.  No priors, no convictions.  Double major, magnum cum laude, Berkeley, 1980.  Literature and Psychology. Daughter, sole survivor -- Marvin and Elaine Tramell, killed in a boating accident, 1978, Catherine Tramell sole heir.  Estimated assets $110 million.

1 My name is Jean Michel Basquiat. Have you heard of me?	No. Should I have?
2 I'm a painter, too.	Really. Huh. Too bad.

1 I wish they'd quit writing this shit about me.	That's good. At least they're interested.
2 Everybody's paying top dollar for scraps of paper, refrigerator doors  anything with a SAMO tag on it.  The other day, I just wanted a pack of cigarettes, so I did a drawing and sold it for two bucks. A week later this gallery calls me up: "Somebody's offering us the drawing. Should we buy it for five thousand?"	Wow... Stop giving them away.  I got an invitation to model for Comme de Garcons... You wanna do it with me?
3 Yeah  I'd do that... You could teach me.	Gee. I don't need to. You're a natural. You should sign up with my modeling agent.

1 Who is it?	Annina Nosei.
2 Who?

1 Chill, man! Be cool! This isn't even my apartment!	Oh man, you a FINE nigga! You know that?
2 Cut it out, man! And don't be callin' me that shit!

1 Bruno spoke to me already. We could talk about it.	I'm here.
2 OK. I'll be at your studio Thursday three o'clock.

1 It's Andy again.	Still not here.
2  In this corner?	Yeah..

1 You're shattering all my myths.	About what?
2 Your people.	Oh  you mean black people!

1 That's not how I meant it.  For all you know, you might just be a flash in the pan! You can never tell.	Hey fuck you! I deserve this shit. You're just jealous 'cause it ain't happening to you!

1 Do you know what he's saying?	What who's saying?
2 Manzanita....  ... if one day I die, and you read this piece of paper, I want you to know how much I love you. Although I'll never see you again, Gypsy, Gypsy, your hair, your hair, your face, your face'

1 Wow. Congratulations. I hate that asshole.  Thanks for coming. I guess I just wanted to find out how you're 	What's that about?
2 Forget it.

1 See you later.	Thanks

1 So keep painting.	Yes, Boss.  If you're so smart, why are you here with me in this basement?
2 You're news. I want the scoop. I write it down. When I speak, no one believes me. But when I write it down, people know it's true.  There's never been a black painter in art history that's been considered really important, you know?	So what?
3 So shut up and keep painting..	What time is it?
4 5:11.

1 Man, I was up on him years ago on the IRT.	You're selling and ending the culture. Not one bit of information. Only to get the money and growl with the power, man.
2 That's ignorant.

1 How could you?  I'm a woman...	I'm -- sorry, I --

1 I think you're jealous that I'm a genuine freak, and you have to wear a mask!	Maybe you're right.

1 I'm sure he's wonderful company and all, but ... doesn't the gold- plated bachelor bit get a little ... stale?	Somewhat like the lonesome secretary syndrome, I'd suppose.
2 Executive Assistant.  Secretary.  Girlfriend?	Had one.  Didn't work.
3 What went wrong?  Hang on, I think I know ... You kept things from her.	Nope, I told her everything.
4 And the truth frightened her?	Well ... How can I put this. There were two truths ... and she had trouble reconciling them. Because <u>I</u> had trouble reconciling them.  Vicki said.
5 "Vicki."  Ice-skater, or stewardess?	Photojournalist.
6 Sure.

1 I'd offer you coffee, but my assistant is using her vacation time.	Good time, too.  Everyone but the bandits seem to be slacking off till after New Years'.

1 Are you perchance a registered voter?  I'm also a mayoral prospect.	I have but one pet cause, today: Ban The Bat.
2 Oh, him again.  He's already history -- check it out.

1 Ten, nine...	The Christmas Eve of Destruction -- !
2 ... eight, seven...	Silent night, violent night...
3 All is shrill, all is blight...

1 Wonder if it's worth my time.	We need signatures.  To overturn the ballot.  I can supply those, Oswald.
2 I could teach her my "French flipper" trick...	Oswald:  We need one more thing.
3 A platform?  Lemme see ... Stop global warming.  Start global cooling.  Make the world a colder place.  <u>Frigid</u> ...	That's fine, Oswald.  But to get the Mayor recalled, we still need a catalyst, a trigger, an incident. Like the Reichstag fire, the Gulf of Tonkin.
4 "You're doin' great, Mayor Cobblepot."  "Your table is ready, Mayor Cobblepot."  "I need you, Oswald.  I need you now.  That's the biggest parasol I ever --"

1 It's our secret.  Honest.  How can you be so mean to someone so meaningless?	I must protect my interests, Ms. Kyle.  And Interest Number One, is <u>moi</u>.

1 Find my brother Wilfred.  Give him This.  I have duties he must fulfill in my stead.  Only family can be trusted.	What is it?
2 It is the hearts of two good men whom I have had the honor of calling son.  Take it, child.  But I implore you, never open it.  You look so like your mother.

1 I am as well as can be expected.	Alfred, I know you're sick -- I can get you the best doctors.
2 I've seen the best doctors--! A gentleman does not discuss his health.  It's not civilized.  I hope I've taught you at least that much, young man.

1 I'm on break from-	Oxbridge Academy?
2 Their new computer sciences division.  How did you know?	I recognized the accent.

1 This is easy.	Crimefighter's rule number one: never say that.
2 Why?

1 ... A giant drilling truck burrowing under the city ...	Mr. Freeze.
2 The batcomputer tracks him heading for the Gotham Museum.	The new antiquities exhibit.  The Second Sun of the Sudan.
3 Of course.  He's going to steal the giant white diamond.	No, Robin.  He's going to jail.

1 Remember the victim at the airport. Toxins introduced through the mouth.	What are you talking about?
2 Why is she so desperate to kiss us? I'm betting her lips are poison.	A poison kiss?  You have some real issues with women, you know that?  You just couldn't stand that she was about to kiss me.  Couldn't stand that something might be mine and not yours.  Could you?!

1 And?	Can I get some help over here?

1 I got the diamond.  Quell problemo, Bruce?	You left your back wide open.  Freeze could have killed you.

1 My reserves are exhausted.  I must have the gems that power my suit.	You are looking unseasonably hot. Let's go inside and grab your rocks.

1 Freezy, I'm feeling...hot.	I find that unlikely.
2 Okay, my hair is brittle, my skin is dry and I don't care.  I'd weather blizzards to have you. You're the most perfect man I've ever known.	To be frozen.  To never change.  A life of perpetual ice-olation. There is little perfection in that.
3 What say we turn up the heat?	You're skating on thin ice.  My passion thaws for my bride alone.
4 Forget your frosty femme.  These lips are wet and ready to get frostbite.	Hop away little bunny.  Before I cool your jets.  Permanently.

1 The dreams again, sir?	I think they're getting worse.
2 It's a wonder you sleep at all.

1 Why do I keep doing this?	Why, indeed?
2 Could I let Batman go? For Dick. For me. Could I leave the shadows? Have a life. Friends. Family...	Dr. Meridian...

1 Up here, Al.	Just checking, young sir.
2 Four seconds from...

1 Death.  Death. Without taste, sound and all around us.  Because there is no way for me to save them or myself. This is one giant death trap.	Excellent. See. Who says a guy in a rubber suit can't be smart? Well, it's been grand. Sorry you all have to die now.

1 Psychiatrists make you nervous?	Just ones this beautiful.
2 The infamous Wayne charm. Does it ever shut off?	On occasion. Usually at night.

1 A lot of what happened is jagged. Pieces missing. I can't really remember. I just get flashes. Usually in my dreams. I'd kind of gotten used to them. At least accepted them....	And now....
2 They've changed. The dreams, I mean. There's a new element I don't understand. A book. Black. Covered in leather....

1 Okay. I'm outta here.	Excuse me.
2 I figure telling that cop I'd stay here saved me a truckload of social service interviews and good will. So no offense but thanks. See ya.

1 I really do apologize, Mr. Wayne. His project was terminated this morning...	Let me ask you something, Bruce. What is man's greatest tool?

1 Yet so bright and chipper and conservative!  It's so you.  And yet so _you_!  Very few people are both a summer _and_ a winter. But you pull it off nicely.	A man with a death wish.
2 Harvey. You need me. Since you've gotten out of Arkham, you've managed, what? To bungle stealing a safe? Wreck a statue? And, correct me if I'm wrong here, but weren't you outsmarted by an acned acrobat at the circus?	Let's see if you bleed green.

1 A-14.	Miss.

1 You know, we should've sat down and had us a little heart-to-heart. I bet we would have got on famously.	... Murderer...
2 Bruce, we're both murderers. Think how many people you've killed by letting me live.

1 Thank you, Vicki.	... Where are you taking me?

1 "This is Miss Vale." -- That felt redundant.	You're just back from Corto Maltese.  I saw your combat photos.  Quite a departure for you.

1 But it's not fair.  I'm half drunk and you're not even --	I'll take you home if you'd like.
2 God.  You would.  Come on, Bruce.  I just want to get two drinks in you.  As an experiment.	Maybe we should just kiss.
3 ... We could try that.

1 Oh, Bruce. Don't tell me you carry it around with you.	I feel naked without it.

1 Boss! Jesus! They've --	They'll be sorry. They'll be sorry. MOVE OUT!

1 Okay, a break-in.  Trash the office, make off with the books ... "Industrial espionage."	Very good idea, Jack.  In fact --  -- I'd like you to handle this operation personally.

1 ... Thank you.	Unfortunate, but I think we can work around it.

1 No.	Well, I'm starving.  Will you at least buy me a hamburger?

1 You are on drugs.	Yeah?  According to this, he's in Geneva from '76 to '79. Well, I called Geneva.  Nobody there's even heard of the guy - - Probably off in Tibet with some kung fu master.
2 Are they paying you for all this?	Everybody needs a hobby.  You explain it, Vicki.  He walks out on his own party.  Half an hour later, who turns up?  Batman.  Sees an execution, freaks out in an alleyway.  No place to change.
3 Allie, I know exactly why you're doing this.	... Oh?  Why is that, Vicki?

1 Do we know anything about him?	Ahm - he's male.  He's English.  He's a doctor of er ... at least 2 things.  I think they would have mentioned if he was a blind dwarf.  Or one of those guys who kills lots of people all the time.  I think we're looking at someone moderately normal here.
2 David - are you ever going to learn to say 'no'?	Yes.  Yes.  Sometime.

1 Shut up, Kevin.  Honey, you-re not making sense ...	It's okay.  There's no one out here. Just open the door.  Trust me.

1 He's not too bad.  I can live with him.	I'm afraid you don't know the half of it. Sit down.  I have a tale to tell.  And not a happy one.

1 Oh Jesus.  Oh God.  Oh Jesus God.  Oh Mary Mother of Jesus. Oh Jesus of Nazareth.	oh dear.
2 What happened?!!!	Ahm.... .

1 Look at all this - publicity expenditure ... catering ... all completely fictional ... back as far as June 93 ...	I don't think you really understand what you're looking at ...

1 Oh, look, I mean, it's kind of the last thing... I mean, I'd really like to, but... things at home are kind of sensitive, so I couldn't really er ...	I thought perhaps as Vice-President, and in view of the unfortunate attendance's for the summer show this year... the MASSIVE financial LOSS ...
2 on the other hand ... maybe a breath of fresh air is just what my family needs ... Yes.  Great news.  Fabulous.  Triumphant.  Course it might need a little smoothing over.  When's he due?

1 David, David, David ...	I'm fired?  Because I let a... copy of a painting the get stolen?
2 Of course not.  I'm sacking you for neglectful conduct, relating to the heavy financial loss this gallery has incurred, through your recent lack of professional judgement.  A loss I trust Bernie will be able to reverse.

1 You've known me five years Elmer. When do you get to calling me David?	Not my place, sir.  It would only be a matter of time before I'm calling you Dave.  Then where would we be?  By next year, you're my Sweety-Pie" and I'm "Coochie-Coo".  I'11 be back in 15.

1 Interesting suit.	Why thank you sir.
2 off the peg?	Yes it is ... may I introduce you To Bern ...

1 What a dork. Huh huh.	Yeah, heh heh. He's a anus. Heh heh.

1 Uh, huh huh, this is Las Vegas?	Yeah, heh heh. I thought there'd be casinos and lights and stuff.

1 Ow, let go, Butt-Head!	Huh huh huh.

1 Dammit, all they have is shows about water.	That sucks. Heh heh. They need some shows about fire! Change the channel.
2 Uh...

1 Hey Butt-Head, isn't there supposed to be like, water in cactuses?	Uh...

1 Uh... Attention, attention! We're looking for that chick with the big boobs.	Heh heh. We wanna do her now!

1 Yeah, heh heh. Boooooiiiing!!!	Just make sure it looks like an accident...
2 Yeah, heh heh. I think I just had an accident. Heh heh hmm heh hmm heh.	Huh huh. You guys are funny. Let's have a drink on it.

1 ...Two...	...o-o-o-eieee-ooooeeeooooo...
2 Thrr...

1 Okay, boys and girls, our suspects are on a tour bus we believe to be headed for...  the White House! Jumpin' Jesus! I want everyone there. Our people. Locals. Orders are shoot to kill. Repeat! Shoot to kill!	Chief, I swear, we tore that bus apart. They couldn't have...
2 Bork, when this is all over, remind me to make you an appointment with Agent Hurley.

1 One more thing. Mah wife's got this leather satchel. It's black, about this big. I need ya to bring it back. It's real important. Sentimental value... Any questions so far?	Uh, yeah. Does she have big hooters?
2 She sure does.	This is gonna be cool! Huh huh huh.

1 Shut up, dumb-ass! You didn't score. I scored with both of them...	Uh, do you think these two sluts still live in Highland? That would be cool.
2 Hey, you wanna see something really cool? Huh huh huh.

1 We should be flattered that she wants to sell our house.	I know... I just wish she'd leave us alone.
2 Let's not think about it.  We'll have a nice romantic, quiet, vacation.  Here comes the bridge chorus.

1 Cabin fever, hon?	I can't clean anything.  The vacuum is out in the garage.  I can't leave the house.  Why don't they tell us something?  Where are all the other dead people in the world?  Why is it just you and me?
2 Maybe this is heaven.	In heaven there wouldn't be dust on the wallpaper.
3 Hon... I didn't want to die, but really, this is fine with me.  As long as I never have to wash dishes again.	Dishes?  We haven't eaten in three weeks!  Adam, I'm not like you, I really need to be around <u>people</u>, get out to the church and go grocery shopping.
4 But I'm not hungry, are you?

1 That's it?  No number, or instructions?	Nothing.  The bio buster?  I don't get it...

1 Well, I don't know... We don't get many visitors.	Where are your skulls and bones?
2 You know you're really a pretty girl.

1 Honey, I think that was a mistake.	I am not going to expose that little girl to that... pervert down there.
2 But <u>we</u> let him out.	I don't care, I've changed my mind.  ... I feel <u>really</u> confident.  We're getting better at this stuff.  We can scare them off ourselves -- tonight!  I've got an idea.  You're going to love it... I'm going to hate it.

1 A... Are you the guys who're hiding out in the attic?	We're ghosts.

1 We studied all day yesterday. Don't tell me...	I got an A!

1 Are you available?	No.  What's wrong?

1 You lilly-livered bleeding hearts!	I'm so sorry we frightened you. What were you doing?

1 Tell the truth.	I always tell the truth.  Of course I can see you.

1 Cookie, they are dead, dead, deadski.	Of course they're dead.  They're ghosts.
2 No, I mean they've gone. Decamped.  Split.  Vanished.	Where'd they go?
3 The happy hunting ground.  Who cares?	Are you a spirit too?
4 Sort of.  High spirit.  Heh heh. Listen, cookie, I've been trapped in this burg for hundreds of years.  All I want is to get out.	I want to get in.
5 You do?  Over here?  On <u>my</u> side?	I think so.
6 Well, yes, of course.  It's great over here.  You'll meet all the greats.  James Dean.  Buddy Holly.  'The little things a you say and do... make me want to be with you-a-hoo.'	Well, it can't be any worse than my life here.
7 That's right.  They treat you like scum I bet?	Yeah.
8 I can't help you from this side, but here's how we do it.  So <u>simple</u>.  Say my name three times. That's all.  I'll be all yours. Then I'll bring you over here in style.	I... I don't know what your name is.
9 Minor problem.  The rules.  I can't tell it to you.  But... do you know how to play charades?	Yes.
10 Of course you do.

1 Otho, you've got to help me get Maxie Dean up here.  I have a deal that could make all of us very comfortable.	He's a cloven-hooved beast!
2 He's your cousin.	I am ashamed to say he is.  Look, nothing short of giving away free sacks of money would get him up here, Charles.  And Sarah?  Forget it.  You can't get her out of Bergdorf's with plastic explosives.

1 Where is your mother?	Stepmother.  She's out torturing the movers.
2 Lydia.  Try to be civil.  I'm going to see if I can set up a noise-free zone in the study.

1 I'll bring the wine... and the business plan.  And Lydia you'll bring the ghosts.	I can't <u>bring</u> the ghosts.  They're not here!
2 Otho, could you actually... do something with them?

1 Don't you <u>dare</u>.	I saw some ghosts.

1 Blue-green!  Hydrated chromic oxide!  Remember I'm schooled in chemistry.  I was a hair analyst! Briefly.  Interior design is a <u>science</u>, Delia!  Think of me as Doctor Otho.  And this patient is truly <u>sick</u>!	Of course, her favorite color! How <u>beautiful</u>!

1 What's happening to them?	I don't know.

1 Wait a minute!  What am I worried about?  Otho, you can't even change a tire!	I'll need something personal of theirs.

1 I swear, Chauncey, between you and Benjamin, I've got my hands full...  ... Say, that is coming along, the swelling has gone down considerably...  ... Any pain here?	Yes, Robert. But it's not bad.

1 And you, Benjamin, must be strong and brave for me. Turn over, please.	In a minute, Robert - in a minute... Chauncey, I would like to ask a favor of you...

1 Do you know Raphael?	No sir, I don't believe I do.
2 Oh. I have a message for him.	Yes, sir.
3 A Black man gave me the message.	Well, I still don't believe I know the man, Mr. Gardiner. Now, hold still.

1 Did you lose something?	Yes. I lost my remote control.
2 Oh... Well, I'm very sorry...

1 ... Chauncey... Last night you mentioned an old man, that died.	Yes.
2 Was he a relative? Or an intimate friend?	He was a very wealthy man, he looked after me since I was young.
3 Oh, I see... Your mentor, perhaps?	... Mentor...?

1 ... I'm grateful to you, Chauncey... I would have opened to you with a touch, and you know that...  ... But you're so strong - I can trust myself with you. I'm glad, Chauncey - I'm glad that you showed so much restraint...	Yes, Eve. I'm very glad that you didn't open.
2 I know you are, Chauncey...  ... You conquer a woman from within herself, you infuse in her the need and desire and the longing for your love.	Yes. That could be true.
3 ... I guess I may as well be honest about my feelings, Chauncey, as I know you are I am in love with you... I love you and I want you... And I know that you know it and I'm grateful that you've decided to wait until... Until...

1 I see. Then one more quick question, Mr. Gardiner; since we at the Post would like to, uh - update our profile on you - what exactly is your business?	I have nothing more to say.

1 Yes, Eve. That would be good.	We must speak again, Mr. Gardiner, many times!
2 Thank you.

1 No, Ben.	Reluctant to speak, eh, Chauncey? Well, I can understand that. When a man loses everything, anger has a tendency to block out reason for a time. Just give it some thought, work with the idea, I'm sure you'll have plenty to say in a few days.
2 I could give it some thought, Ben, but my leg is very sore.	... Oh?  Robert, take a look, would you?

1 Mr. Gardiner, I'm Ronald Stiegler, of Harvard Books.	Hello, Ronald.
2 Mr. Gardiner, my editors and I have been wondering if you'd consider writing a book for us? Something on your political philosophy. What do you say?	I can't write.
3 Of course, who can nowadays? I have trouble writing a post card to my children! Look, we could give you a six figure advance, provide you with the very best ghostwriter, research assistants, proof readers...	I can't read.
4 Of course not! No one has the time to read! One glances at things, watches television...	Yes. I like to watch.
5 Sure you do! No one reads!... Listen, book publishing isn't exactly a bed of roses these days...	What sort of bed is it?

1 Good day, Mr. Chance.	Good day, Sally.

1 ... Hmmm... Elevator.	... Yes sir - elevator!

1 Don't we need a leader capable of guiding us through the seasons? The bad as well as the good?	Yes. We need a very good gardener.

1 Those trees were very young when I first arrived.	Are you related to the deceased, Mr. Chance?
2 No, I don't think so. And I have planted and shaped all the hedges, and in the springtime you will be able to see my flowers.

1 Yes. It has.	... You will honor me and my family with a visit, won't you?
2 Yes. I will.	Wonderful, we'll all look forward to seeing you.  Is Eve around? I'd like to say hello.

1 And look who you brought with!	Sophie, this is Chauncey Gardiner...
2 Oh, I've been just dying to meet you, Mr. Gardiner!	Chauncey, this is Mrs. Sophia Rowley.

1 But... Where was this man Gardiner before last week?	Apparently the White House shares our curiosity - they have also launched an investigation, and, according to our sources, neither the F.B.I. nor the C.I.A. has met with success.
2 I see. Clearly, such interest on their part is of great political significance.	Clearly, yes comrade.
3 Hmmm... Take this down.  I want this quote included in the Tass coverage; 'Chauncey Gardiner, in an intimate discussion with Ambassador Skrapinov, noted that "Unless the leaders of the opposing political systems move the chairs on which they sit closer to each other, all of their seats will be pulled from under them by rapid social and political changes."'	Very good, Your Excellency.

1 ... There is no longer any margin for inflation, it has gone as far as it can, you've reached your limits on taxation, dependence on foreign energy has reached a crisis, and, from where I see it, Mr. President, the Free Enterprise System has reached the breaking point. We are on the brink of another crash from which recovery might not be possible.	It's that serious, huh?
2 I'm afraid so.

1 Oh, thank you! Thank you! Thousand times, thank you!	Tell your friends.
2 Oh, I will, and I have many, many friends and associates, my friend. All, by the way, in Overeaters Anonymous. All of them fat and alone like me, all of them dream of being someone else, all of them with John Malkovich as their second choice!

1 I'll meet you on the turnpike.	I'm scared.

1 You were him last night, weren't you?	Yes.
2 And he was with her.	We love her, Craig. I'm sorry.
3 We?	Me and John.
4 Don't forget me.	Well, you have the Maxine action figure to play with.

1 Mr. Malkovich, my name is Craig Schwartz. I can explain. We operate a little business her that... simulates, for our clientele, the experience of... being you, actually.	Simulates?
2 Sure, after a fashion.	Let me try.
3 You? Why I'm sure it would pale in comparison to the actual experience.	Let me try!

1 Imagine a room full of women. Nubile, blonde, wet with desire, Schwartz. A harem, if you will. Me in leather. A harness, if you like. I am the object of this desire, and all eyes are on me as I speak. Ladies, I begin. I am the love god, Eros. I intoxicate you. My spunk is to you manna from heaven...	Dr. Lester, it's been really fascinating, but I'm afraid I have to get home to my wife now.
2 Wife, huh? I'd love to meet her, Craig.	Yessir.
3 Shall we say dinner on Friday. Just the two of us?  You can come too if you like, Schwartz.	That's sounds fine, sir. Gotta run.

1 That's the usual?	Dont let the girly shit fool you. It'd blow your shorts off.

1 Craig, I just don't find you attractive. And, Lotte, I'm smitten with you, but only when you're in Malkovich. When I looked into his eyes last night, I could feel you peering out. Behind the stubble and the too-prominent brow and the male pattern baldness, I sensed your feminine longing peering out, and it just slew me.	My God.

1 So that's the story of 7 1/2. Since the rents are considerably lower this floor has been adopted by businesses which for one reason or another are forced to cut corners After all... the overhead is low! Ha ha ha!	Ha ha ha!

1 Floris, get Guinness on the phone.	Gehginnis ondah foam?
2 Forget it.	Fork ah did?
3 Fine woman, Floris. I don't know how she puts up with this damn speech impediment of mine.

1 Aaaahhhh, the portal!	You bastard!

1 J.M. Inc. Be all that someone else can be.	I have to see you.
2 Sweetie! Oh, but we can't. It's business hours. I need to keep the membranous tunnel open for paying customers.

1 I'm sorry, did you just call me "Lotte"?	Do you mind?
2 No, I guess not. I'm an actor.

1 Shut up!  Sorry, dear, I lost control for a minute.	It's okay, my sweet.

1 Why you never go back to Lady Jone's and learn your letters? You liked going there I remember. Seeing the other children. Then all a sudden, you stop.	There was a boy there...said mama was a jailbird...said he could prove it..

1 ..I swallowed her blood right along with my mother's milk. She played with me and always came to be with me whenever I needed her. Me and her waited for our daddy. I love her. I do. She never hurt me. I love my mother but I know she killed one of her own, and tender as she is with me, I'm scared of her because of it. All the time, I'm afraid the thing that happened that made it all right to kill her own, could happen again. Whatever it is, it comes from outside this house, outside the yard. So I never leave this house and I watch over the yard so it can't happen again ... I have to keep it away from my sister...I'll protect Beloved...'Cause She's mine...	Beloved..She's mine       I am Beloved
2 and she is mine...

1 Your mother all right?	No. Not a bit all right. Hasn't gotten out of bed since that day.
2 You think I should stop by? Think she'd welcome it?	I don't know. I think I've lost my mother, Paul D.

1 DON'T LOVE HER TOO MUCH.	DO YOU FORGIVE ME?

1 Well, who can tell what went on in there? I never even knew who Sethe was or none of her people.	You know she married Baby Suggs' boy.
2 I ain't sure I know that. Baby never laid eyes on her till she showed up here. And how'd she make it and her husband didn't? And where is he? And how she have that baby in the woods by herself? Said a whitewoman help her. Shoot. You believe that? Well, I know what kind of white that was.	Aw, no, Ella.
3 Anything white floating around in the woods - if it don't got a shotgun, it's something the Lord tells me I don't want no part of.	You was friends.
4 Till she showed herself.	Ella.
5 I ain't got no friends take a handsaw to their own children.	What's any of that got to do with Paul D.?
6 What run him off? Tell me that!	I run him off.
7 You?	I told him...Showed him the newspaper. About Sethe. Read it to him. He left that very day.
8 You didn't tell me that. I thought he already knew.	He didn't know nothing. And nobody. Except her, from when they was at that place Baby Suggs was at.
9 He knew Baby Suggs?	Sure he knew her. Her boy Halle, too.
10 And he left when he found out what Sethe did?  What you say casts a different light on it, I guess...I thought-

1 What the hell you thinking, girl? Strolling in here this late?	Don't talk to me, Mr. Sawyer. Don't say nothing to me this morning.
2 What? What? You talking back to me?	I'm telling you don't say nothing to me.

1 Well, enjoy, and perhaps we'll see you again some time, Dude.	Yeah sure, if I'm ever in the neighborhood, need to use the john.

1 Jesus fucking Christ.	Crazy, huh?  Ran away a year ago.

1 What's this?	That is for the urn.
2 Don't need it.  We're scattering the ashes.	Yes, so we were informed.  However, we must of course transmit the remains to you in a receptacle.
3 This is a hundred and eighty dollars.	Yes sir.  It is our most modestly priced receptacle.

1 Almost five!	I got eighteen dollars, Dude.

1 How come you don't roll on Saturday, Walter?	I'm shomer shabbas.
2 What's that, Walter?

1 Are they gonna hurt us, Walter?	They won't hurt us, Donny.  These men are cowards.

1 I like your style, Dude.	Well I like your style too, man. Got a whole cowboy thing goin'.
2 Thankie. . . Just one thing, Dude. D'ya have to use s'many cuss words?

1 Brother Shamus?  Like an Irish monk?	Irish m--What the fuck are you talking about?  My name's Da Fino!  I'm a private snoop!  Like you, man!
2 Huh?

1 Jeez.  I miss vinyl.	Is he pretending to be the abductor?
2 Well...yeah--	Look, Jeffrey, you don't really kidnap someone that you're acquainted with.  You can't get away with it if the hostage knows who you are.
3 Well yeah...I know that.	So Dieter has the money?
4 Well, no, not exactly.  It's a complicated case, Maude.  Lotta ins. Lotta outs.  And a lotta strands to keep in my head, man.  Lotta strands in old Duder's--	Do you still have that doctor's number?
5 Huh?  No, really, I don't even have the bruise any more, I--

1 No, the, uh, police chief of Malibu. A real reactionary. . . So your father. . . Oh man, I get it!	What?

1 Smokey my friend, you're entering a world of pain.	Hey Walter--
2 Mark that frame an eight, you're entering a world of pain.

1 That...fucking...bitch!	It's all a goddamn fake.  Like Lenin said, look for the person who will benefit.  And you will, uh, you know, you'll, uh, you know what I'm trying to say--

1 We can't do that, Dude.  That fucks up our plan.	Well call them up and explain it to 'em, Walter!  Your plan is so fucking simple, I'm sure they'd fucking understand it!  That's the beauty of it Walter!
2 Wooden bridge, huh?	I'm throwing the money, Walter! We're not fucking around!
3 The bridge is coming up!  Gimme the ringer, Dude!  Chop-chop!	Fuck that!  I love you, Walter, but sooner or later you're gonna have to face the fact that you're a goddamn moron.
4 Okay, Dude.  No time to argue.  Here's the bridge--

1 Walter--	Who's got a fucking million fucking dollars parked in the trunk of our car out here?
2 "Our" car, Walter?	And what do they got, Dude?  My dirty undies.  My fucking whites--Say, where is  the car?

1 Is this your homework, Larry?	Look, man, did you--
2 Dude, please!. . .  Is this your homework, Larry?	Just ask him if he--ask him about the car, man!

1 Fuck you.  Fuck the three of you.	Hey, cool it Walter.

1 What about that shit about Vietnam!	Dude, I'm sorry--
2 What the fuck does Vietnam have to do with anything!  What the fuck were you talking about?!

1 Well sir, it's this rug I have, really tied the room together-	You told Brandt on the phone, he told me.  So where do I fit in?
2 Well they were looking for you, these two guys, they were trying to--	I'll say it again, all right?  You told Brandt.  He told me.  I know what happened. Yes?  Yes?
3 So you know they were trying to piss on your rug--	Did I urinate on your rug?
4 You mean, did you personally come and pee on my--	Hello!  Do you speak English?  Parla usted Inglese?  I'll say it again. Did I urinate on your rug?
5 Well no, like I said, Woo peed on the rug--	Hello!  Hello!  So every time--I just want to understand this, sir-- every time a rug is micturated upon in this fair city, I have to compensate the--
6 Come on, man, I'm not trying to scam anybody here, I'm just--	You're just looking for a handout like every other--are you employed, Mr. Lebowski?
7 Look, let me explain something. I'm not Mr. Lebowski;  you're Mr. Lebowski.  I'm the Dude.  So that's what  you  call me.  That, or Duder. His  Dudeness.  Or El Duderino, if, you know, you're not into the whole brevity thing--	Are you employed, sir?
8 Employed?	You don't go out and make a living dressed like that in the middle of a weekday.
9 Is this a--what day is this?	But I do work, so if you don't mind--
10 No, look.  I do mind.  The Dude minds. This will not stand, ya know, this will not stand, man.  I mean, if your wife owes--	My wife is not the issue here. I hope that my wife will someday learn to live on her allowance, which is ample, but if she doesn't, sir, that will be her problem, not mine, just as your rug is your problem, just as every bum's lot in life is his own responsibility regardless of whom he chooses to blame.  I didn't blame anyone for the loss of my legs, some chinaman in Korea took them from me but I went out and achieved anyway. I can't solve your problems, sir, only you can.

1 We know the briefcase was empty, man.  We know you kept the million bucks yourself.	Well, you have your story, I have mine.  I say I entrusted the money to you, and you stole it.

1 Yeah, but--	Am I wrong!?
2 Yeah, but I wasn't over.  Gimme the marker, Dude,  I'm marking it an eight.

1 Two years.	Then they weren't created to go after your "patient zero".
2 No.  They've been training to hunt you.

1 I've never seen anything like this.  The Reapers are as different from us as we are from you.  It's almost as if the virus is re-wiring their bodies, creating new, parasitic organs which consume the old ones.	Like cancer with a purpose.
2 Exactly.  Look at the digestive system. It's been drastically simplified.  Super charged.  And this --

1 It means "bloodbrother."	I don't understand.

1 Where were you, Whistler?	I'll show you.

1 Put it back in park, Blade.	Thought you were dead.
2 Seems like there's a lot of that going around these days.

1 What's going on?	He was here.  Watching us.
2 Nomak?	He wants us to know he's hunting us now.

1 We're locked in.	Are you insane?  He'll kill us both!
2 Maybe it's better that way.

1 The hell are you fiddling with there?	Tweaked the phosphor rod, modified the collimated beam, wanna concentrate the light, get something like a UV laser going.
2 You're wasting your time, already been tried.	Yeah, but you didn't have the Scudster working on it, did you?
3 Nope.  Back then we did not.	So how long have you known Blade, anyway?
4 Going on twenty years now.	Blade doesn't talk about the old days much.
5 Blade doesn't talk about anything much.  What about you, though?

1 Going somewhere?	China Town. I need more serum.  What's all this?

1 You're too human, Blade.	It's because I'm human that I can do this.

1 I can go to the police. I have blood samples back at the hospital. I can show them.	Do it. You'll be dead before you can file the complaint.
2 That's ridiculous! No one's that powerful.

1 Looks like we hit pay-dirt. This place is crawling with them.  See the valets over there? They're vampires. So is the doorman.	How can you tell?
2 The way they move, they way they smell --

1 You care about him, don't you?	We've got a good arrangement, that's all. Whistler makes the weapons, I use them, the vampires die -- end of story.

1 I never imagined I'd be so happy to see the sun rise --  It's over, isn't it?	For them. But for me --

1 Five minutes, not a second more. And I don't want to hear a word about "us".	No problem.

1 How do you like that? Right on time.	The other elders will never let you get away with this!

1 Consider it a parting gift. Vampire mace -- silver nitrate, essence of garlic.	So that's it? You guys just patch me up and send me on my way?
2 There is one other thing. I'd buy yourself a gun if I were you. If you start becoming sensitive to the daylight, if you start becoming thirsty regardless of much you've had to drink -- then I suggest you take that gun and use it on yourself. Better that, than the alternative.

1 All right, let's start with the basics -- why do vampires need to drink blood?	Their own blood can't sustain hemoglobin.
2 Then vampirism is a genetic defect, just like Hemolytic anemia?

1 Not that I can see.	Closer. Lift the lid and look-- it hurts.

1 Shit? This is from "Josh's Blair Witch Mix," man!	Down or off--you're giving me a migraine.
2 Christ.

1 Yeah, so?	So whoever built this--

1 Jesus.	What?
2 That's not whatzername--it's Mary Brown.

1 --or someone--	--scared the living shit out of us.

1 I want to see something!	Whatever you want.
2 The clothes--take 'em off-- I want to see every square inch--	--no, what's wrong with you?

1 So, I hear you're from New Mexico!	Sometimes.

1 Okay, a blur.	Can you zoom it or something, make it real close, real big?
2 I'm the ebay Boy, remember? I can't exactly afford that kind of equipment.	Who do you know who can? Where do we go?

1 You're not only an idiot, you're a goddamn <u>child</u>.	Why does everyone here but me have have a gigantic stick up their ass?

1 Used to be a meat-packing plant. Slaughter on the ground floor-- carcasses schlepped up on this thing for dissection and grinding and--	--Cotter: shut up.
2 What?

1 Cotter?	Fucking owl!
2 You think it's possible the tree in the Parr foundation is the same one they tied Elly Kedward to?	No idea--goddamitt!

1 That's a "j."	For "James?"
2 Goes right along with these two.

1 You drive, I'll handle the video, okay?	Fine.

1 403 41st Street, kids: home.	I dunno it's safe to even get out of the car.
2 By day? No sweat.

1 Chrissake: why <u>any</u> of this?	I think it's time to get out of here.

1 --sacred and occult Scotch Tape.	Rusty Parr had the right idea on child care.

1 What'd you see?	Motion. Stop there. Play it again.

1 You gonna be alright?	Sure. I'm sorry.
2 No big deal. I'm just trying to understand.	Get some more beer.
3 I think you closed the bar again. I'll have to go out.	Go to the store. When you get back, I'll try to make sense of it for you.

1 Domini's the only logical explanation.	We're not dealing with fucking logic here!

1 Good morning, Sheriff's Office.	Yes! I need to speak to Sheriff Von Teer.
2 He's in a meeting. Could I have him--	--it's urgent!
3 Could I tell him what it's regarding?	His daughter, for God's sake-- I need to know if he's heard from her this morning.

1 ...I mean, I don't know where he is, but he ain't dead.	Meurice--
2 You don't look too good. You sleep last night?

1 ...He sent me to a psychiatrist to see if he could calm me down some.	Yeah? What happened?
2 Psychiatrist said I was the healthiest person he'd ever met, so Marty fired him.	...I don't know if you can fire a psychiatrist, exactly.
3 Well, I didn't see him anymore, I'll tell you that much.

1 ...I just wanted to let you know that everything was all right. I took care of everything. Now all we have to do is keep our heads.	...What do you mean?

1 ...You leaving?	Isn't that what you want?

1 He needs a room, Dusty.	I reckon I can hear him...  ...Room rate's eight sixty-six a day plus sales tax, plus extra for the TV option.

1 Then what'd you come here for?	You owe me for two weeks.

1 So, uh... this wouldn't interest you.	I didn't say that. All I said was you're an idiot. Hell, you been thinking about it so much it's driving you simple.

1 ...Count it if you want.	Nah, I trust ya.

1 ...Why?	You shouldn't have taken the money...

1 Frank. Come in.	Hey, I brought some friends. and some beer.
2 Fine. Welcome. Come sit down.

1 Jeffrey?	Yes?
2 If you want to come up a minute, I'll show you some pictures.

1 Hello, baby.	Shut up. It's daddy. shithead.
2 Hello, daddy.	. my bourbon.

1 GET OUT OF THERE!! GET OUT!! Put your hands up, on your head. GO ON!! Get down on your knees - DO IT!! What are you doing? Who are you? What's your name?. WHAT'S YOUR NAME?	Jeffrey.
2 Jeffrey. Jeffrey what?	Jeffrey nothing.
3 You tell me!! Let me see that wallet.  Jeffrey Beaumont. What're you doing in my apartment, Jeffrey Beaumont?	I wanted to see you.
4 What? Are you kidding me? Who sent you here?	Nobody.
5 Shit. You better tell me something.	I was. an experiment. Just to see if I could do it.
6 An experiment? Hey, I've seen you before.	I sprayed your apartment. I took your key. I really didn't mean to do anything but see you.
7 Tell me what you saw tonight. TELL ME.	. I saw you come in, talk on the phone. get undressed.
8 The phone. What did you hear on the phone . Tell me. Word for word.	You said hello. to Frank. You wanted to talk to someone?. Don?. and little Donny. You said something about Momma loves you. and something about a Meadow Lane. something in an hour. I don't remember any more.

1 You can hit me, if you want to.	No. please. I won't.

1 Oh God. Don!!! Why can't I just die.	There you go again. stop saying that. You can make it.
2 I can't. I can't. You think you know so much.	Take it easy. What's goin' on anyway?. Why are you in so much trouble?

1 Look, snap out of it, will ya?	Kiss me.

1 Shh. I'll tell you.	They hurt his head.
2 Who, Dorothy?	Don. help him. HELP HIM!! DONNY!!!!

1 Raymond! Where's the fuckin' beer?	Right here Frank. You want me to pour it?
2 No, I want ya to fuck it. Shit, yes. pour the fuckin' beer.	There ya go.
3 Good, let's drink up.

1 Alright, now tell me. What is it?	There are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience. sometimes, in some cases. it's necessary to take a risk. I got to thinking. I'll bet a person could learn a lot by getting into that woman's apartment. you know. sneak in and hide and observe.
2 You said it was a strange world. and you're the strangest part of it. Are you crazy.she is possibly involved in murder. This gives me the creeps.	Settle down. I have a plan which I think will work. There is very little for you to do, but I do need your help. .Aren't you curious about my plan?
3 It wouldn't hurt to hear the plan, I guess.	Alright. the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that I could crawl into later.
4 Now, how are you going to do that?	Right out in the car I happen to have some old overalls and a bug spraying rig. I will go to her apartment and be the pest control man. I will spray her apartment. After a few minutes you will knock on her door, drawing her attention away from me and I will then jimmy a window.
5 What will I say when she comes to the door?	You will be a Jehovah's Witness. I have a few "Awake" magazines for you. You don't have to keep her very long. a few seconds is all I'll need. Whatiya think?
6 I don't know. it sounds like a good daydream, . but actually doing it is too weird. too dangerous.	Let's just try the first part. If that goes well, we'll see about the rest. No one will suspect us, because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this.
7 You've got a point there.

1 Here's to. an interesting experience.	I'll drink to that.

1 Can I give you a kiss good night?	You better not, Jeffrey.
2 Okay. okay.	Goodnight.
3 See ya tomorrow.

1 You want to dance?	I can't dance fast.
2 Really?	Really. you want to dance with someone else?
3 NO.	Let's wait for some slow one.
4 Just a minute.

1 Looks like they've got you strapped in pretty good.	uh uh.
2 Are you feeling okay?	uh uh.

1 No.	Looks like you'd make a good runner.
2 Well.	I mean, you don't exactly have the build for a football. I mean. no offense.

1 Sandy? ...Sandy, please.	I'll get a coat for her.

1 Norman Cay is not a person.  He is an island, George.  In the Bahamas.  From what they say, it is free and it's Diego's new home.	What?

1 Are you sure this guy is cool?	You'll see for yourself.

1 You can't sell this to your friends.	Man.  Fuck you guys.  I have this great idea and you guys have to be all skeptical.
2 Look, if you really wanna score some dope, I got the guy.

1 What can I do for you guys?	We want some grass.
2 I know what you want.  But, first of all, are you cops?	No.
3 Because if you are, you have to tell me. If not, it's entrapment.	We're not cops.  We're from Massachusettes.  I mean, does he look like a cop?
4 I guess not.  Okay.  You know, you're very lucky you're friends of Barbie's. If you weren't, I'd never talk to you.

1 Happy Birthday, George.  Mirtha invited me.	Yeah.  She told me.
2 Look, I'm sorry about everything.  I feel like an idiot.  You were right.  I did fuck you.  And then Diego fucked me. Cut me out, too.	I heard.
3 I lost sight of everything.  Forgot who my friends were.	It's in the past.  I'm out of the business now, so forget about it.  No hard feelings.  We need to move on.  And besides, I'm sorry, too.
4 You?	For calling you a homo.
5 That was out of line.

1 What type of planes do you have?	Four passenger, single engine Cessna.
2 How many kilos can we fit in these planes?	I don't know.  A hundred, hundred and fifty.  How many miles is it from Colombia to Miami?
3 Fifteen hundred.  We'll have to stop somewhere to refuel.	We'll refuel in the Bahamas.  I know someone there.
4 Great.  I love the Bahamas.

1 Thirty-six hours.  I can't believe it. Everything is gone in thirty-six hours.	I think it's fair to say you underestimated the market there, Derek.
2 Touche.	But to the victor belong the spoils.

1 Nothing.  Todo esta bien.	Everything is not alright.  I bring you in, and you slap my fucking face!
2 This is not the time, Diego.

1 G-d, son.	Okay, Mom.  It's okay.  Where's Dad?

1 What do I think?  I don't want my answer to be influenced by what I want, so I'm going to have to say I don't know.	Yes.  I do not know, either.  What do you want, George?
2 I want money.	Yes.  Money.  Which is what, George?
3 Freedom.	Power?
4 Yeah, maybe.	Family.
5 Sure.	Beautiful girls?
6 Keep them coming.	Keep them coming?  Ah, yes.  Ha ha.  You are right.  But money.
7 Money.	And Diego?
8 Diego is my brother.

1 You're like your mother.  You love money.	Dad.
2 No, it's good.  You have a family.  It's good if it makes you happy.  It's nice to have nice things.  Are you happy, son?	Yeah, Dad.  I'm happy right now.

1 Don't be stupid, George.  We've got him. We've got him dead to rights.  But like I said, this is top priority so we're handing out free passes on this one. And the first one's got your name on it. Cut your sentence in half, maybe more.	No thanks, fellas.  You've got the wrong fucking guy.  I'm not a rat.

1 Hello.	Hello.
2 Do I know you?	I don't think so.
3 Why are you smiling?	Why are you smiling?
4 I don't know.  My name is George.	I know who you are, El Americano. Mister George.
5 What is your name?

1 What do you want?	You knew I was seeing Kristina, right?
2 Yeah.  She told me.  You walk her to school.	Yeah, so I've been thinking.  I love her, y'know?  I kind of want to have her.  I've been away for so long.  Make up for the missed time, you know?
3 I haven't seen one dollar from you.  You haven't paid me one cent in child support, alimony.	Yeah, well.  I'm working on that.  I've got something going.
4 Yeah?  I better see some money out of it.	Yeah, you will.  Of course.

1 Bye, Dad.  See you in the morning, okay?	I'll be here.

1 For instance, something like this?	Very nice.  I'll take it.
2 Ha ha ha.  You are funny.   Really, how much will you be needing?	All of it.  As much as you've got.  A couples thousand pounds.  I'll be back in a week with a plane.
3 Listen, Americano, it is very nice to meet you, but maybe we are going too fast.  You take a little and then come back.	I don't need a little.  I need a lot.
4 Marijuana is illegal in my country, and I believe in yours, as well.  We must be careful.	What if I brought you, let's say, fifty thousand dollars?  Would that eliminate some of your concerns?
5 Amigo, you bring me fifty-thousand dollars, and I have no more concerns.

1 Are we good?	Are we good?  Yeah, we're good.  We're beautiful.  We're perfect.  This is A grade, one-hundred percent pure Colombian cocaine, Ladies and Gentlemen. Disco shit.  Pure as the driven snow. Good riddance.

1 Colonel Mathieu ... Much has been said lately not only of the successes obtained by the paratroopers, but also of the methods that they have employed ... Can you tell us something about this?	The successes obtained are the results of those methods. One presupposes the other and vice versa.

1 And how many are we?	Not enough.

1 It's clear. They'll do everything possible to make it fail.	No, they'll do even more. We've given them the opportunity to do a lot more ... Do you understand what I mean? Starting tomorrow, they won't be groping in the dark any more; every shop and every worker who strikes will be a known enemy, a self-confessed criminal ... And they will be able to pass to the offensive. Have you thought of this?

1 You seem to be very satisfied to have taken me alive ...	Of course I am.
2 That proves that I was wrong. Evidently I credited you with an advantage greater than I should have.	No. Let's just say that you've given me the satisfaction to have guessed correctly. But from the technical point of view, it isn't possible to speak of advantages. By now the game is over. The NLF has been defeated.

1 I would have missed it -- but the phone rang and I let it play while I talked.  It looks like blank tape -- but it isn't.  It's been erased without any input signal coming in.	So, what good is it to us if it's been erased?
2 It's very good -- because when the D.A's office saw it they assumed it was the end of the tape, otherwise they would have buried it.	Why?
3 Because it hasn't all been erased.

1 I think I'm going to make your day.	How?

1 Did you ever see Mr. Marsh use cocaine?	No -- never.
2 Your witness.

1 Your Honor, this is a tape from Miss Lawson's answering machine.  I would like to play it now.	Objection.  Your Honor, we don't know where this tape is from.  Who made it -- or under what circumstances it was made.

1 Can I go?	You get his statement?

1 Mr. Roston, what was your relationship with Miss Lawson?	We were lovers.
2 How long were you together?	For about one year.
3 How would you describe your sex life with Miss Lawson?	Intense.
4 I know this is a very personal subject, but could you be a little more specific?	It was wild.  She was constantly trying to get me more and more worked up -- kinky things.  I tried to satisfy her the best I could, but it was difficult in my condition.
5 What kind of condition are you referring to?	I had a bad heart.

1 What kind of information?	She said that she was working on a novel and she wanted to know what kinds of drugs would be harmful to someone with a bad heart.

1 Dr. Trammel, did you ever speak to Miss Lawson about Mr. Marsh's condition?	No.
2 Did Mr. Marsh ever tell you that he had spoken to Miss Lawson about his illness?	No.
3 Did Miss Lawson ever accompany Mr. Marsh inside during his examinations?	No.
4 Then you have no way of knowing what Mr. Marsh told Miss Lawson were the reasons for his visits?	No.  No, I don't.

1 What happened next?	While I was seeing Dr. Paley I mentioned to him one night that someone was stealing drugs from the third floor dispensary.   Three days after I spoke to him in his office he went to the Head Nurse and told her he had witnessed me stealing drugs.
2 What happened?	There was an inquiry.  It was his word against mine.  They believed him.  I was fired.

1 Yes.	It must have been horrible.  Having to go there -- seeing them together - - knowing he was sleeping with her in the same bed he did with you.
2 I was jealous.  Of course I was hurt. He switched me off like a little toy he was finished playing with.  But I didn't kill him.

1 I'm gonna go to jail.  I know they're gonna make it look like I did it. They gotta put it on someone.	Why'd you come here?
2 To show you this.  It's a letter from that lawyer, Koehler.  He wrote it to me the day after I saw him.  He's the one who told me I could get the money if Miss Lawson went to jail.	You didn't know about it before that?
3 No.

1 I want you to know right now that the trial's going to be nasty.  Your sex life is going to be dragged through the mud.  They're going to say that you enticed Marsh -- led him down a dark path.	Andrew hardly needed leading.  He was a very passionate man.  He was eager to explore.  I gave him what he wanted.  We fulfilled each others needs.
2 This is a very small town -- people here have very straight views on sex.

1 What do you think?	I think the photographer's probably a voyeur.
2 I'm the photographer.	Oh -- Well, they're different.
3 That's not an answer.	It's not my taste.
4 Tastes can change.

1 I called you all weekend.  Where were you?	I went out on the boat.

1 You killed him -- didn't you?	I knew you were thinking that.  I could see it in your eyes today in the courtroom.  You're wrong, Frank. I need you to believe that.
2 You don't need anybody.	I do need you.  No matter what you think of me -- I didn't do it.

1 Alright, I'll talk to her	She's waiting in the conference room.

1 Miss Braslow, I'd like to remind you that you are still under oath.	How often do you use cocaine?

1 Is that alright, Frank?	Yeah -- fine.  Excuse me.  I'll be right back.

1 Don't use language like that at the dinner table.	Sorry.

1 I don't mind waiting.	Well, there's a lot of boring stuff to do. Lists of people we have to write to. Find mama's relatives addresses in Italy -- stuff like that.
2 Well, I can help.	I said NO!

1 I remember a Mrs. Delaney but Mama told me years ago she died.	Well, I don't care if it's legal or not, we're not cremating her and throwing her all over some bridge where we can't even go visit her because she's going to be blown all over the place like an ashtray.

1 Bar across the street.	Have you called Betty?  Maybe you should.
2 I found out who Lucy Delaney is.  Remember the Delaneys from Hillcrest Road?	Yeah. But I thought she died.
3 He remarried. Apparently they were having an affair for years. Apparently the first Mrs. Delaney was a bit of a stiff.	You mean -- she didn't like sex?
4 I bet mom could've helped her.	Boy. All these years I've resented not living the wild life in some place like Paris and all the time I could've moved back to Iowa... Are you drunk?
5 Not yet. You want to go?	I think I better. Between the book and the coffee, I'm this close to raping the busboy.

1 Madge. Please. Something's happened. I've met someone. I've fallen in love in a way I've never thought could happen my entire life. It's our last day together. I feel like I'm going to die when he leaves. Please. Help me.	Oh, honey. I'm so sorry. But you've got to be grateful for even feeling the little you've be given. Believe me. Go to him. Don't let him leave without these new precious hours you've got left. And if you need anyone to cry on, you know where I am.

1 This won't take long. I'm shooting tomorrow morning. I just need to do some prep work.	I don't mind waiting.

1 Sure you want to keep those in the house?	I'm so sorry about that. It was rude. I think I just got nervous for some reason.
2 I thought it was funny.

1 I didn't mean that the way it sounded.	Well, let's just call it a compliment and move on.  Did you love teaching?

1 My mistake. I apologize.	What made you ask such a question?
2 I thought that's what we were doing -- asking questions.	I thought we were just having a conversation. You seem to be reading all this meaning into it. Meanings I must be too simple to, uh... interpret or something.
3 I already apologized.

1 Take me somewhere.	What?
2 Right now. Tell me someplace you've been -- someplace on the other side of the world. Anywhere but here.	How about Italy?
3 Yes.	How about Bari?
4 Yes. Tell me about the day you got off the train.	Have you ever been to that station?
5 Yes.	You know that little place nearby with the striped awning that sells sandwiches and little pizzas...

1 Sleep all right?	Yes, thanks.
2 Good. More coffee?  Robert, I hope you don't mind my asking, but I feel like I should.	What?
3 Well, these... women friends of yours... all over the world. How does it work? Do you see some of them again? Do you forget others? Do you write them now and then? How do you manage it?

1 It's a Chicago station. I found it the other day.	Kinda pretty. Is this uh... jazz kinda singing?
2 I don't know. Can we turn it off? I have such a headache.	Sure.

1 Oh my God...!	What happened?
2 I was paying the check. She ran outside. I told her to wait for me right here! Oh God, where is she? Rebecca!

1 Your father was his best friend.  He loved Jeremiah.  So he must hate him the most of all now.  He'll take his time. But even if it is too late.  If your father is dead.  It's not over.  The door has to be closed.	Well, close the fucking door by all means.  But don't expect me to go down there and do it.
2 I don't.

1 Oh yeah, I guess this would be that space that was so perfect for a recording studio.	Maurice, man, shut the fuck up.

1 Shit.	Spooked?

1 That's what?	That's some terrible shit.
2 Clean your mouth, or I will.  Those boys had no business messing down there.  Go places you're not meant to be -- that's what you get.	But that's your old hood, Pops.
3 Yeah, and it took some doing to get out of there.  Just be glad I did and you can start life from here instead of down there.

1 No?  That mean there's something more left of you than just that hungry spirit? What are you going to do now?  Kill us? Kill us all?	No.  Not...not you.  You I forgive.

1 I don't understand it.  You were my Man. Since we was grasshoppas.  I always looked after you.  You had a piece of everything I had.	I didn't want a piece of yours, I wanted my own.
2 And the hell everybody else, right?

1 Told you so.  Alright.  We tried.  Let's go home.	Mother!  No.

1 I'm here.	Bill!  Bill?!
2 Patrick, he's...	Okay, okay.  Listen:

1 Listen to me, boy.  I didn't work all my life to get out of this neighborhood for you to move right back in!	I thought you'd be psyched.  Just trying to do what you did.  Take nothing and make something out of it.
2 No one'll ever come here.  Shut it down. Don't worry, the bank'll buy it back. I'll take care of it.	You'll take care of it?  Not this time. No way.  I bought it fair and square. And we open tonight.
3 Bullshit!  Bullshit!!  You're selling it back!  That's an order!

1 Not your style.  Is it Eddie?  Killing off your customers?	I ain't killed nobody.  Shall I rack 'em?  Play a game, Lupe?
2 No time for eightball.  I got your tip.

1 Jimmy Bones?	Yeah, you heard of him?
2 You haven't?	Not that I remember.
3 He was a local legend back in the '70's. There was a song, Stagolee kinda deal: "This is the ballad of Jimmy Bones/Black as night and hard as stone..."	I was born near here.  My dad's from here.  He never mentioned it.

1 You sure we oughta save him?  Why not just let see how safe his gates and walls keep him when his past comes calling?	Save him?  What are you talking about?

1 Glenlivet, right, Gino?	I'll have whatever Violet's drinking.

1 Caesar!	Gino, your son stole this money to set me up and I can prove it.  Violet!

1 Caesar, I'm leaving.	What?  Oh, come on, I didn't use one of the good towels.

1 Why?  Why would Johnnie do this?	Jesus Christ, Violet!  Open your fucking eyes!  Johnnie hates me like I hate him!

1 ...  maybe three hours.	Caesar, what are you going to do?
2 What do you think we're going to do? We have to find the money.	What?
3 Once we have the money, then none of this ever happened.	Caesar, you just killed Gino Marzzone.
4 No I didn't.  Not if his body disappears and not if the money is still here.  Then they never showed up.	What happened to them?
5 I don't know.  We may never know, but I'm going to guess it was a job, maybe the Karpoli family.

1 I saved you.	Ha!  What a load of crap.  Look at yourself, Caesar.  You're a thug. |You launder money for the mob.  You rent women like you rented this apartment.

1 Fuck, this happened before.  It's this shitty ear.  Born with it.  The batteries wore out in my aid.  I'm sorry.	It's all right, sir.

1 You can't kill me yet.	Why?
2 I could be lying.

1 Actually, yeah, she was nervous about Gino coming, wanted everything to look right.  You know women, Mick.	Sure, Cease.  They make us do stupid things, don't they.

1 Ma'am, you have to open the door.	All right.

1 I should be going.  You can drop the cup off anytime.	Thanks.
2 My pleasure.

1 You dropped that earring down the drain on purpose, didn't you?	If I say yes, will you take your hand away?
2 No.	...  yes.

1 Shelly was skimming from the business. He came to see me yesterday because he was afraid Caesar figured it out. He wanted to run but he wanted me to come with him.	Even though he knew about you?
2 Yes.	He was in love with you, right?
3 That's what he told himself.  But it wasn't even about me, it was about Caesar.  He wanted what Caesar had. That's how they are.  I understand them.

1 You said he washed the money?	Yeah.
2 Then what?  Exactly.	He hung it up.
3 What?	To let it dry.

1 We want him to come down, to relax, feel in control again.	Poor boy, has to work so hard.

1 Jesus, that's beautiful.	Thank you.
2 If you're this goddamn smart, how did you ever get caught?	Every job like this has moments where things don't go so well and everyone starts thinking about their own ass. It's in those moments that everything comes together or falls apart.

1 Done.  We go now.	Jesus Christ, Pop.  You got two hours until your plane leaves.

1 She's a gypsy.  If it's a cover, it's a great one.	I'm assuming we're exploring that possibility.
2 We're exploring <u>every</u> possibility.  We are in pursuit.  How much more do you want me to tell you?	Pursuit would indicate that you know exactly where he is.
3 No.  Pursuit <u>ends</u> when we know exactly where he is.	Yes, well, I think we need some fresh eyes on this problem.  I'm bringing in some people from upstairs.

1 <u>What did you do to me</u>?	What did I do?  I spent thirty million dollars on you.  I spent three years finding you -- four years training you --  What did I do?  What in the name of God have you been doing, Jason?
2 I don't know.	They're right about you, aren't they?  You're fried.  You really don't know what's going on, do you?
3 I know you've been trying to kill me.	Of course.  We had to try.  We didn't know what was wrong.  We didn't know you were in trouble.
4 So now you know.	So it's time to go home.
5 That's all I get?	We'll make you better.  We can put the pieces back.  We can do that.
6 I don't think so.	We have to go home, Jason.
7 Jason Bourne is dead.	<u>There never was a Jason Bourne</u>.  You have to come with me.  It's the only way.  We can give it back to you...
8 Keep it. 	Jason...  They can't let you go...
9 That'll be their second worst mistake.

1 Well...  I must admit, when my assistant told me you were here I was, really -- I was quite -- I was surprised.	Really.
2 We thought you were gone for good.	Did you?
3 Well, I mean it's a tough business, isn't it?  Cutthroat.

1 Just so you know, if you're gonna burn me on the money, you might as well kill me.  I was supposed to have this car back three days ago.  It's not my car.	I know that.

1 I should go.	I don't remember any of this.
2 Jason...

1 You stayed there five times in the past six months.  But I didn't have time -- I could only get the bill from the last stay -- you were there for two days.  Some room service -- there's half a dozen phone calls here so that's someth--	Who paid the bill?
2 It's a company... MPG Capital.

1 xxxxxx	xxxxxx

1 Get in the basement.	What?
2 Get everyone down in the basement.

1 What the fuck is he doing?	Maybe it's a game.  Maybe he's trying to send us a message.
2 It doesn't matter now.  We've just got to be the first ones there.  Get everybody up.  I want them all activated.	All of them?

1 ...Be back.	Thank you.

1 ...ven't you?	You're putting your talents to very odd use Mr Lowry - yes, odd use - to pit wits against Central Services -
2 ...sod you, stupid twit.

1 And the cost of it all, Deputy Minister? Seven percent of the gross national produce ...	I understand this concern on behalf of the tax-payers. People want value for money and a cost-effective service.

1 Yes, it's all a bit confusing but, it seems she was killed resisting arrest.	No, no ... I did that...

1 But surely, I mean, perhaps she just happened to live above the Buttles, and ...	Look after that suit, eh. Barbara chose it for me.
2 Right. Er, you're not going to keep calling her Barbara, are you?	Barbara's a perfectly good name, isn't it?
3 Look, about the Layton woman - maybe she's just trying to help the Buttle family.	Why?
4 Why? Hell, not for any reason ...	{baffled) I don't follow you.
5 Out of kindness.	Kindness? What's the purpose behind this line of enquiry?
6 So what are you going to do about her?	Get her out of circulation - I've put her on the detention list.
7 You mean you're going to invite her in so that she can spill the beans inside the department?	Well, I ... Good point. What do you suggest?
8 Let me try to get to her. I'll deactivate her.	What does that mean? I don't want to be involved in anything unsavoury.
9 Trust me. You do trust me, don't you?	Of course. We went to school together. You're my oldest friend.
10 And you're mine.	You're the only person I can trust.
11 Then we'd better keep this business just between the two of us.	Right! Just between as and the Security Forces.
12 They weren't at school with us.	But, I've already put her on the search and detain list.
13 Take her off the list.	There's no procedure for that until she's been arrested.
14 Say it was a mistake.	We don't make mistakes.
15 Well, I'd better get out there and try to get to her before security does. Let me borrow her dossier for a while.	Er ... alright. For Christ's sake don't lose it. Here, you'd better sign for it.

1 Are you alright?	It's you ... it's you ...
2 Mrs Buttle, are you alright?

1 OK. What's in the parcel?	What parcel?

1 They're gone.	Are you sure?
2 Yes.

1 Problem. She doesn't have a bank account.	Well, that's it! I may as well go and hang myself! This sort of thing couldn't have happened before the stupid seventh tier reorganization! That was Simmons doing! And he and Jeffries always sit together at lunch! The bastards!  Ow!  Perhaps we can lose it ... behind the filing cabinet ... or destroy it ... burn it ... eat it ...

1 Sod it, it's broken!	You haven't switched it on.
2 Oh - yes. Look you're putting me off, standing there! Go back to your office and I'll give you a knock when I've finished.

1 What were we saying?	This isn't rare!
2 By the way, I saw a wonderful idea for Christmas presents at the chemists. Gift tokens. Medical gift tokens.

1 Whatever happened to you?	There was a slight complication. Dr. Chapman says it often happens with a delicate skin like mine. Nothing to worry about. He's promised me I'll have these bandages off in a ...
2 Actually, there's someone I want to meet ...	I know, I know ...!

1 Excuse me, Dawson, can you put me through to Mr Helpmann's office?	I'm afraid I can't, sir. You have to go through the proper channels.
2 And you can't tell me what the proper channels are, because that's classified information?	I'm glad to see the Ministry's continuing its tradition of recruiting the brightest and best, sir.
3 Thank you, Dawson.

1 Sign here please.	What is it?
2 It's a 27B/6, what did you think it was?

1 Listen .. um ... I don't want to get involved in any of this. But I work at the Ministry of Information, and I happen to know that Information Retrieval have been looking for an Archibald Tuttle, Heating Engineer. You wouldn't by any chance be -	My friends call me Harry. Information Retrieval, eh? Interesting!
2 What do they want you or?	Time to go.

1 Frank, take it easy. what happened?	He flipped out.

1 So, Frank, am I going to live?	You're going to live.
2 I've been thinking about things. Meditating on my financial future. You guys gave me plenty of time to meditate on the future. Whatja do, stop for Chinese on the way over? There's plenty of food in my place.	I was tired. I needed a coffee.
3 What about Kanita?	Dead.
4 That's too bad. Get some money, a nice looking girl on your arm, and everyone wants to take a piece. Some kid I wouldn't let wash my Mercedes is in my house, shooting at me. Damn, I thought I could make it onto the balcony like Tiger. He's fat, that's why, falls faster. I'm trying to watch my weight, and look what happens. Am I shot, Frank?	No.
5 Boy can't shoot for shit, either. Goddamn that's hot.

1 That's a hell of a swing you got there, Noel. I'm thinking Strawberry in his prime.	Strawberry ain't shit. Drug pussy.  Me.  I swing like Reggie. Mr. October. Number three, game six, World Series.

1 That boy you brought in, he was shot, wasn't he?	Yes.
2 He's dead, huh?	Yes.
3 I think this place stinks.	Our Lady of Misery.
4 Did you see my father?	No.
5 It's crazy in there. What's wrong with that doctor? He keeps mumbling, poking himself in the eye when he talks to me.	He's working a double shift.
6 Thing is, I'm supposed to be the fuckup. The one on the stretcher in there--that's supposed to be me. With my parents crying out here. I got a lot of guilt, you know what I mean?

1 I'm only asking because it's a dangerous building. There's been some robberies, a woman was raped not long ago. This woman I'm seeing, she'll want to talk to me all day, but if I can point to you out the window and say you're waiting, I can be out quick. if anything happens, I'll be in apartment 16M.	Maybe I should come up with you.
2 If I'm not back in fifteen minutes, hit the buzzer. That way she'll let me go.	Nothing's going to happen. I'll come with you.
3 No, I'll be fine. I'm just visiting a sick friend.

1 He's not dead. It's a heroin overdose. Break out the Narcon.	He's dead unless you folks want to stop bullshitting me and tell it straight. Then, Lord willing, we'll try to bring him back.

1 I hate vodka.	Please, a little decorum if you will. What I was going to say is, is that holding that baby in my arms, I felt like I was twenty-one again. A call like that makes me think of going back to three nights a week, not two, start running again, cut down on the drinking.
2 I'll drink to that.	Here's to the greatest job in the world.
3 Greatest job in the world.

1 Would you like to come in?	Yes.

1 Get this, Frank--we got two patients. Number one, the scarecrow outside. Number two misses the railing but breaks both legs on the balcony, then throws himself through a glass window, heads to the bedroom, where he's now passed out.	Well, he's the steakhead of the night, then.
2 I don't think the fire people can touch him out there.	How's he doing?
3 I haven't had a chance to see him yet. I'm going to take care of sleeping beauty.

1 Turn it off.	What?
2 You know what. The radio.

1 Jesus, Tom Walls, that crazy motherfucker.	Used to be my partner.

1 ...outlaw nation but strangely those who have interviewed Gaddafi find him, in a phrase we like to use in this country, very 'presidential'.	Nice, Jane.

1 I'm in a pissy mood.  I'm sorry.	What's wrong with it?
2 Nothing.  I think you really blew the lid off nookie.

1 Yes.  You're not going to stick around for the farewell party?	No.  I don't know how much fun it will be when Martin Klein and Ernie have to drop off their credentials with the security guard.

1 Where's where I asked him about being scared?  You should work on your speech.	No.  It makes me nervous to think about it.  Let's do this.

1 Me again.  Hi.  Listen Gaddafi doesn't foam at the mouth or anything.  When you speak to him he's not at all nuts. He seems like a leader -- very impressive, self-control...that's what's so strange.	Right and we have the '81 pilot on the way in -- Nobody else will have him.
2 You're welcome.  Sow how does it feel to...I know you gotta go -- Me too.  We're very busy here.

1 I told what's his name -- Tom -- that I'd meet him.	Call him -- I mean it can wait, right?
2 I don't know.  I may be in love with him.	No!!!!!

1 Let's go...	I just want to sit here longer, I mean the feeling is powerful -- why's that?
2 Maybe the best part of your life is over and you don't want to get up and start the bad part.

1 That's it.  I resign as of now.	Stop it.
2 I'll tell you what.  I'll stay if Tom knows how to spell Gaddafi.

1 All this business of war -- do you get scared?	Uh-uh.  I'm a little freaked right now about seeing my father though.

1 You don't have time.  Not a chance.	I'll be right down.  It's right tight.

1 Play back the last line...	He said something about...
2 Let me hear it!

1 Is everything all right?	Yes.  You didn't have to come here. It's just that I'm going to anchor this special report on this Libyan thing...
2 Anchor?	Yes, stop!  I wondered if you could find out anything about what's happening.  What's wrong?
3 I broke up with my roommate -- He was really the magnet for everyone who knew anything.	Oh.
4 Look, I can start up with him again if you really...	No.  I'm doing fine...Look.

1 I got my report card.  Three Cs, two Ds and an incomplete.	Oh my.  I see you studying so hard, Tom.  What do you think the problem is?
2 I'll just have to try harder.  I don't know.  I will.  I will.  I will.  I will.

1 Come on...Even I'm not that hard on myself.	No, I really got this job on a fluke and wait till you hear where it ends up.

1 Hi.	How's it going?
2 Can I buy you dinner sometime soon?	I just got back -- I don't know which end is up.
3 Okay.

1 Jane?	Yeah?
2 I'll wait for you till seven.	Okay.

1 Suppose I go in for a little while and you wait in the lobby-bar.  How's that?	Good.  That's it...See you.

1 Hi, again.  Sorry about...	No.  That sounds more important. Let's forget about tonight.
2 I don't know if that's absolutely necessary.	I've got my father coming through tomorrow anyway.  I should get some sleep.
3 Uh-huh.	I'll see you at the office.  Good night.

1 You're lucky I came after you so you got that off your...	Yes, I am.  Thanks.  I mean it.
2 It's okay.

1 I converted a bedroom -- this stuff builds up.  Wait till you've been doing this sixteen years.	I'm not knocking it.  It's a great solution.  Not only the storage but you can see everything you have.

1 Tonight.	What, right now?
2 Uh-huh.

1 What the hell's going on?	Everyone wants to meet the bus boy.
2 What did he do?	He made a cat.

1 Gee..twenty five dollars for something I made!	Now you're a professional!

1 It's true, isn't it?	Every word...

1 But you gotta love me!  Why do you think I made that statue of Alice?!	Walter, I'm sorry...
2 You just can't be sorry! I wanna - I wanna marry you!

1 Ah, your new head shot...  I like it, very much...	Do you have to be so cold to him?

1 Well then admit it, it's a work of genius.	I admit it.

1 Man that's a trippy name, kinda like the Warhol mayhem series...	I saw a statue once called The Third Time Phyllis Saw Me She Exploded.
2 Now what kind of statue was that?	I don't know it was made out of driftwood and dipped in sulfuric acid.  It was out there...

1 Where'd ya buy that?	I didn't buy it I made it.

1 Go home.	OK...good night Mr. De Santis!
2 Good night Walter.

1 You better hold off on the bubbly.	Yeah, why?
2 You might talk too much.	Yeah and what would I say?

1 Hello, Walter.	Hi.  I know you!  I've seen you down at the Jabberjaw plenty.
2 Yes, you have.  Can I come in?	Uh, sure.

1 YOU'RE GONNA SHOOT ME!	Walter shut up and relax!
2 NO YOU'RE GONNA SHOOT ME DON'T SHOOT -

1 After that we go no more!	Hiya Maxwell.

1 Oh, hello Mrs. Swicker.	Hello Walter.  I want to tell you the super fixed the leaky pipes and sealed up that hole in your wall.
2 Oh, OK.	Walter you look awful pale! What did you have to eat today?
3 I had a salami sandwich, Mrs. Swicker.	If you were my son...why don't you let me fix you a nice hot bowl of soup, it won't take but a minute.
4 Oh no, that's OK, I can fix myself something.  Besides, I got something important to do...

1 What's wrong with you!?!	My arm!  He took my fucking arm!
2 Shut up!  You let him have it!

1 Don't grab me, okay?	Absolutely.  I see now the error of my mistake.

1 Rich bitches.  They're a plague. They've gotta be stopped.	You didn't like them.
2 They're all the same!  They're so stuck up, they're just... they're not even human.  I hate them.	Would you sleep with them?
3 Yes.  Definitely.  Definitely. Please, God.	Well, there it is, isn't it?  You don't even like them, and you'd sleep with them.  What's that all about?
4 I got a news flash, man, another shot of this and I'll have sex with you.	Oh, yeah, and then you'll never call me.

1 Are there any good sicknesses that aren't too depressing?	Guys.  The environment.  I'm telling you, it's totally key.  The earth is in terrible shape, we could al die, and besides, Sting's doing it.

1 Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.	You were having a nightmare.

1 Ah, my fool is dead.  He was careless, always.  Still, I'll pull out your tongue for that.  Don't you understand?  I've killed you a dozen times.  Your life is not a blink of my eye, not a single breath.  I have lived in the shadows, in the pulsing filth behind men's eyes.  A thousand years, and more. I have conversed with the worms that fed on my corpse and I have bathed in the blood of emperors.	Have you ever thrown up in the front row of a Richard Marx concert?
2 What?

1 You had a car full of stuff.  Were you leaving?	Yeah, I was bailing.  I have a friend, and he's really... well, he's really vampire, I guess.  Bad scene.
2 Well, stay here tonight.	Thanks.  Tomorrow morning, I'm on a bus.  I'm gone.
3 Where are you gonna go?	Well, I've always wanted to see Oxnard.

1 Leave me alone.	Benny was right.  You guys are all exactly the same.

1 Can't.  History report.  The Normans and the Saxons.	Bogutude.  Blow it off.
2 I really can't.  Besides, it's pretty interesting.	You're weird and I'm afraid of you. Seriously, Cassandra, there's a lot cooler things you could be doing than your homework.
3 Like what?	Like my homework.

1 You were supposed to be here at three.	I forgot.
2 Buffy, what is your sitch?  You're acting like The Thing From Another Tax-Bracket; it's too weird.	Look, a lot's been going on.  That's what I wanted to tell you guys about. I need to tell you.  You see... a while ago, I met this guy --
3 Oh my God you're having an affair.

1 I had a dream once where I was... There was like, knights in it, and I worked in this bar.  And I... was fighting.  I'm always fighting. And there's a guy...  He's not always there, but he's horrible, all white, and he's always... trying to kill me.	Lothos.

1 What, um...  What do we do?	There's a great deal I have to show you, I'm not even sure where to start  There's so little time.
2 Why do you keep saying that?	Do you know what a Vampire-King is?
3 A Vampire-King?  You mean like Dracula?	Oh, yes.  And the man from your dreams.  Lothos.
4 Oh, him.	Yes.  They travel about, usually with one or two of their followers to lay the groundwork.  The vampires find a community and they feed on it, make it their own.  You were difficult to trace, and I think the process has gone a lot further than I'd anticipated.  Usually this goads a community into some kind of paranoid frenzy.  But for some reason, nobody here seems to be paying any attention.
5 What?	We'll cover it later.
6 I still don't get how they happened to come to my town.  I mean, was I born here because... because they were coming here?  That Lothos guy, and his buddies?	In a way, yes.  Your fate is inexorably connected to them.
7 Great.  First I have a birthright, now I've got a fate.  Hey, do I have to take notes on this?	We're going to have the work hard. You'll need some excuse for staying out.  For your parents.

1 He was slow.  Very simple.  They won't all be that easy.	Fine.
2 And the alley was a mistake.  Never corner yourself like that.  If they'd come at you in force you'd be dead now.  One vampire is a lot easier to kill then ten.	Does the world 'Duhh' mean anything to you?
3 You felt a little sick, didn't you? The cramps.

1 Wait!	He knows who I am!

1 Don't worry, Jennifer.  Someday your prince will come.	Yeah, just make sure you do first. Let's go, guys.
2 B'bye.

1 I can't!	You know you must.  There is only one.  Now you are that one.  It is time.
2 Why?  Why me?	She has died.  You are the next to be called.  Why do you think you were sent to me?  Trained as you were?  You bear the mark.

1 I can't believe they still ate it.	Where'd you learn how to do that?

1 The don't.  You kind of wish they would, though.	Wit-tay.
2 I'm sorry.  I'm Pike.  This is Benny.	Pike isn't a name.  It's a fish.
3 Hey, wait a minute...

1 I really was way way too too.	Oh, please!  When she ran onto the field in the middle of the game? Was that the most out-of-it thing ever, or did I blink?
2 I'm, like, yelling at her, 'What are you doing?'  And she's going 'Jeffrey, Jeffrey!'  Way mental.

1 Mmm, hmmm.  You shoulda seen how many people came to the airport to see me off.  When I got drafted first it was the happiest day of my Father's life.  He likes baseball more than I do...	You can learn to like it.
2 I wanted to be the host of Dance Fever, somethin' like that...	Y'know if you make it to the Bigs you could still become the host of Dance Fever.  Baseball's a good stepping stone for things like that.
3 God, I never thought of that.	There is a lot of things you never thought of, sweetie--now get some rest for tonight's game.

1 God...I think I'm gonna be sick--	Oh don't be silly.  Death is nothing to be scared of.  It's just another way of living.  It's just a fresh start--kinda like spring training.

1 We lost.	it's okay..

1 Omigawd, honey, I'm so happy for you.	He's a virgin.

1 I'm committed to Nuke for the season.  You had your chance the other night.	What'you see in that guy--he's dim, pretty boy.  a young, wild,
2 Young men are uncomplicated.  And he's not "dim".  He's just inexperienced.  My job is to give him "life-wisdom" and help him make it to the major leagues.	That's my job too.

1 Why baseball?	I was raised in a Baptist church got dipped in the water when I was 5-- born again before kindergarten...by the time I was 10 I knew it was bullshit and at 15 I ran away from home...

1 Take this to Ebby in the dugout between innings.	What's it say?
2 It says he's not bending his back on his follow-through.

1 Ebby Calvin LaLoosh.	You need a nickname.
2 That's what I been telling everybody!  Wanta dance?

1 I got him on the knee!	You missed him!
2 God damn It, Jack, he still ain't touched the plate.

1 You got a Hall of Fame arm but you're pissing it away.	I ain't pissing nothing away--I got a Porsche already.  A 944 with A.C. and a quadraphonic Blaupunkt.
2 You don't need a quadraphonic Blaupunkt--you need a curve ball.  In the Show, everybody can hit the fastball.	You been in the Majors?
3 Yep.

1 You told him I was throwing a deuce, right?	Yep.  He really crushed that dinger, didn't he.  Musta gone 450 feet...damn...

1 Settle what?	C ' mon!
2 I don't wanta fight you, I wanta thank you.  Let's have a drink and forget this--	God damn it, you fucking virgin prick--step outside.

1 I'm too old for this shit.  Why the hell am I back in "A" ball?	'Cause of Ebby Calvin LaLoosh.  The Big Club's got a hundred grand in him-

1 Hi, Jimmy.  Want a ride?	Have you accepted Jesus Christ as your personal savior?
2 No.	Can I give you my testimony?
3 You can do anything you want.  Hop in.

1 Patkin was a tribute to baseball...	...and one helluva guy.

1 Look at yours.	What?
2 Look at that. Look at this. There's nothin'... look how many blueberries your muffin has and how many mine has. Yours is falling apart. I have nothing.	What are you talking about?
3 It's like everything else in this place. You don't do it yourself, it never gets done.

1 He even played golf with the President.	On behalf of the Teamsters' Pension Fund, it is my pleasure to present to you . . .
2 But Andy also took orders. And when he was told to give a pension fund loan to Philip Green...	...this check for $62,700,000 for the new Tangiers.

1 Stop -	Wait, hold on a second.
2 Hey!	Hold on a second.

1 Sam, let me ask you a question. You must really trust your wife.	Yeah, sure I do. Why?
2 No, tha-that's good. It's just unusual. To tell you the truth, so many of my clients don't.	Well...

1 You know, havin' some fun with it, shit like that.	Where the hell did you learn how to deal? 
2 He bet like a fuckin' brain surgeon.	Place the checks properly. That's the way you do it.

1 After we ate, we left Jennifer and Ginger alone and we took a ride to talk. And then... he hit me with it.	What do you think about me movin' out here?  What's the matter? You got a problem with that?
2 No, of course not.	You mean, I have your permission?
3 Sure, you have my permission. But I - I just gotta tell you it's no joke out here. It's no joke, you know? You gotta keep a low profile. It's not like back home. Right off the bat, they don't like guys like us. And this sheriff's a real cowboy. Even the coppers aren't afraid to bury people out in the desert here.	I don't care. I want to get away from back home for a while. I'm tired of that shit back there.  Look at this place. It's made of money. You know what the best part is? Nobody's gonna know what we're doin'! There's nobody here to see us! Everybody's back home.
4 Nick, I gotta tell you, I got pinched twice for no reason. You really gotta be careful. I'm running a licensed place. Everything's legit.	Don't worry about it. I'm not gonna do anything. What am I gonna do? I'm especially not gonna involve you in anything.

1 He insulted Billy. And then I walked over to him politely...	...and he tells me to go fuck myself.
2 What?	Then he called me a faggot.
3 So what do you think I do? I threw that cocksucker out.	What? Ho-  Hey, come here.

1 Hello.	Listen...

1 Where the fuck you get off talkin' to people about me behind my back? Goin' over my head?	What people?
2 What people! What'd you think, I wasn't gonna find out?	I don't even know what you're talkin' about, Nick.
3 No? You said I'm bringin' heat on you?! I gotta listen to people because of your fuckin' shit?! You're ordering me out?! You better get your own fuckin' army, pal!	I didn't do anything. I mean, I didn't order you or anybody...  I only told Andy Stone that you had a lot of heat on you, and that was a problem.
4 You want me to get out of my own fuckin' town?!	Yeah, I said I - let the bullshit blow over for a while so I can run the casino. Anything goes wrong with the casino, it's my ass. It's not yours, it's my ass.
5 Oh, I don't know whether you know this or not, but you only have your fuckin' casino because I made that possible!	I -
6 I'm what counts out here! Not your fuckin' country clubs or your fuckin' TV shows! And what the fuck are you doin' on TV anyhow?!	What are you -
7 You know I get calls from back home every fuckin' day?!  They think you went batshit!	I'm only on TV because I gotta be able to hang around the casino. You understand that. You know that. Come on.
8 Your fuckin' ass! You could have had the food and beverage job without goin' on television!  You wanted to go on TV.	Yeah, I did want to go on TV. That way I have a forum. I can fight back. I'm known. People see me. They know they can't fuck around with me like they could if I was an unknown. That's right.
9 You're makin' a big fuckin' spectacle of yourself.	Me?! I wouldn't even be in this situation if it wasn't for you. You brought down so much fuckin' heat on me. I mean, every time I meet somebody here, the big question is do I know you.
10 Oh, sure. Now you want to blame your fuckin' license on me, is that it?	No, it - it - Nicky, when you asked me if you could come out here, what did I tell you? I mean, you asked me, and I knew you were going to come out no matter what I said, but what did I tell you? Do you remember what I told...
11 Back -	...you? Do you remember what I told you?
12 Back - Back up, back up a fuckin' minute here. One minute. I asked you?! When the fuck did I ever ask you if I could come out here?! Get this through your head, you -	You never - ?
13 Get this through your head, you Jew motherfucker, you. You only exist out here because of me!  That's the only reason!  Without me, you, personally, every fuckin' wiseguy skell [Skell: the lowest form of wiseguy - a drunken bum] around'll take a piece of your fuckin' Jew ass! Then where you gonna go?!  You're fuckin' warned! Don't ever go over my fuckin' head again! You motherfucker, you!

1 Hey, house is doin' well.  Hey, all that money is rollin' in. I appreciate you takin' the time to see a poor ol' civil servant.	No, that's quite all right.

1 Hello.	Hello, Jennifer, it's Sam -

1 To Abraham Lincoln.	L'chaim. [Yiddish for 'to life']
2 Here we go. Good luck.

1 ...she took care of the valet parkers, the guys who could get you anything and take care of anything.	Thanks a lot.

1 Hi. Nice to see you.	She could be the most charming woman you ever saw. People loved to be around her.

1 You see, if a phone's tapped, the Feds can only listen in...	...on the stuff involving crimes. So on...
2 ...routine calls, they have to click off after a few minutes.	Yeah, and I get a sprained fuckin' elbow.

1 I want you out of here! I want you out of here!	Let go of me! Let go of me!

1 All right... I didn't have lunch with Jennifer.	Who were you with?
2 I was with somebody.	I know you were with somebody. Who was it?  I just hope it's not someone who I think it might be.  I just hope it's not them.

1 I'm afraid to let her in the house.	Oh, you are...
2 I'm afraid she's gonna destroy stuff.	Let me in the house! Fucker!

1 Loose machines are right back over there.	What are they doin' way back there? Bring 'em up here where they belong. You can't even see 'em over there.
2 Okay, I'll -	What about the progressives with the high jackpots? Where are they? These machines are hidden.
3 Well...	These are our best machines. They bring all the action. No wonder the drop is off.
4 Yeah, okay.	The action is in the front, not in the back. Bring 'em up front.
5 All right, I will, I will.	Listen to me very carefully. There are three ways of doing things around here. The right way, the wrong way, and the way I do it. You understand?
6 I do understand that. I'll get right on it. And thank you.	Don't thank me, just do it. You're the Slots Manager. I shouldn't have to tell you this.
7 Dang, you are right, Mr Rothstein, I am so sorry.

1 I just wanna get out of here.	And don't forget to tell your friends what happens if they fuck around in here. You understand?
2 I'm sorry. I made a bad mistake.	You're fuckin' right, you made a bad mistake. 'Cause if you come back here - we catch either one of you - we're gonna break your fuckin' heads and you won't walk out of here. You see that fuckin' saw?  We're gonna use it. You don't fuck around in this place. You got it?
3 Yeah.	Get out of here.
4 Thank you.

1 No, I don't want one.  Hey, Mr Clark, how you doin'?	Hi. Good.
2 I've been trying to reach you. You're tougher to get than the President.	Well, I've been busy. 
3 Yeah, least you could do is return my phone calls, though.	Listen... Nicky... we talked about this... and, uh, I explained to you that there was the possibility you might have to take some kind of loss.
4 Yeah.  I think I want my money back.	What're you gonna do? Strong-arm me?
5 You know... I think that you've gotten the wrong impression about me. I think in all fairness, I should explain to you what it is that I do. For instance, tomorrow morning I'll get up nice and early, take a walk down over to the bank and walk in and see you, and, uh... if you don't have my money for me, I'll crack your fuckin' head wide open in front of everybody in the the bank. And just about the time that I'm comin' out of jail, hopefully, you'll be comin' out of your coma. And guess what?  I'll split your fuckin' head open again. Because I'm fuckin' stupid. I don't give a fuck about jail.  That's my business. That's what I do. And we know what you do, don't we, Charlie? You fuck people out of money and get away with it.	You can't talk to me like...
6 Hey, you fat Irish prick. You put my fuckin' money to sleep. You go get my money, or I'll put your fuckin' brain to sleep.	Sam?
7 Never mind fuckin' Sam. This is personal.  I'll be there in the morning. You can fuckin' try me, fatso.

1 Hey!	Hey!

1 Beautiful. You got a beautiful swing.	Ace got my son, little Nicky, involved with Little League, and it was great.
2 Now, I want you to get out there and get me singles and doubles, okay? 'Cause that's what's gonna win this game.	Turned out to be one of the other coaches was a fuckin'...
3 Now go out there and show your dad what you can do.	...metro intelligence cop. But it didn't matter. I mean, it was all about the kids, you know.
4 You know, he's gotta realize everything can't be a home run that he does.	Yeah, well, that's exactly what I keep tellin' him, but that's the kind of kid he is ever since he's born.
5 It's instinctive, you know.	He tries to do everything...

1 Carmine? He was here before. I saw him. He had a suitcase and everything, and then he left.	Carmine left?
2 Uh-huh.

1 I mean, unless Ace made his bet.	That's enough now!

1 And take it easy with this shit, will you? I mean, this can only make matters worse.	Oh, come on.
2 You're a beautiful girl. You don't want to ruin your looks. I've seen a lot of girls get shot to hell from this stuff.	You're so nice. 
3 Come on, now, I don't want to see you unhappy.

1 I do. I need a new sponsor.	Is that what you want?
2 Yeah.	A sponsor.
3 Yeah.	Mm... okay. Don't worry about it. Nobody'll fuck with ya anymore. I'll take care of ya.
4 Nicky, please...	Yes, I will. It's what you want, isn't it? Huh?
5 Thank you. Yeah, yeah, yeah.	It's what you want?
6 Yeah. Uh-huh -

1 Thank you, sir, I appreciate that. Everybody, thanks. Gives some chips as tips to the dealer and box man. Thanks. Take care, Steve. Take chances and drive fast.	Ginger, honey.

1 What does that mean? No, I know that look. What does that mean?	It means I got the money.
2 You got money. That's a - That's a good look.

1 Wow.	Boy, look at this place, huh?
2 Incredible.	All right.

1 I actually turned my bedroom into a bank vault where I kept the choice stuff.	She asleep?
2 Every night, on the couch.

1 Mm.	Fuckin' Jews stick together, don't they?
2 They're havin' a good time too.	So are we.

1 Frankie!	No more! You see? Watch!

1 I've never trusted him. And you know I got eyes...	...behind my head. They trust that scumbag, I don't. Right now, the way I feel, I'll hit the two of them in the head with a fuckin' shovel.
2 All right, take it easy now, take it easy.	Mom, I'm sorry, they're beatin' me left and right.  Ma, I'm sorry. I'm all upset.
3 I know, but that's enough.	You know - You know - You know what they're doin' to me?
4 I know it, I know it.	I can't take this no more. Back and forth, back and forth.
5 Take it easy, though.	All right, all right. But I - I -
6 You'll get a heart attack like that.	You know, I - I'm too upset right now. And - An end has to be put to this.

1 Have we reached the epi-center?	Ayy!  Some cat's blocking the periscope.  Somebody, give it a swat...

1 What's the matter...	Nothing, just a jolt of deja-vu. I think I went out with a guy with a dignified British butler--can't remember how it turned out..
2 I'll bet the butler's name wasn't "Jeff."	You're probably right.
3 I was wondering, if you're not doing anything tonight...Would you like to go to dinner? I know; a tame suggestion considering the wide variety of miniature golf possibilities available to the Oasisburg citizen--but nevertheless, would you?

1 No-o. You know, questions like that don't help your cause--	I still can't get over it. I still can't believe you're Catwoman..

1 You're kidding.	But it's true!  You can call him yourself.

1 Will you please stop fighting?  Just let those people die so we can get on with our new lives together!  Trust me, one day we'll look back on this day and laugh. You got to admit, it's a lot more fun to be the villain.	You might be right, but Fun is overrated.  I need something real.
2 Well then, let's agree to disagree...Now how about a picture for my scrapbook?

1 Right time. That was kind of fun. She had spunk.	Why am I still troubled...

1 You like them, don't you, Boss.	Oh, I like her. I like her a lot. I want to save this one for later. Something that tasty you don't eat all at once. Go back to your alter- egos, we'll regroup in the morning.

1 Spooky.	Spear.

1 There you are, Selina. I've been thinking..I have some.."positions" opening up..	Stop.
2 Oh, what?  I offer you a job in implied exchange for physical favors and suddenly it's "sexual harassment..."	Can I be frank, Frank?  Your entire existence is sexual harassment. I accept there's not much you can do about it.

1 I'm afraid last night was the last straw of our city's tourists. The Mayor, in his finite wisdom, is throwing a "Month of the Woman" luncheon ball for the public this afternoon to try and calm everyone down. I thought maybe you and I could...	Go together?  Sure, why not?  Another date with someone who could be an insane messenger of death for all I know. No offense. Hey, lean over, let me smell your breath..Say in a deep voice, "A superhero's job is to protect..."
2 You're scaring me, Selina.  Do it some more.

1 I'll take your abuse, but it's way too early for the sanctimonious Cult of Gag...	Oh, so now even the keepers of the city don't meet your standards...You're late.

1 Hey Buddy!  Can you let me pull over?  Give me some space to pull over.	Where do you think you're going?
2 Any place.	This is one way.
3 I know.  But it's an emergency. Somebody dying.  Okay?	I don't see anybody in there but you.
4 I would appreciate a little space. Thank you.

1 I know where it is.  Give me that phone back.	I'm not finished.  Under other circumstances I'd gladly go out of my way.  I don't understand why you just don't phone some other person.
2 She can't!  It's busted.  Now hand that on back!	Theo wants to talk again.
3 Did you have to tell her my name?

1 Nels reporting in.  Sit down where you are.  Arms folded.	Yes sir.

1 Now turn around.  I'm going to cuff you.	Put those away.  We can't have marks on his wrists.
2 You never miss a trick.	I'll see that he stays calm.  Pack the money up and put it in the trunk.

1 Nels, don't let that cop pass you.	What am I supposed to do?

1 Fine, no tunnel.  Are you still with me?  Hello?	I hear them coming upstairs.  I won't be able to talk for awhile. I have to lay the phone down and pretend to be asleep.  So don't talk.  Don't say a word or they'll hear it.
2 I can't stay on this line.  I'm picking people up.  I'm already overdue.  Hello? 

1 What do you do for a living?	Sometimes I paint.
2 Our house always needs touching up.	Pictures.
3 I didn't mean to insult you. You're an artist.	They say my work is somewhat derivative.

1 Wait just a minute.  Our luck has changed.	What do you mean?
2 Black Mercedes, 600S.

1 Rachel was terrified when I left her.  I could see it in her eyes.	She'll be with you soon.  They're pulling up.  They'll realize I kept my part of the bargain.
2 She'll never be the same.  None of us will.	Include me in that.

1 I'm still okay.	Inform him the fee is seventy-five large for your return.  All parts intact.
2 He wants 75 back.	Plus names, addresses and I.D. for the lot of you.  We're in this together and I need to know who my partners are.  In case I ever need to roll over on somebody.
3 Did you hear that?	Let me talk to him.  Hold the phone to my ear -- but don't nudge me.

1 I'm going to cuff you and leave you in that house.  It may take awhile but you'll be found after we're long gone.	That's not good enough.
2 That's how it's going to be.

1 Thank God -- thank God I've got you.	Who is this?
2 You mustn't hang up.

1 I'm opening the side door.  She'll step out.  But before she gets in your vehicle I want to see the first installment put down in plain view.  If it isn't there I'm shooting her in the back.	Are you trying to panic the women?
2 That's how it is.  You see her approaching you toss out installment one.	I'm tying it up in a bundle now. Where is she?

1 Yeah?	I just strolled out of the emergency room while they were admitting Rodriego.
2 You couldn't be calling at a worse time, Nels.

1 Since when did you guys start changing tires?	Only you <u>don't</u> have a flat.
2 Seems not.	If you weren't going for a spare what were you doing?
3 Something was rattling around. Some loose tools.	Mind if I have a look?

1 So can we consider you a regular, sir?	Is that good or bad?
2 Well, you get to say, The usual, Col. Things like that.

1 That's what he said. Jimmy.	Hi, Jimmy.

1 Cunt. Scrag-eyed dyke cunt.	Charming.

1 Do it on your own time, Paddy.	What?
2 Whatever it is she does for you.

1 That should make her happy.	Who's she?
2 Don't know. Who is she?

1 Now, if you asked me to meet you tomorrow, it would really drive him insane.	Where?
2 Half-five. At Millie's.

1 Sorry. How'd he drive with his neck in a brace?	Must be in love to manage that.
2 Doesn't know the meaning of the word.

1 So what do you want with me, Jimmy?	Want to look after you.
2 What does that mean?	Something I heard someone say once.

1 Never let the sun go down on an argument, Jody used to say.	What you doing here?
2 Got your note. So let's kiss and make up, hon.	Don't call me that.
3 Sorry, darling.	Give it over, Dil --
4 Apologies, my sweet.

1 There's Dave. He knew too.	Stop it, Jimmy.

1 She own you, Jimmy?	Yes.
2 She from Scotland too?	You could say that.
3 And you're not going to tell me more?	I can't.

1 Why?	For me.
2 For you...

1 Are you all right, Dil?	I will be.

1 See, I should blow you away, Jimmy. But I can't do that. Yet.	Let me go, Dil

1 She was --	And she used her tits and that cute little ass to get him, didn't she?
2 Yes.	Tell me what she wore.
3 Can't remember...

1 You'll notice I've asked you nothing.	That's wise, Tommy.
2 All right, then. I like to be wise.

1 Leave her out of this.	Jesus, Fergus, you're a walking cliche. You know we won't leave her out of this. But I'm glad to see you care.

1 Made the front page. They'll move now, the fuckers.	Request permission to take the hood off, Tommy.
2 Why would you do that?	The poor whore's suffocating in the heat.
3 So?	And anyway, he's seen our faces.
4 You sure?	He described me down to a T. Knows what Jude looks like.

1 And what's she like between the sheets?	Definitely unusual.
2 And who is she?	Just a girl.
3 And you know what'll happen if you fuck up again, don't you?	Aye, I do, Peter.
4 Good.

1 Now, if you took the ropes off, I'd be able to feed myself.	No fucking way.
2 Only joking.

1 So when you come to shoot me, Paddy, remember, you're getting rid of a shit- hot bowler.	I'll bear that in mind.

1 Where would you most like to be now, man?	Doesn't matter where.
2 Come on, man. If this shit was all over.	Having a pint in the Rock.
3 You lack imagination, Fergus. Think of something more alluring.	Like what?
4 Like having a pint in the Metro --

1 Not a lot of use, are you, Fergus?	Me? No, I'm not good for much...

1 I never know nothing.	People. They could be looking.

1 Now Dyle, you listen to me -- my mama didn't raise no stupid children. I know who's got the money 'n I ain't disappearing till I got my share -- 'n' my share's growin' a whole lot bigger ev'ry day.	Where are you, ol' buddy?
2  I'll tell you what, fella -- you want t' find me, you jus' turn 'round -- from now on I'll be right behind you. 

1 I know why you're not taken -- no one can catch up with you.	Relax -- you're gaining.

1 as outlined in report number three- nine-stroke-five-two of the Western Hemisphere Conference held on March 22 --  no wait! It was last Thursday, five o'clock at the Jardin des Champs- lyses! Adam -- that was it! The garden!	It's Thursday today -- and it's almost five -- come on!

1 I'm sorry I thought you were the murderer, Adam -- how did I know that he was as big a liar as you are?	And that's all the gratitude I get for saving your hide.
2 The truth, now -- was it my hide -- or the stamps?	What a terrible thing to say. How could you even think that?
3 All right, prove it to me -- tell me to go to the Embassy first thing in the morning and turn in those stamps.

1 Why not?	Because they're still here.
2 Oh.	Like I said, Mrs Lampert -- I'm afraid you're in a great deal of danger. Remember what happened to Charles.

1 Are you sure there's no mistake?	None whatsoever. Please, Mrs. Lampert -- be careful.

1 Sorry about that.	Okay -- up there.

1 Good morning, Mr. Dyle.	Reggie?
2 It's the only name I've got. How about you?	No cat and mouse -- you've got me. What do you want to know?
3 Why you lied to me.	I had to -- for all I knew you could have been in on the whole thing.
4 Well, you know now, so please tell me who you are.	But you know my name -- it's Dyle.
5 Carson Dyle is dead.	Yes, he is. He was my brother.
6 Your --	The army thinks he was killed in action by the Germans, but I think they did it -- Tex, Gideon and Scobie -- and your husband -- because he wouldn't go along with their scheme to steal the gold. I think he threatened to turn them in and they killed him. I'm trying to prove it. They think I'm working with them. But I'm not, and that's the truth. I'm on your side, Reggie -- please believe that.
7 How can I? You lied to me -- the way Charles did -- and after promising you wouldn't. Oh, I want to believe you, Peter... oh, but I can't call you that anymore, can I? It will take me a while to get used to your new name -- which I don't even know yet. What is it?  Aren't you going to tell me?  Hello -- ?

1 They've got Jean-Louis!	That sounds like their problem.
2 I'll be right there.

1 Hurry up and change -- I'm starved.	Let me know what you want -- I'll pick a suit that matches.

1 Monsieur Flix -- ?	I was expecting you. You are American too, of course.
2 Yes.	The man who bought them last week was American. I did not see him but I heard. I knew you would come.

1 Mrs. Lampert --	What do you want?
2 Didn't Charles tell you, Mrs. Lampert?	Tell me what?
3 It doesn't belong to you, Mrs. Lampert -- you do know that, don't you?	I don't know anything.
4 Mrs. Lampert, any morning now you could wake up dead.	Leave me alone -- !
5 Dead, Mrs. Lampert -- like last week's news -- like Charles, Mrs. Lampert --	Stop it!

1 Of course it is.	And this?

1 But he is gone.	I don't blame him. Jean-Louis -- do you know where this Monsieur Flix lives?
2 No -- but I will ask.

1 What was all that?	Fun and games. Evidently we're the floorshow.
2 You mean you and me?	No, everyone. Come on -- avanti, avanti!

1 Go on.	That's all.
2 No, it isn't -- where's the money?	I don't know.  Those men killed Charles to get it. But he must not have had it with him on the train.
3 So they think he left it with you.	But he didn't! I've looked everywhere --  And if I don't find it --  Those men going to kill me.

1 It belongs to me, Miz Lampert -- an' if you don't give it to me your life ain't gonna be worth the paper it's printed on. You savvy what I'm sayin', Miz Lampert?	Please stop -- please!
2 You think on it real careful-like, Miz Lampert -- y'hear?

1 Who is it from?	The American Embassy.

1 Yeah. Chris BERRINGER WAS PARKED OUTSIDE THE WINDOW.	I wonder why it's so important to know if they fucked?

1 If I'd gone public with this yesterday Annette Michaels might be alive today.	Oh GOD Brent, is there anything you don't feel guilty about?
2 is there anything you do?	Focus on the present. You always want to change the past. Let's figure out what you are going to tell the parents today, not what you should told them yesterday.
3 I'm going to tell them everything I know. I'm calling a town meeting for eight p.m.	You tell these people someone is out there killing virgins and we're going to have a goddamn fuckfest on our hands.
4 Better than a pile of dead teenagers.

1 You know her?	It can't be.
2 Who is she Daddy?	Never mind darling. You go back to school. I don't want you missing anymore classes today.

1 Hello?	I'm looking for Lisa Sherman.
2 She's not here.	You know where I can find her?
3 St. Michael's.	She works at a church?
4 She resides there. Out back. She died a year and a half ago.

1 Please get out of my way or I'll have to hurt you.	I knew you were a pervert. Always wearing those fucking doofy glasses, and driving a station wagon.

1 The seat behind him is open. Come on, I can eavesdrop too.	You eventually have to talk to him.
2 Why? All my mom and dad ever do is watch each other eat and they've been married for twenty years.

1 You ok?	FINE. Are you?
2 Hurricane Hormone. it's flattened the whole school. Guess what?	What?
3 Mark invited me to the party.	What party?
4 Shh. Ben's party. Tonight. Haven't you heard?	No.

1 All our parents are weirdoes. I think my dad is into hookers. I know he lit cats on fire when he was a kid.	My dad acts like he's Johnny Fucking Perfect and he's really Johnny Fucking Rapist.
2 I think this is a big part of growing up. It's losing your spiritual virginity. It's when you finally discover that your parents aren't anything they told you they were. They're even bigger hypocrites than your friends.	I can't believe I listened to one word of his shit.
3 But if he'd been sent to jail, there would be no Jody.	So I should feel happy that he got away with it?
4 I don't know. I kind of am.

1 What are you doing?	Pretend we're just another couple.

1 Yes?	Are you Jody?

1 There's Jan and Heather. Let's grab them quick before someone else does.	Ok.
2 Hide your laptop here.	No.
3 You can't bring it.	I'm not leaving it here.

1 What'd he say?	Don't be tedious, waiter.  Dr. Long called it Elvis.

1 So you called the damned thing Elvis	I had no idea how powerful it was.
2  Eighteen men were k- killed in sec-...	 ...-onds...with just a fraction of what's in...

1 Whoo-hoo! 	Are you crazy?!  Take the boat?!

1 Do you know what'll...	...happen if I drop this?
2 Brynner.	Well, Lieutenant Vitelli.
3 Good to see you again, Leo.	Pleasant surprise.
4 I can't say it's a surprise.	And I certainly can't say it's pleasant.
5 As soon as I heard Elvis was on the loose, you came to mind.	I checked your release date.  I never liked coincidences.
6 And I don't like deviations from plans, Leo, as I'm sure you re-...

1 Sir?	I said horseshit.  Horseshit.
2 Yes, sir, that's what it looks like. I'll give you that.

1 I've got the photographs in my office. If they'll help you remember. What was the argument about?	My daughter.
2 What about her?	Just find the girl, Mr. Gittes. I think she is frightened and I happen to know Hollis was fond of her. I'd like to help her if I can.
3 I didn't realize you and Hollis were so fond of each other.

1 They don't kill a guy for that.	Oh they don't?
2 Not for your wife. That's the unwritten law.

1 Then what'll you do?	Sue the shit out of 'em.

1 I don't want it anymore.	No?
2 No. It was an accident.	You mean that's what you're going to call it.

1 It's too late.	Too late for what?
2 They only dump the water at night.

1 No.	Do you know where she might be?
2 Certainly not!

1 No. I went riding rather early.	Looks like you went quite a distance.
2 No, Just riding bareback, that's all. Anyway, you might try the Oak Pass or Stone Canyon Reservoirs. Sometimes at lunch Hollis takes walks around them. Otherwise he'll be home by 6:30.	I'll stop by.
3 Please call first.

1 I don't like the word 'cheat.'	Did you have affairs?
2 Mr. Gittes.	Did he know?
3 Well I wouldn't run home and tell him whenever I went to bed with someone, if that's what you mean.

1 You've got one going, Mrs. Mulwray.	Oh.

1 As little as possible.	The District Attorney gives his men advice like that?
2 They do in Chinatown.

1 I can't...	Because of Hollis? Because she was seeing your husband? Was that it? Jesus Christ, say something. Was that it?

1 ...he had a breakdown... the dam broke... my mother died... he became a little boy... I was fifteen... he'd ask me what to eat for breakfast, what clothes to wear!... It happened... then I ran away...	To Mexico...

1 Hello, Miss Sessions. I don't believe we've had the pleasure.	Oh yes we have... are you alone, Mr. Gittes?
2 Isn't everybody? What can I do for you, Miss Sessions?

1 Can I help you?  Russ Yelburton, Deputy Chief in the Department.	J.J. Gittes. And it's not a departmental matter.
2 I wonder if you'd care to wait in my office?

1 The water.	What about the water?
2 When it comes.	When it comes? What'd you tell him?
3 Comes in different parts of the river. Every night a different part.

1 Can't we talk about this alone, Mr. Gittes?	I'm afraid not, Mrs. Mulwray. These men are my operatives and at some point they're going to assist me. I can't do everything myself.
2 Of course not.	Now, what makes you certain he is involved with someone?

1 Jesus Christ, Walsh. That's what you spent your day doing?	Look, you tell me to take pictures, I take pictures.
2 Let me explain something to you, Walsh. This business requires a certain finesse.

1 Course, she settled down nicely.	Well, you never know, do you?
2 That's for sure.	Why'd she run away?
3 Oh, you know. She was sixteen or seventeen.	We missed the best of it, didn't we, pal?

1 You understand which side the gelatin's on?	It tastes wonderful!

1 Eh! Love...what a mystery!  I understand you, Toto...The ones with blue eyes are the most beautiful. Whatever you do, you can't make friends with them.  Eh, there's nothing to be done about it! The heavier a man is, the deeper his footprints. And if he's in love, he suffers, because he knows he's up a one-way street. Because love is a meaningless thing when a man gets it into his head to do what he wants... 	What you say is wonderful! But sad...
2 They're not my words. John Wayne said it in Shepherd of the Hills.

1 Good morning, father. It's hard on the feet, huh?	Yeah!...Getting there's downhill and all the saints help you. But coming back! The saints stand there watching you, that's all! God's will be done.

1 So what'd they say?	The army says that, as a war orphan, I don't have to serve in the military, but nothing can be done. It's a bureaucratic error. I have to leave. Day after tomorrow morning. They're sending me to Rome. But they'll discharge me ten days later. Let's go...

1 I don't remember him any moreMa, where's Russia?	It takes years to get there. And years to come back...Now go to bed, Toto, it's late.

1 Mr. Bernstein, Mr. Thatcher -	How are you, Mr. Thatcher?

1 Three cents.	Two cents.

1 So then, tonight, we go over everything thoroughly, eh?  Especially the new papers -	We certainly do.  Vacation's over - starting right after dinner.  But right now - that lady over there -  - that's the new society editor, I take it?  You think I could interrupt her a moment, Mr. Bernstein?
2 Huh?  Oh, I forgot - you've been away so long I forgot about your joking -

1 Wasted?	Charlie?!
2 You just made the paper over four times today, Mr. Kane.  That's all -

1 Well, he'll be coming back in September. The Majestic.  I got the reservations. It gets in on the ninth.	September the ninth?

1 I'm still hungry, Brad.  Let's go to Rector's and get something decent.  The "Chronicle" has a two-column headline, Mr. Carter.  Why haven't we?	There is no news big enough.
2 If the headline is big enough, it makes the new big enough.  The murder of Mrs. Harry Silverstone -	As a matter of fact, we sent a man to the Silverstone home yesterday afternoon.  Our man even arrived before the "Chronicle" reporter.  And there's no proof that the woman was murdered - or even that she's dead.
3 The "Chronicle" doesn't say she's murdered, Mr. Carter.  It says the neighbors are getting suspicious.	It's not our function to report the gossip of housewives.  If we were interested in that kind of thing, Mr. Kane, we could fill the paper twice over daily -
4 That's the kind of thing we are going to be interested in from now on, Mr. Carter.  Right now, I wish you'd send your best man up to see Mr. Silverstone.  Have him tell Mr. Silverstone if he doesn't produce his wife at once, the "Enquirer" will have him arrested.  Have him tell Mr. Silverstone he's a detective from the Central Office. If Mr. Silverstone asks to see his badge, your man is to get indignant and call Mr. Silverstone an anarchist. Loudly, so that the neighbors can hear.	Really, Mr. Kane, I can't see the function of a respectable newspaper -

1 What story, Mr. Rogers?	The story about him and Miss Alexander, Mrs. Kane.

1 I'm sending Junior home in the car, Charles - with Oliver -	But I'd arranged to go home with you myself.
2 There's a call I want you to make with me, Charles.	It can wait.
3 No, it can't.  Good night, darling.

1 Charlie, you're just excited.  You don't realize -	I know exactly what I'm doing.  Get out!

1 Where's the towel?	On the chiffonier.  Here.
2 Thanks.	I've got a brush in the closet.  As soon as the mud on your trousers is all dry - you just brush it off.
3 I'll get these streets fixed, if it's the last thing I do.

1 Don't you realize that everybody here is going to know about this? That you've packed your bags and ordered the car and -	- And left?  Of course they'll hear.  I'm not saying goodbye - except to you - but I never imagined that people wouldn't know.

1 You goin', Mom?	Your mother won't be going right away, Charles -
2 Where'm I going?

1 Close the door, Raymond.	Yes, sir. 
2 Lock it - and keep it locked.

1 Well, gentlemen, are we going to war?	Our readers are, anyway, I don't know about the rest of the country.
2 It'll be our first foreign war in fifty years, Brad.  We'll cover it the way the "Hickville Gazette" covers the church social!  The names of everybody there; what they wore; what they ate; who won the prizes; who gave the prizes -  I tell you, Brad, I envy you.  By Bradford Leland, the "Enquirer's" Special Correspondent at the Front. I'm almost tempted -	But there is no Front, Charlie. There's a very doubtful civil war. Besides, I don't want the job.
3 All right, Brad, all right - you don't have to be a war correspondent unless you want to - I'd want to.  Hello, Georgie.

1 I'll tell you what I'll do, Brad - I'll get drunk, too - maybe that'll help.	No, that won't help.  Besides, you never get drunk.  I wanted to talk about you and Emily.

1 We'll withdraw support completely. Anything else?	Mr. Leland sent back that check.
2 What check?	You made it out to him last week after he left for Chicago.
3 Oh, yes, the bonus.	It was for twenty-five thousand dollars.

1 Brief marriage!  Ten years! 	Was he in love?
2 He married for love -  That's why he did everything.  That's why he went into politics.  It seems we weren't enough.  He wanted all the voters to love him, too.  All he really wanted out of life was love. That's Charlie's story - it's the story of how he lost it.  You see, he just didn't have any to give.  He loved Charlie Kane, of course, very dearly - and his mother, I guess he always loved her.  As for Emily - well, all I can tell you is Emily's story as she told it to me, which probably isn't fair - there's supposed to be two sides to every story - and I guess there are.  I guess there's more than two sides -

1 Thompson!	Yes, sir.
2 Hold this thing up for a week.  Two weeks if you have to...	But don't you think if we release it now - he's only been dead four days - it might be better than if -
3 Nothing is ever better than finding out what makes people tick.  Go after the people that knew Kane well.  That manager of his - the little guy, Bernstein, those two wives, all the people who knew him, had worked for him, who loved him, who hated his guts -  I don't mean go through the City Directory, of course -

1 I did a lot of singing after that. I sang for Charlie -  I sang for teachers at a hundred bucks an hour - the teachers got that, I didn't -	What did you get?
2 What do you mean?

1 Jesus!	It's a picture of a cancer-ridden lung. Keep it.
2 I'll just take the gum.

1 Hey Caitlin...  Break his heart again this time, and I'll kill you. Nothing personal.	You're very protective of him, Randal. You always have been.
2 Territoriality. He was mine first.	Awww. That was so cute.

1 And the fact that there weren't any lights made it so...  God! That was so great!	It wasn't me.
2 Yeah, right. Who was it: Randal?	Was it you?

1 What about Caitlin?	Shock trauma. She's going to need years of therapy after this. My question is, How did she come to have sex with the dead man?
2 She thought it was me.

1 I'M GONNA BREAK YOUR FUCKING HEAD! YOU FUCKING JERKOFF!	Sir! Sir, I'm sorry! He didn't mean it! He was trying to get me.
2 Well, he missed!	I know. I'm sorry. Let me refund your cigarette money, and we'll call it even.
3 This is the last time I ever come here.  And if I ever see you again, I'm gonna break your fucking head open!

1 You open?	Yeah.

1 You don't want to know.	You called Caitlin again?
2 She called me.	Did you tell Veronica?
3 One fight a day with Veronica is about all I can stomach, thanks.	What do you two fight about?
4 I guess it's not really fighting. She just wants me to leave here, go back to school, get some direction.	I'll bet the most frequent topic of arguments is Caitlin Bree.
5 You win.	I'm going to offer you some advice, my friend: let the past be the past. Forget Caitlin Bree. You've been with Veronica for how long now?
6 Seven months.	Chick's nuts about you. How long did you date Caitlin?
7 Five years.	Chick only made you nuts. She cheated on you how many times?
8 Eight and a half.	Eight and a half?
9 Party at John K's-senior year. I get blitzed and pass out in his bedroom. Caitlin comes in and dives all over me.	That's cheating?
10 In the middle of it, she calls me Brad.	She called you Brad?
11 She called me Brad.	That's not cheating. People say crazy shit during sex. One time, I called this girl "Mom."
12 I hit the lights and she freaks. Turns out she thought I was Brad Michaelson.	What do you mean?
13 She was supposed to meet Brad Michaelson in a bedroom. She picked the wrong one. She had no idea I was even at the party.	Oh, my God.
14 Great story, isn't it?	That girl was vile to you.
15 Interesting postscript to that story: Do you know who wound up going with Brad Michaelson in the other dark bedroom?	Your mother.
16 Allan Harris.	Chess team Allan Harris?!
17 The two moved to Idaho together after graduation. They raise sheep.	That's frightening.
18 It takes different strokes to move the world.	In light of this lurid tale, I don't see how you could even romanticize your relationship with Caitlin-she broke your heart and inadvertently drove men to deviant lifestyles.
19 Because there was a lot of good in our relationship.	Oh yeah.
20 I'm serious. Aside from the cheating, we were a great couple.  That's what high school's all about-algebra, bad lunch, and infidelity.	You think things would be any different now?
21 They are. When she calls me now, she's a different person-she's frightened and vulnerable. She's about to finish college and enter the real world. That's got to be scary for anyone.	Oh shit, I've got to place an order.
22 I'm talking to myself here.	No, no, I'm listening. She's leaving college, and...?
23 ...and she's looking to me for support. And I think that this is leading our relationship to a new level.	What about Veronica?
24 I think the arguments Veronica and I are having are some kind of manifestation of a subconscious desire to break away from her so that I can pursue the possibility of a more meaningful relationship with Caitlin.	Caitlin's on the same wave-length?
25 I think it's safe to say yes.	Then I think all four of you had better sit down and talk it over.
26 All four?	You, Veronica, Caitlin...  ...and Caitlin's fianc.

1 Why do you do things like that? You know she's going to come back and tell the boss.	Who cares? That lady's an asshole. Everybody that comes in here is way too uptight. This job would be great if it wasn't for the fucking customers.
2 I'm gonna hear it tomorrow.	You gotta loosen up, my friend. You'd feel a hell of a lot better if you'd rip into the occasional customer.
3 What for? They don't bother me if I don't bother them.	Liar! Tell me there aren't customers that annoy the piss out of you on a daily basis.
4 There aren't.	How can you lie like that? Why don't you vent? Vent your frustration. Come on, who pisses you off?
5 It's not really anyone per se, it's more of separate groupings.	Let's hear it.
6 The milkmaids.	The milkmaids?

1 Helluva game!	One ball!! They come all the way here... I close the damn store... for one ball!
2 Hockey's hockey. At least we got to play.	Randal, twelve minutes is not a game! Jesus, it's barely a warm-up!
3 Bitch, bitch, bitch. You want something to drink? 	Gatorade.

1 Let me borrow your car.	I don't want to talk to you.
2 Fine. Just lend me your car.	Why should I loan you my car?
3 I want to rent a movie.	You want to rent a movie.

1 Maybe the Asian design major slipped her some opium?	Could be.

1 I threw out the stuff that got broken. The floor looks clean.	You need a ride?
2 Got one. Just pulled up.

1 I am not.	How much can you bench?
2 I don't know.

1 I work, just like you. You're more of a crook than I am, dude.	How do you figure... HEY! You can't roll a joint in here!
2 Relax brother. What I mean is that you sell the stuff in this store at the highest prices around. A dollar seventy-nine for wraps-what's that shit?	It's not my store.
3 And these aren't my drugs-I just sell them.	The difference is you exploit a weakness.
4 What's that mean?	You sell to people that can't stay away from an addiction.
5 All right. How much is Pepsi here?	A dollar sixty-nine, plus tax.
6 At Food City it's ninety-nine cents, plus tax.	So.
7 So why do you sell it for so much more? I'll tell you why-because people come here and they're like "A dollar eighty for soda? I should get it at Food City. But I don't feel like driving there. I'll just buy it here so I don't have to drive up there." That's exploiting a weakness, too, isn't it?	I can't believe you just rolled a joint in here.
8 Hey, man, what happened with that old guy?	He died in the bathroom.
9 That's fucked up. Yo, I heard he was jerkin' off.	I don't know. I wasn't watching.
10 Probably saw that Caitlin chick. I know I felt like beatin' it when I saw her.  Come here, bitch! You like this? Is this what you want? Hunhh?	Knock it off. That used to be my girlfriend.
11 You used to go out with her?	We were going to start again, I think.
12 Don't you already have a girlfriend?	Veronica.
13 Is she that girl who's down here all the time? She came here today carrying a plate of food.	Lasagne.
14 And what-you were gonna dump her to date that Caitlin chick?	Maybe.
15 I don't know dude. That Caitlin chick's nice. But I see that Veronica girl doing shit for you all the time. She brings you food, she rubs your back... Didn't I see her change your tire one day?	I jacked the car up. All she did was loosen the nuts and put the tire on.
16 Damn. She sure goes out of her way.	She's my girlfriend.
17 I've had girlfriends, but all they wanted from me was weed and shit.  Shit, my grandma used to say, "Which is better: a good plate with nothing on it..." No, wait. I fucked up. She said "What's a good-looking plate with nothing on it?"	Meaning?
18 I don't know. She was senile and shit. Used to piss herself all the time. C'mon Silent Bob.

1 What the hell was that for?	You're a pig.
2 Why'd you hit me?	Do you know how many different men I've had sex with?
3 Do I get to hit you after you tell me?	Three.
4 Three?	Three including you.
5 You've only had sex with three different people?	I'm not the pig you are.
6 Who?	You!
7 No; who were the three, besides me?	John Franson and Rob Stanslyk.
8 Wow. That's great. That's something to be proud of.	I am. And that's why you should feel like a pig. You men make me sick. You'll sleep with anything that says yes.
9 Animal, vegetable, or mineral.	Vegetable meaning paraplegic.
10 They put up the least amount of struggle.	After dropping a bombshell like that, you owe me. Big.
11 All right. Name it.	I want you to come with me on Monday.
12 Where?	To school. There's a seminar about getting back into a scholastic program after a lapse in enrollment.
13 Can't we ever have a discussion without that coming up?	It's important to me, Dante. You have so much potential that just goes to waste in this pit. I wish you'd go back to school.
14 Jesus, would you stop? You make my head hurt when you talk about this.

1 You're damn right it's not like that! Because I won't let it be like that! You want your slut? Fine!  The slut is yours!	I don't want Caitlin...
2 You don't know what you want, but I'm not going to sit here anymore holding your hand until you figure it out! I've encouraged you to get out of this fucking dump and go back to school, to take charge of your life and find direction. I even transferred so maybe you would be more inclined to go back to college if I was with you. Everyone said it was a stupid move, but I didn't care because I loved you and wanted to see you pull yourself out of this senseless funk you've been in since that whore dumped you, oh so many years ago. And now you want to go back to her so she can fuck you over some more?	I don't want to go back with her...
3 Of course not; not now! You're caught, and now you're trying to snake out of doing what you wanted to do. Well, I won't let you. I want you to follow through on this, just so you can find out what a fucking idiot you are. And when she dumps you again- and she will, Dante, I promise you that-when she dumps you again, I want to laugh at you, right in your face, just so you realize that that was what you gave up our relationship for!  I'm just glad Randal had the balls to tell me, since you couldn't.	Randal...?
4 And having him tell me... that was just the weakest move ever. You're spineless.	Veronica, I love you...
5 Fuck you.

1 He only speaks Russian?	He knows some English, but he can't not speak it good like we do.

1 I think the lady called it.	My ex-boyfriend was about his height, but he was much bulkier. He could bench two-fifty, three hundred easy.
2 I do about three-fifty, four.	No way!
3 Feel that.	That's tight. Solid.
4 Now feel his.  Roll up your sleeve, chief.

1 I just held up the same two movies. You're not even paying attention.	No, I wasn't.
2 I don't think your manager would appreciate...	I don't appreciate your ruse, ma'am.
3 I beg your pardon!	Your ruse. Your cunning attempt to trick me.
4 I only pointed out that you weren't paying any attention to what I was saying.	I hope it feels good.
5 You hope what feels good?	I hope it feels so good to be right. There is nothing more exhilarating than pointing out the shortcomings of others, is there?

1 "It's a perfect day for a monster jump."  Hey man, can you like do me a favor?	What?
2 Next time you're like watching MTV, y' know, like flip it to the weather channel for a split second and check it out.  I mean, hey, we could be home watching some righteous pornos.	That woulda been cool.
3 Exactly, cheesehead, exactly.

1 Hey, Jessie, you're just in time for another masterpiece.	So, what do you see?
2 Surprise me.	What usually eats a banana?
3 A monkey?	So...what are you, blind, son? This is a banana eating a monkey, nature in reverse.
4 Y'know, Jessie, doesn't Frank look like a normal guy--but he's not,  are you Frank?

1 Remember, keep your arms and legs within the vehicle at all times--	Hey, fuck you.

1 Room service...Hi, Sarah.	Hi, Gabe.

1 Do you see them yet?	Patience my love, patience.
2 That's a virtue isn't it?	Wait, I think I have them sighted.  What's the word, Frank?

1 I know you don't want to be responsible for anybody's life anymore, but walk away and you are responsible.  Please Gabe, he went up the west ridge.  If you go up the south face, you can catch him, no problem--	Can't do it.

1 Gabe...your arm?	Yeah?
2 If you're not using your arm, can I borrow it?	Sure, just give it back when you're done.

1 We might be able to go that way.	Forget it.  If that charge goes off before we can reach it, this whole damn crevice will slam shut on us.  This way.

1 Just kidding.	Gabe?  Wait 'til I get over there.  Tie the rope so I can come across.
2 Can't do it.  Now go back and get help!

1 Souvenirs?  No, wrong answer. Looks like your friend plans on hanging around, that possible?	No, he's gone.
2 No, he's close, and he's using our money to keep you alive. Nobody's worth that much on the open market.  Except you, the loyal one.  Didn't I tell you to warm the place up?

1 What's your names?	Tucker and Walker.
2 Tucker and Walker, we've lost three bags.

1 Oh, my God!	Climb, Gabe, climb!

1 Where's the third one, Travers?	There, what's that place?

1 This is insane.  The hell with the money.  You radio in for that chopper, understand!	Hey, you dealt us this hand, we're playing it all the way. Move.

1 One minoota, droogie. Dim smashes Alex in the face with a full milk bottle. He goes down. The others run away, laughing.	You bastards... bastards.

1 It's past eight, Alex, you don't want to be late for school, son.	Bit of pain in the gulliver, Mum. Leave us be and I'll try to sleep it off... then I'll be as right as dodgers for this after.
2 You've not been to school all week, son.	I've got to rest, Mum... got to get fit, otherwise I'm liable to miss a lot more school.
3 Eeee... I'll put your breakfast in the oven. I've got to be off myself now.	Alright, Mum... have a nice day at the factory.

1 Who said that?	I did, sir.
2 What crime did you commit.	The accidental killing of a person, sir.

1 You are now in H.M. Prison Parkmoor and from this moment you will address all prison officers as sir! Name?	Alexander de Large, sir.
2 Crime?	Murder, sir.
3 Right. Take the cuffs off him, Mister. The cuffs are removed.

1 Well, that was a very promising start. By my calculations, you should be starting to feel alright again. Yes? Dr. Brodsky's pleased with you. Now tomorrow there'll be two sessions, of course, morning and afternoon.	You mean, I have to viddy two sessions in one day?
2 I imagine you'll be feeling a little bit limp by the end of the day. But we have to be hard on you. You have to be cured.	But it was horrible.
3 Well, of course, it was horrible. Violence is a very horrible thing. That's what you're learning now. Your body is learning it.	I just don't understand about feeling sick the way I did. I never used to feel sick before. I used to feel like the very opposite. I mean, doing it or watching it, I used to feel real horrorshow. I just don't understand why, how what.
4 You felt ill this afternoon because you're getting better. You see, when we're healthy we respond to the presence of the hateful with fear and nausea. You're becoming healthy that's all. By this time tomorrow you'll be healthier still.

1 One jacket - blue pinstripe.	Prison custody?

1 Moloko-plus.	Something to sharpen us up, you especially. We have the start.

1 Hi ya' doin'?  Where to?	Park Avenue and East 2nd. Take Centre to Canal, up the Bowery, Cooper and Third, left on 41st, come around on Park.

1 Thanks for everything, Max.  Wow...	Sure thing.

1 No.	Oh, my, yes.
2 Get outta here!  You and Louis?	Fella owned this place back then, Dix Dwyer, he let slip to Louis that I played.  So Pops, he just waves me right up.  My heart about stopped. But I got up there all the same, and we played for nearly twenty minutes.
3 Unbelievable...  ...you hearing this?  Unbelievable.

1 What?	I think...  ...I think you should get this gun out of my fucking face.
2 What?  What did you say?	I said.  Get the gun.  Out.  Of my fucking <u>face.</u> Before I wrap it in a blintz and feed it to you.

1 What are you gonna do?	Take him down.  Save Richard Yip, our witness...

1 Client?  I like to think of myself as more of a friend.  A mentor.	Max never had many friends.  So much with the piano.  Always keeping to himself, it's unhealthy...

1 ...oh God, don't shoot me...	...show me the wallet, man, get your ass up, <u>up</u>...

1 ...why is everything always about you...	...everything is not about me, don't make me the villain here.  That asshole was out of line, and you goddamn well know it...
2 ...I'm sorry, I don't see it that way...	...oh, bullshit!  He was intruding on my space, he was demeaning me personally, he was patronizing...
3 ...what do you want me to do, punch him out?  I have to work with him...	...well, last I checked, you were <u>sleeping</u> with me, so unless you wanna start fucking the guy soon, I'd suggest an attitude shift...

1 I think he's dead.	No shit.  Since he has two .45s double- tapped through the sternum and fell six floors onto his head...

1 You listening to me?	Yes!  I'm trying, I swear!
2 Try harder.  I'm gonna count to three. One...	Two...
3 It's not me, it's the engine!  A fat guy fell on it from six floors up!

1 I don't know any Rwandans.	You don't know the guy in the trunk, either.  If it makes you feel better, he was a villain involved in a Continuing Criminal Enterprise.
2 Oh, it's okay, then.  'Cause you're just taking out the garbage...	Yeah, like that...  But, anyway, nobody gets out of this alive.  Even if we quit smoking and cut out red meat.  Everybody dies.

1 I had no idea these cabs came equipped with emergency strobes.  Where's the button?  Under the dash?	Yeah.

1 Show up for <u>what?</u>	She's in the hospital.
2 You go every night?	What difference does it make?
3 Guy with a routine goes and breaks it? Provokes attention.  That's bad.  And that's not good...	There's no way I'm taking you to see my mother!

1 Damn, Max.  I'm impressed.  Really.  I would have bet good money you wouldn't walk out of there.	Makes two of us.

1 What happened?	Guy came in with a gunshot wound, but he died of a heart attack.  Go figure.

1 <u>Jerry</u>?  You didn't show last night.  First time ever.  Had me worried, boy.	Sorry, Flip.  Got sidetracked.

1 It's a man without a nose you want, you dumb complicit sons of bitches!  You've got to listen to me.	Put down the gun and I'll take your statement.  Okay?
2 You're the boss.  Just don't make me repeat myself.  I hate that.

1 What took so long?  You were in there all day.	That's how long it takes to turn a hospital inside out.  A lot of people are after you, Jerry.
2 Dead or alive, they'll stick me in there with Oswald.  Another lunatic acting alone,	Oswald was an assassin.  You're not an assassin, are you, Jerry?
3 If you're worried about the President, call and warn him about the Space Shuttle.	Right.  Sit up so I can see you.
4 Uh uh, don't want <u>them</u> to see me.	Them who?
5 Change lanes.  Then watch your rearview.

1 You okay?	Flesh wound.  No big deal.

1 You gave me an hour; now give me a day.	Jerry, there's something I have to ask you.  Actually about a hundred things, but we can make progress, if you answer one question.  To my satisfaction.
2 Shoot.	It was that painting.  The one on the wall.
3 I didn't mean for you to see it. It's like looking in someone's diary and taking it out of context.  Know what I mean?	It made me feel like you could see inside of me.  And I don't know how that's possible.
4 So what's the question?	How is it possible?

1 Answer me.  Was the first time you saw me the first time I saw you? Was it?  You've been following me around.  Do you see how that could be disconcerting to me?  That's not love, Jerry.  It's obsession. And it isn't normal and you can't expect me to respond to it and you can't expect me to feel the same way.  Can you?	I would never hurt you, Liza. Think whatever you want, but don't think that.
2 I don't.  I know you wouldn't.	I thought you -- Why -- Love ruins everything, doesn't it?

1 Liza?	Did you kill him?
2 Is that what they told you?	Did you kill my father?

1 Without a song in my heart.	Without a love of my own.

1 Do I know you?	Yes you do, Jerry.  Quite well.

1 Veritas.  Truth.  What is it they say about truth?	The truth shall make you free.
2 That's it.  I went to Yale.  I hope you won't hold that against me.	Only on the football field.

1 In Jerry's safety deposit box.	I don't understand.

1 Go to the northeast corner.  Call a cab.  Bring the pizza.  Then there's a poem.  Roses are red, violets are blue, if the Pope goes to Washington, I would, too.	What the hell does that mean?

1 Who's the Deputy Director of the F.B.I.?	You think we have time to fool around like this?  Come on.

1 Mike, because of the Earth's rotation we're only in line with Vega so many hours a day; the only way to get the whole message is to cooperate with other stations.  If Dr. Arroway hadn't moved quickly we could have lost key elements.	Okay, fine, they've got the primes -- but if you're right about there being another more significant transmission still to come --

1 ... could it be a nested code of some sort?	You must have checked the signal for polarization modulation already...

1 They knew our level of development. If, as you say, they've done this many times they'd be well aware of the implications.	Maybe they are.  Maybe this is all part of the package.  The building of the machine has demanded international cooperation on an unprecedented scale.  Maybe requiring us to come together in this way was, in effect, part of the plan.

1 There's no way of knowing.  Without a key -- a primer, to help us, maybe never.	Maybe it'll be at the end of the data when the message recycles.

1 Okay, let's just slow down.  Pull up the starfield signal origin.	It can't be coming from Vega, the system's too young.

1 So why don't you admit what by your own standards must be the truth: that this experience simply didn't happen.	Because I can't.

1 Am I one... or many?	The librarian... or the library...?

1 What's that?	Japanese squid fleet.  They use lights to attract them to the surface... then turn them into sushi.

1 ... I'm just so sick of feeling defensive about the things I care about!  Or being lumped in with the lunatic fringe by people like Drumlin, when if they'd just put aside their preconceptions for two seconds and look at the facts...	They can't.  I think it's against human nature to admit to that level of... insignificance; to not see yourself as basically the center of the universe.
2 It's like the pre-Copernicans who swore the sun revolved around the Earth, or the Victorians at the end of the last century who concluded that all major discoveries had now been made.  I mean... try to imagine civilization a thousand years ahead of us -- then imagine trying to explain... I dunno, a microwave oven -- to someone even a hundred years ago -- I mean the basic concepts didn't exist...	'Any sufficiently advanced technology...'
3 '... is indistinguishable from magic.'

1 Champagne please.	Make that two.

1 Do you really believe your life is meaningless?	I don't know.  But as a scientist I have to consider that possibility.
2 And yet you're willing to die for this cause, the one thing that's given your life a sense of purpose. Don't you see the contradiction here -- ?	It's getting late...
3 What are you so afraid of, Ellie?

1 So.  I'm assuming they sent you here to administer last rites?	I'm not sure it's come to that.
2 They don't believe me.	I do.
3 You're sure you want to?  In the universe I saw we're not exactly the stars of the show.  What happened to me makes us all seem pretty damn small.	It also makes God enormous.  I think of the scope of your universe, Ellie... and it takes my breath away.  As it will everyone else's.
4 I don't have any proof, Palmer.	Ellie, you're the proof.  You tell them your story.  Ultimately they'll have no choice but to believe you.
5 It's not enough, don't you understand?  I know it happened -- but by every standard of science, by every standard I've lived my life by that fact is utterly beside the point.  It may be true but it doesn't matter because I can't prove it's real.	Ellie, the only one holding you to that standard is you!  The people want to hear your story, they need to hear it!
6 But --	Have you seen what's happening out there?  The terror, the despair? The world is on fire, Ellie.  People need something they can believe in, something worthy, and you can give it to them!
7 I want to, Palmer -- more than anything.  But it has to be real. It has to be true.	Ellie... if you go out there like this -- if you admit to even the possibility that what you experienced didn't actually happen -- I'm afraid they really will crucify you.  Please.  For your own sake, for the sake of the world... tell them what you know to be the truth.  Tell them it really happened.

1 I'm lucky I got a broom. Work up top. Real easy job. Man, it's gonna be hot down in that ditch.	We work down in the ditch?

1 You allus had good jobs, and that girl in Kentucky I taken a shine to her.	She took off with that convertible feller...
2 Well, why not? Idee of marryin' got you all choked up, trying to pretend you was respectable you was borin' the hell out of all of us.	Yeah.
3 I'm leavin' the place to John.	That's good: he earned it.
4 Nothin' to do with it. I ain't never give John the kind of feelin' I give you, so I'm payin' him off now. Don't feel you got to say anything. Way it is, sometimes, you just have a feelin' for a child or you don't, and with John I just didn't.	Gotta go, Arletta.
5 Laugh it up, kid. You'll make out.

1 What's all this dirt in the yard?	I... I... I...

1 You gonna get used to wearing them chains aftera while, Luke. But don't you never stop listenin' to them clinkin'. That's gonna remind you of what I been sayin'.	Yeah, they sure do make a lot of cold, hard, noise, Captain.

1 She looks just like Mrs. Patricia Handy, a married woman... I useta fool with. Man, I kin sniff blondes from a hunnert yards and redheads from a mile and a half.	Drag's been chain-ganging so long he's got a nose like a bloodhound.

1 Oh lookit that brunette.	Mah baby! We're diggin' and dyin' but our boy Luke is lovin' and flyin'.

1 Slow down, man. They ain't passing out medals for slinging dirt.	I thought you knew, boy... they sentenced me by the mile.

1 Where'd the road go?	That's it. That's the end.

1 Not a liar. You just have a common -- and likable -- tendency toward exaggeration.	He's the champeen hog-gut of this camp. Hell, I seen him eat ten choc'lat bars and seven cold drinks in fifteen minutes. He kin eat busted bottles and rusty nails, any damn thing. If you'd so kindly oblige as to let me cut off your yankee head, he'd even eat that.

1 Man! It's gonna be one hot muther today.	Bears gonna be walkin' the road today.

1 Yeah, found one in this supermarket, keys in the ignition.	Well, how far didya get?
2 Fat mile'n a half. Hit this red light, highway patrol pulls up alongside.

1 Excuse me, but would you mind explaining why you're watching the lady upstairs?	None of your fucking business.

1 You parked right behind him.  The one I noticed earlier.  I didn't say anything, I thought he'd leave. Just take a look.	Oh my God!  Help!  HE'S READING A NEWSPAPER!
2 But earlier, he was staring up here.  <u>Please</u>, Andy.	Okay.  You win.  'Dirty Harry' coming up.

1 You bastard!	But </u>alive</u>!

1 Who are you?	Inspector Halloran.  Homicide. You were supposed to contact a Peter Kurten?
2 I was?  How you spell that?	Cut the crap.  You got a sheet the length of my arm...
3 I never hurt nobody...	Shut up -- I'm talking.  You got felony breaking and entering, burglary, felonious...
4 I never carried a gun!

1 What was that?  What am I hearing? The sound of an epiphany, a sudden blinding insight?	It's Daryll Lee Cullum, isn't it?
2 Mm-hmm.  I can't get to you.  You have to come to me.	You know I can't do that.
3 Oh, I think you will.

1 Sugar and cream for Goetz; I take mine black.  You're absolutely correct.  The politicians don't want panic headlines spoiling the Festival of Love.	Well, let's thank God you and Inspector Goetz are on the case, then.
2 Would you want to work with us on this?	Oh, my God, no!  I'm a clinical hysteric, with panic syndrome, and anxiety neurosis, agoraphobic, I'm afraid of everything, real and imaginary.  I never leave this apartment now.  Nobody ever comes here.  I just wanted to get your attention.  I write and I used to lecture on these crimes, but... I'm not competent.
3 I think you are.  I really admire everything you've done; it would be an honor to work with you, and we need all the help we can get, especially yours.	Inspector Halloran, that is so much bullshit, you don't like or admire me, but the beautiful part is I don't give a fuck.  That's the upside of having a breakdown.
4 Well, it's a hell of an apartment you got here.  I'm living one step away from the projects, myself, but I get to go to work every day, wading in blood and guts.  I guess the books you wrote about these sons of bitches paid off pretty good.	Will you go.  Andy, make them go.
5 You can't go out lecturing?  Tough shit.  Women are dying.  Where can I lay this stuff out?

1 It's <u>anybody</u> connected to author- ity.  They write, they even knock on your door.  They're <u>fans</u>.  It thrills them to flirt with getting caught.	Nobody knows you have anything to do with this case; nothing has been on TV or the news... Why would he want to get in <u>your</u> computer?
2 Because I'm his damned pin-up girl! His, all of them!  They know me. They're in prisons with libraries, they collect clippings, I'm their worthy opponent.  You keep my name out of this.

1 What's that siren?	One of those goddamned car alarms. What's going...
2 Ruben's gone to look... It's banged up but it looks like a .44.  It's Son of Sam.  Is it Son of Sam?	Look in the crowd.  He liked to hang around and watch the cops at work...

1 How many do you need to sleep. Really sheep?	W-We had a fight.  I called him... called him a name...
2 Christ, Helen.  The first time, we're ahead of the son of a bitch! I can't leave you like this -- and there's no time.  Knock yourself out.

1 We're through for the night, aren't we?  You go on.  Get some sleep. I'll stay until we can get a man out here and maybe catch a cab home.	That would be much appreciated. Thanks.

1 Open the door.  Please.	Why don't you shoot off the lock?

1 What am I wasting my time with this shit for?	Because it's your job, that's all.
2 Not what I meant; why <u>me</u>?	Maybe it's something you did in this life, Nikko...

1 Get Mercer to run the medical, dental, legal bills, laundry and dry cleaning receipts, extermin- ators, mailmen, grocery and drugstore deliveries, handymen, plumbers...	It's mostly done, they got nobody in common, the three of them... No mutual friends -- the Landlady says nobody was ever there, she never saw her with anybody.

1 Get the pictures, and casts of footprints.	Look at him, grandstanding...

1 There was no sperm.	The same as the firs two. Definitely a serial.
2 What are you looking at that for? Helen Hudson.  Work the clues.	What clues?  I'm going to work Helen Hudson.
3 Would you step outside, Sergeant?

1 You want mine, too?  You take his, you take mine.  I'm the one fucked it up...	So I'm maybe gonna lose three good cops?  You fucked up on this occasion, but don't be so hard on yourself.  There's something I want you to think about.  The book says if you use your gun, use it to kill, that's what it's meant to do. You tried to pick this punk off with fancy shooting, to keep him alive.  To what end?  You're not willing to kill, you can't be a cop.  Go get drunk.  I am.

1 Where were you?	In the private aircraft hangar. Anybody could have walked in.
2 Did you come?	No. What about your camera girl? Did she come?
3 We were interrupted. I had to go back to the set...

1 He must have tucked a lot of women in that huge car of his. It's like a bed on wheels. It must smell of semen...	It does.
2 Do you find him attractive?	He's very pale. Covered with scars.
3 Would you like to tuck him, though? In that car?	No. But when he's in that car...
4 Have you seen his penis?	I think it's badly scarred too. From a motorcycle accident.
5 Is he circumcised? Can you imagine what his anus is like? Describe it to me. Would you like to sodomize him? Would you like to put your penis right into his anus, thrust it up his anus? Tell me, describe it to me. Tell me what you would do. How would you kiss him in that car? Describe how you'd reach over and unzip his greasy jeans, then take out his penis. Would you kiss it or suck it right away? Which hand would you hold it in? Have you ever sucked a penis? Do you know what semen tastes like? Have you ever tasted semen? Some semen is saltier than others. Vaughan's semen must be very salty...

1 The airport? Why? Are you leaving?	Not yet - though not soon enough for some people, I've already found. A death in the doctor's family makes the patients doubly uneasy.
2 I take it you're not wearing white to reassure them.	I'll wear a bloody kimono if I want to.
3 So - why the airport?	I work in the immigration department there.

1 What does he want from you?	Hard to say.
2 I'm going to leave now. Do you want a lift?	No, thanks. I'll go with Vaughan.

1 I'm the only doctor making rounds this morning.	Well, I don't have hallucinations. Honest.
2 This doctor, was he tall, with dark hair?	Yeah, and a dimple.

1 So, we'll meet every Tuesday and Friday. And if you have any kind of emergency, you can page me.	OK, good. That's good. Thanks an awful lot for everything, and for coming down here to see me off.
2 It was just a little going-away gesture.	I have a going-away gesture for you, too.
3 Oh?

1 Where's the old bag I sometimes call Mommy?	She said she'd be here at 10.

1 Letty, dinner's almost ready.   The souffle...	I'll be back before you can say souffle.

1 Are you sure, Dear?	Come on.

1 It's so good to see you, Sweetheart.	You too, Mom.
2 You're looking good.    A little thin, but good.

1 Michael just got a job.    Couldn't you congratulate him?	I will, Dear. I promise.  Why McDonald's?
2 He's been looking everywhere for weeks, Mom.   It's not that easy after you've been locked away.

1 No, 79. Sorry, this makes me nervous.	It's OK. It's not a pass-fail kind of thing.

1 You missed out on some great broccoli florets at dinner.	I wasn't hungry.
2 John even managed to lob a load of mashed potatoes into Mrs. Hallstrom's milk.	Finally. I was getting tired of watching him try every night.
3 Was it bad news--the visit from Peter?	Paul.

1 Thanks.    Where've you been all day?	Back-to-back sessions with the shrink.

1 Well?	Home free.

1 You've got to see the kitchen first.	Do you like it?
2 I love your apartment.	Really?

1 Gosh, Letty, this is a great place.	Thanks.

1 How may I help you?	Congratulations.

1 I sure know what that feels like.	And all the plans we have.
2 Yeah, the plans.

1 So, another one bites the dust.	It's not another one. It's my sister.  Aren't you happy for her?
2 She's only known the guy a few months.

1 It's just I've got those parent conferences, and I'm supposed to set up the math program by next week. And shopping for Ruth's dress and that, that engagement dinner.	You can get out of the dinner.
2 No, I can't. I've already convinced both Mom and Dad to come.	Come on, Letty.   It'll get done.

1 Sure. We'll save the formal announcement for when you're out. I already told your mother. I hope you don't mind.	No, no.
2 So will you?	Of course. Yes. I will.     I do.

1 Well, I understand.     I know my behavior was poor.	So, in light of how the parents feel, and the fact the students are doing so well with the substitute, I don't think I can put you back in the classroom just yet.
2 Look, Gail, I've been a good teacher.	I know, Letty. But the incident with Zach was frightening for the children.  Now if you'd come to me, explained what was going on...
3 Believe me, I wish I'd understood what was going on. I've worked really hard to get better.	I'm glad you're doing well.
4 I've already thought about how to tell the kids where I was.

1 What the fuck was all that about at the hotel last night? I thought we had a deal?	Hey, you're not exactly the most trustworthy guy in the world. I took a shot. It didn't work. Did you bring the tapes?

1 You've already robbed the safe?	Oui.
2 Take what you've got and get out of there.

1 They're gonna be what?	Supernumerary. It means better than expected.
2 Good word.

1 Tonight?	I know they won't be home tonight.

1 Why is everything an argument with you?	I'm just setting my boundaries.

1 Turn on the flashlight.	I'm trying.    It doesn't work.

1 You call being Bastaldi's lap dog better?	Better than spending my life crawling through windows in the middle of the night.

1 They'll be waiting for us at the airport.	You steal some money from a man he gets over it in time. But these tapes. He's never going to stop looking for us.
2 We have to find Sophie.

1 Did you have to use that much explosive?	I promised Bonanno I'd destroy the tapes.

1 Hey boss, it's not a science.	Send some flowers. Something nice. Roses or carnations. And one of those get well soon cards.

1 There's an exterior alarm system. There's also another one in the hall that leads to the bedroom with a motion detector. The control panel is in the bedroom.	I can handle the exterior alarm, but the one in the bedroom is a problem.

1 Oh, man... this is bullshit!    You can't trust anyone these days.	She took everything!    Didn't even leave us cab fare.

1 Today's your lucky day, Sami.	Yeah, I can see that.
2 Normally I'd be breaking your fingers right now, but I'm going to give you a chance to make enough to pay me back and have some extra for yourself. We have a group going to Chicago to do a job. You're going with them.	Me?
3 You lived there. You know the city.	I've still got a few legal problems back in the States.

1 Who is closer to the wall, Joey or me?	Get in the car.
2 Just tell me who's closer to the wall?

1 I'm glad you didn't get something flashy.	Watch this.

1 You put a loaded gun in your bag and brought it through customs? How stupid is that?	Zero did not put it in his bag.    He put it in yours.

1 So, how did you get hooked up with these guys?	Just lucky I guess. How'd you start working for the Bastaldi's?
2 The art world doesn't fully appreciate my talent yet. I needed some way to pay the rent. Laurant and Vincent pay well for information.	So you arranged to have the people you worked for robbed?
3 They're not nice people.

1 She seems pleasant enough.	She doesn't know. She thinks I fell down the stairs.
2 That's good.    That's what a stand-up guy does.

1 Go ahead.	Why should I?  You need practice. I can teach you to fight with the Green Destiny, but first you must learn to hold it in stillness.
2 Why do you want to teach me?	I've always wanted a disciple worthy of Wudan's secrets.
3 And if I use them to kill you?	That's a risk I'm willing to take. Deep down, you're good.  Even Jade Fox couldn't corrupt you.

1 This spells trouble.	I have a guest.

1 You, sister...	Look at the trouble you've caused. Now you know what Giang Hu life is really like.  If you think of me as your sister, let me give you some sisterly advice.  You can run from marriage, but not your parents.
2 They forced me to marry!	Go back to them first.  Then you can decide about Lo.
3 You know about Lo?	He really loves you.  Come back to Peking with me.  We'll find a solution.
4 Where is he now?	Li Mu Bai has made arrangements. He sent him to Wudan Mountain.
5 You're working together to set me up!  I'm leaving!	How dare you accuse us?  I always knew you had stolen the sword! I've done nothing but protect you and your family.  And you're repaid me with nothing but contempt.  Li Mu Bai himself spared you, and all you do is insult him.  We wanted some peace and you've ruined it all! You're no sister of mine!
6 What do I care?  You were never a real friend anyway.  But I wonder, how long could you last as my enemy?

1 Let's stop a moment.	Give it back!
2 You're tired.  You need rest.  Your horse needs water.  There's a creek up here.

1 Do you remember the legend of the young man?	"A faithful heart makes wishes come true."
2 Make a wish, Lo.

1 Don't you want to see her again.	All right.  I'll write you an introduction.  Take it to Wudan. Wait there for news from me.

1 It's Jade Fox!	We must avenge mother!

1 What in the hell... do you call that?	I call it blood, Detective.  If you want, you can call it graffiti.

1 Are you nuts, walking into a gun?	You must listen carefully:  the Fire Department will be here soon. There is an injured man in the alley who needs assistance.  As Shelly Webster once needed your assistance, and as you are shortly going to need my assistance.

1 They couldn't do anything for me.	How 'bout the morgue?
2 No.  I have one more thing to do.

1 I can pick out a tune now and again.	Can you play "Teddy Bears' Picnic?"  It used to be her favorite.
2 Does she have a name?	No name.  You sure ask a lot of questions.

1 I know your friend, too -- the one that looks like a rock star.	I don't know you.
2 I'd like to get in touch with him.

1 Cute nickname, don't you think?	I ain't got no fuckin' ring.
2 Wrong answer.

1 What the hell are you?	Interested?  Follow the crow.

1 Coupla more rings... 24k.	18k.  Crap.
2 ...necklace... pearls...	Nineteen bucks at Sears.  Fake,
3 Leather purse...

1 An unexpected pleasure.	Bad news.  Alot of action on the streets tonight, and nobody bothered to clear it with me.  Tin- Tin got himself whacked.
2 Who got himself what?	One of mine.  And it wasn't a standard hit.
3 I had heard something like this.  Describe it for me.  The "hit".	I was wondering if you could tell me anything... about a wildcat operative.
4 I know of no one.  But even if there is, I am sure it is nothing outside your capacity to deal with?	Anybody violates my turf -- our turf -- I'll rip out there heart and show it to 'em.
5 To be sure.  Now tell how your friend died.

1 You promise not to say anything?	On my mother's life.
2 Okay...

1 Do you deny that there's an attraction between us?	I don't... I don't want to answer that... look we're friends.
2 You don't find me cute? Come on, look at these muscles.

1 What are you reading?	Of Human Bondage.
2 Somerset Maugham.	Yeah, it's pretty relevant considering my situation.
3 You're not gonna start that again.

1 You really want to know?	Yes.
2 It's because I don't trust myself with you.  I took a vow and because of you I'm tempted to break it. Don't destroy that for me. Please.

1 Why are you trying to hurt me?	I'm just being honest. I just wanted to see what you were like in bed.

1 I'm in the bath, mom.	Well hurry up. I want to be at Mrs. Rosemond's before lunch.
2 Okay.

1 Calm down. Tell me what's wrong.	Something awful happened last night.
2 What do you mean?!	I... I don't think you want to know.
3 Cecile, you have to tell me.	It involves your brother. He... took advantage of me.
4 Does your mother know?	If she knew, she'd kill me. It happened at your house last night.
5 Why didn't you do something?	I don't know.
6 So, let me get this straight. You came over to our house late last night and he forced intercourse on you.	Well... not exactly.
7 He made you give him a blow job.	No.
8 Well what then?

1 Okay, okay. I'll just call your mom and have her come pick you up.	My mom? Don't call my mom.
2 Why not? ... Oh wow, she doesn't know you're here. In fact, you're grounded. Jesus, you could get in a shitload of trouble for this. I think I should call her anyway.

1 But you said you have the worst reputation.	I do.
2 Don't you want to change that?	Let me tell you something, doctor. Chicks love a guy with a bad rap. They say they don't, but they don't mean it. They all think that they're the ones that are going to "save me." The trick is to let them think it's true.
3 I think that's all the time we have for today.	Same time next week?
4 No. This is going to be our last session.	Why? I like spending time with you. You know, you're quite attractive for a woman your age. You have killer legs. Killer.
5 This isn't a joke. Your parents spend a lot of money to send you here. I'm trying to help you.	Don't be insecure, Doc. You're a big help.

1 Whoa!	I told you to lock the door.

1 And when I confronted him about his affair with Cecile he told me it was none of my business. Then when I said "Well what about Ronald," he said you were nothing more than a stupid... the n word and that you deserved what you got...	And this happened before you and I hooked up?
2 It's been going on for a while.  Then he called me a disgrace to our family and that's when he hit me.	Racist piece of shit.
3 I'd be careful if I were you. God knows what he's up to.	He doesn't scare me. I'll kick his ass in.
4 Will you stay here for the night? You can leave in the morning. That's when my parents get back and --	Don't worry about it. I'll stay.

1 Oh gee, your journal. Could you be more queer?	Could you be more desperate to read it?

1 Moving along quite well.	Have you succeeded in your task?
2 Any day now.	Well, let me know when you do. Until then.

1 If you're heading towards her room, you won't find her.	Where is she?
2 You don't know?  She left thirty minutes ago.	Where'd she go?
3 She wouldn't say. She apologized to your aunt and told her she was going to stay with some friends.  You blew it, Sebastian. That girl has come to her senses and she will never go near you again.

1 I thought we should celebrate.	I'd love to, but unfortunately I'm expecting some company.
2 Ronald?	Not that it's any of your business but yes.

1 I got your message and came as quick as I could.	I hope I didn't keep you from something.
2 Not at all. What's wrong?	It's Cecile.
3 What about her?	Well... you promise you won't say anything to her. We've developed a friendship and...
4 Kathryn, you have my word. It isn't drugs is it?	It's worse. I think there's something going on between Cecile and her music teacher.
5 Ronald? That's crazy.	I know. She's so young and he's so -
6 Black.

1 Did I ever tell you the time when my late husband sent me -	Yes, you already did.
2 I did?

1 I'm so glad to have met you at last. You're just as nice as Amy told me you were.  I hope you'll come to see us.	I'd love to.

1 But Edward, in this kind of a wish that doesn't matter.	I can make wishes like this come true.  I'll be just like Daddy wants me to be -- play with the other children -- not sit around by myself  tell the truth --

1 Mommy, could Edward take me to Mrs. Farren's house to give her her present?	Wouldn't it be just the same, darling, if daddy dropped the present at Mrs. Farren's on his way to town tomorrow morning?
2 But it won't be Christmas tomorrow.	All right, Amy.  Go tell Edward to take you.

1 What is it, Alice?	I thought Amy was calling. I guess not.

1 I got lots of presents.	And you should.  Your mommy tells me you've been such a good girl, and your daddy is so pleased with you.

1 These are all from me.	This one says, "To Mother from Amy."

1 Who are you?	You called me by my name.
2 Irena. But who are you?	I'm your friend.
3 I've wanted a friend.	I've wanted a friend too. I've been lonely.
4 But where do you come from?	You wouldn't understand. I come from great darkness and deep peace
5 But where is that?	I can not tell you.
6 Will you be friend for always?	For as long as you'll let me.
7 I shall want you for always.	For always, then. Only you must promise never to tell anyone about me
8 Not even Daddy...or Mommy?	No. This must be a friendship that only we shall have... you and I... Amy and her friend.
9 Oh, I like the sound of that.., Amy and her friend... Amy and her friend.

1 It's you...Irena...my friend!	Don't cry, Amy.
2 She's dead! I know what it is now when people say somebody died. I know what they mean! And I'm afraid. She's dead; she's dead!

1 About time for you to come home, Amy.	But Mrs. Farren just started to tell me a story. Please.

1 The Headless Horseman --	Why hasn't he got a head?
2 It was shot off long ago in the great battles that were fought here; with the British on one side and the Americans on the other.

1 You didn't even open my present and I'm your daughter.	My daughter died long ago.

1 ...At the hour of midnight, down the road that goes through Sleepy Hollow, across the bridge, he goes galloping, galloping, always searching, always seeking	Come away, Amy.

1 I didn't even have to coax her tonight.	That's because she made a promise, and she'a keeping it, aren't you, darling.  You saw the way she played this afternoon, Edward.
2 Indeed I did. Up and down the garden she went, laughing and singing to herself.

1 Guess you like those Coyote Ugly steaks now, huh?	Sorry, don't mean to be wolfing down. I'm just starving.
2 Don't apologize. It's great to see a woman really enjoying her food. I hate it when I buy a woman dinner and she won't even touch it.

1 PMS. What symptoms are you experiencing?	It's hard to describe. I get really bloated and irritable and emotional and depressed and...
2 That's just part of being a woman. Diet and exercise should help. Avoid salt, sugar, starches, caffeine, alcohol...	What else is there?
3 And keep a journal of your symptoms to make sure it's related to your period and not just in your head.	It's not just in my head.

1 Okay, just one more stop and you'll be all set. Victoria's Secret.	What do I need overpriced fancy underwear for? Shouldn't a guy have already decided that he likes me before he sees me in lingerie?
2 It's not about him seeing you in it. It's how you feel. You'll feel sexy in lingerie and it'll show. It's an inner thing.	I don't know.
3 There's a sale. It's such a nice place -- classical music, relaxing atmosphere. You deserve to pamper yourself. Come on, it can't hurt.

1 Are those Mark's?	No, Mark wears boxers. They must have been in the dryer already.
2 Uh huh... good thing those cops didn't see that.

1 Bag means condom now? I can't keep up with the word "bag." It used to be "No, that's not my bag" -- meaning not my thing. But now "my bag" means "my fault."	I still thought it was a purse.

1 Hello?	Frida? I was worried to death about you. I've called you for two days. Where have you been?
2 I've been here. What day is it?	Tuesday. Are you okay?
3 Shit, I guess I missed work.	Frida, Carlton's dead.
4 Oh no.	And he was missing an arm.
5 Oh my god Jennifer. I should go to confession.	Relax. Carlton was torn apart. No way could you have done that. Maybe you saw someone kill him and blocked it out... or...

1 I think I just got my period.	Does that mean this whole thing is over?
2 Probably for three weeks or so anyway. I'm not sure -- I don't get how it works.	Let's do some research. I'll check the libraries. You surf the web.
3 You're such a good friend.	So are you. Look, go about your life. Act like nothing's wrong. We'll get to the bottom of this.

1 You hungry?	Starving.

1 Hey wait, I paid three bucks for that burger. You owe me...	You haven't even paid me back the thousand bucks you owe me!
2 I'm working on it...

1 Mr. Grant. Did you read that script I was talking about?	Uh... yes. Not for us. No woman in jeopardy. Find me Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman. Find me a true story about a crazed killer stalking beautiful women.
2 No.	No?
3 No. I quit. Take your lame ass ideas, your fake ass toupee, your fat ass wife and your ugly ass kids and shove them.	Very well then. Is that all?

1 How about you? Briefs or boxers?	Briefs.
2 Cool. I don't get guys who wear boxers. My ex wore boxers. I never got how he could wear khakis and not have his boxers bunch up.	Me neither. That's why I wear briefs... So why did you and... Mark break up?
3 He's bad news. He cheated on me, he insults me. Now suddenly he gets jealous if I have a date.

1 Uh.... hi!	Frida, can we come in? We need to talk to you. It's important.
2 Uh... the buzzer's broken. I'll be down in a second.

1 What's with the squirt guns?	They're for my cat. I use them to train him not to rip up paper.
2 You know, I've never seen your cat.	I loaned him to Jennifer. George moved out and she was lonely...

1 I knew you wouldn't kill me.	Maybe we should have children. I don't think I'd kill the father of my child.
2 We can work this out. Other couples have worse problems.	Worse than this?
3 Sure. Cheating, lying. What's a little werewolf a few days a month? We can move out to the country where you can feed off deer.	What about... those guys... I might have...
4 No way can anything be proved. All they have are some wolf hairs. No one believes in werewolves.	I'm so sorry... I... I couldn't help it. You know I didn't mean to... to do any of that.
5 I know. The important thing is that it stop.

1 We can get a warrant if you like.	No, take it.

1 I'm supposed to put up with a fuckin' cat I'm allergic to cause your friend's got PMS?	It's so bad she becomes a werewolf.
2 You have some weird friends. What does her thinking she's a werewolf have to do with us having the cat?	Don't be stupid George. Obviously if she's a werewolf, she can't be around a cat. She might eat it and besides, cats are afraid of wolves.

1 Frida's sheets checked out fine. It was just her own blood. From her... you know.	I told you she was innocent.
2 Hey, there was a lot of blood.	She was never a suspect Lloyd. Some animal must have done this.
3 I checked all the zoos. No missing animals. You think a pitbull?

1 You think mafia hit?	Hard to tell. Looks like he's been cleaned up and he's decomposing as we speak. This case gets weirder by the minute.
2 It has to be Frida. This makes three guys ripped apart who are tied to her ass.	Okay Lloyd. First, no way does Frida have the physical strength to tear a guy to shreds. Second, why would she be so obvious and let it be known she was the last one to see these guys? Third, she's the one in danger. She's a woman in jeopardy and you're layin' a murder rap on her. Fourth, I look in her eyes and know she's no killer.
3 And fifth, you're dating her.

1 They don't speak English...	How will we interrogate them?
2 Well, sir...  I don't know exactly.

1 Good evening, sir.	Yes.  This way.

1 Im your new assistant.	I didnt requisition a secretary.
2 The Chief-Inspector thought you might need a hand.

1 They didn't have faces.	What?
2 That's right.  Just seamless flesh across the front of their heads.  No mistake.  I just hadn't remembered it that way.  Up until then they had been normal little girls in my memory.  That's not all.  Once I started examining them, all sorts of things about my life, had... inconsistencies.  It was like a game. I would think about a person or a place, or an event.  Then I would turn the lights off.  Sit down in a comfortable chair...  And study each detail of this subject.

1 You see it?	Yes.
2 Where does it lead?	It must be a closet or something.

1 Bad dreams?	Yes.
2 Tell me about them...

1 You're a liar!	No, it's the truth.
2 So you're telling me the truth <u>this</u> time?  Is that it!

1 Uh --Mr. Alexander?	What?
2 Is this dangerous or anything?	No more than the usual.
3 The usual...

1 Dave...	It's in the little leaguer who may strike out but knows in his heart that at least swung...  Hands to the side...

1 You're nothing.  Do you understand me! You're NOBODY...	I'm... not... nobody...
2 You're lint!  You're a flea!  You're a blip!	Well, maybe I am.  But you're fired.

1 A condition...	Exactly. A condition.

1 When does it break?	Couple of days.  Anyhow, look at these tracking polls, they'll burn up in your hands: seventy- three percent with seniors, eighty- four with working mothers...
2 Alan, we still have to control this guy...	And look at this.  Russell came around on the trade bill.
3 You're kidding.	How long have you been waiting to pass that thing?
4 Three years.	I'm telling you, Bob,  it's a gift. When you got a Ferrari you don't leave it in the garage.

1 I'm serious, Dave -- you could get in a lot of trouble for something like this.	It's fine.
2 They could put you in jail.	Why would they do that.  They hired me.

1 Will he be alright?	Oh, yeah... probably...

1 Gimme a quarter.	What?
2 Quick.  Gimme a quarter.

1 What are they?	Fertility beads.
2 Ah.

1 Really?	We'd like to hire you.
2 Really?

1 Well...	Well...

1 ... You know, if you want to be the same old bastard, that's fine.  I can handle it.   But don't pull this 'man of the people' bullshit and then do something like this.	I don't understand.
2 That's not just a works bill you vetoed -- that would have given these kids homes...  ... When I think about that little spectacle you pulled with those muppets and that magic trick...	What's wrong with a magic trick?
3 You made their funding disappear!

1 How were you gonna get home?	I don't know.  I hadn't thought it out that far.

1 So what do you do the rest of the time?	You mean when I'm not running the country?
2 Yes.	I run a temp agency.

1 I saw you on T.V... at his funeral.	Yeah, well... It's finally over.

1 Please....shoot me.	And if I don't? If I don't you'll come back after your death. You'll come back and find yourself hanging there...wanting to eat...needing to eat human flesh. You hate that thought, don't you? That's the ultimate sin for most of you fools, isn't it?

1 I know it hurts. But it won't be long. Then all the pain will be over. Oh, I wish you could hear me. GOD, GIVE HER THE EARS TO HEAR ME SO SHE KNOWS I DON'T WANT HER TO HURT SO!	Quiet!
2 Oh, yes. Quiet. Yes. We must be quiet.

1 I can find it myself. I didn't come that far.	Farther than you think. You'll get lost. You will. And there's Bees all through the jungle. I ain't lyin' to ya. Religiosos don't lie.
2 No. They just try to hold you for ransom. Fuck you, Moses! I'm outa here!

1 There ya go. Complete with air canisters...little motors.	We got a boat.
2 What?	I say we got a boat. Can you get other stuff?
3 I got some fuel comin' out and, I hope, some automatic rifles.

1 Aaaaaaah...my God...my God...I am heartily sorry...for having offended Thee....offended Thee...	Shhhhh....Tony. Rest, rest.
2 I detest all my sins...because... because of Thy just punishment... because of Thy...just...punish...

1 Mary.	I'll have somebody's ass for this. I'll have your ass, soldier. I'm not gonna stand here and...
2 MARY!

1 Sounds boring to me.	Don't come.
2 You know how many demerits we're talking?	So don't goddam come!  Please.
3 All I'm saying is we have to be careful. We can't get caught.	Well, no shit, Sherlock

1 God, I can't take it anymore!  If I don't have Chris, I'll kill myself.	Knox, you gotta calm down.
2 No, I've been calm all my life!  If I don't do something, it's gonna kill me.

1 I hereby declare this the Charles Dalton Cave for Passionate Experimentation.  In the future, anyone wishing entry must have permission from me.	Wait a minute, Charlie. This should belong to the club.
2 It should, but I found it and now I claim it.  carpe cavern, guys.  Seize the cave.

1 Yeah!    Don't you guys miss having girls here?	Miss it?  It drives us crazy.  That's part of what this club is about.  In fact, I'd like to announce that I've published an article in the school paper, in the name of the Dead Poets society, demanding girls be admitted to Welton, so we can all stop beating off.

1 Do you still insist that this was your idea and your idea alone?	Yes... sir.
2 What is this "Dead Potts Society"?  I want names.	It's only me, Mr. Nolan.  I swear. I made it up.
3 If I find that there are others, Mr. Dalton, they will be expelled and you will remain enrolled.  Stand up.

1 Where'd you find them?	They were walking along the fence past the soccer field.  Said they were curious about the school so I invited them to the meeting.

1 Don't stop.	Stop what?
2 Chet...

1 Chris!	Knox!  what are you doing here?

1 The hoi polloi.  Doesn't it mean the herd?	Precisely, Meeks. Greek for the herd. However, be warned that, when you say "the hoi polloi" you are actually saying the the herd.  Indicating that you too are "hoi polloi."

1 Mr. Keating? Sir? Oh Captain My Captain.  What was the Dead Poets Society?	Ah, so you boy's have been snooping.
2 I was just looking in an old annual and...	Nothing wrong with research.

1 Wait a minute.  I don't let my parents walk on me.	Yeah, you just do everything they say! You'll be in daddy's law firm as sure as I'm standing here.  And you'll be approving loans till you croak.

1 I gotta get to the tryouts.  Wish me luck.	Good luck.

1 I hear we're going to be roommates. Neil Perry.	Todd Anderson.

1 None of what Mr. Keating has to say means shit to you, does it?	What is that supposed to mean?
2 Being in the club means being stirred up by things.  You look about as stirred up as a cesspool.	You want me out...  is that what you're saying?
3 No, I want you in.  But being in means you gotta do something.  Not just say you're in.	Listen Neil, I appreciate your interest in me but I'm not like you.  When you say things, people pay attention.  People follow you.  I'm not like that.
4 Why not?  Don't you think you could be?	No!  I don't know,  I'll probably never know.  The point is, there's nothing you can do about it so butt out, all right? I can take care of myself just fine.  All right?
5 Er  No.	No?  What do you mean 'no'?
6 No.

1 Who are you?	He's the owner...
2 Why don't you want a message sent?

1 Right here...middle of nowhere...and the answer to your question is yes.	Which question is that?
2 The one you came up to ask...are we on schedule?	Take note Mr. Mason...this is why you hire a professional...No whining. No excuses.

1 Shut up! Shut up all of you! Now here's what we're doing... Mamooli is going to take you back to fix your engines, Chin and I are staying here to finish the job...	Did you clear this?
2 With who?

1 But what makes you think there aren't more of those...things...back there?	Nothing...you want to come, come... you don't...

1 I was so goddamn close, Finnegan! So goddamn close to my island... I could almost taste the sand...	Keep tasting...

1 Let's just keep going.	You ain't giving the orders here!

1 You know what I'm gonna do after this...I'm gonna get a normal life...	Joey...
2 ...Like a house in the suburbs... maybe a couple of kids...some sort of business...be in the bowling league...go to the ball games...

1 I'm telling you, man, we got to give the future some serious thought.	I have been.
2 And what have you come up with?	How does an island sound to you?

1 I thought the plan was we'd evacuate them after we got through.	Maybe plans changed...
2 Plans don't change...

1 She fucked us both.	Yeah.
2 Fucking women, man...	I know...

1 And we want you to know, Sal, that any help you might need--	Yeah, Sal--

1 Hey, Nick, I mean... This here is for the guy that gets caught!	Vince thinks... you know...

1 He's real bad, Nick.	Well, where the hell is he!!! I mean what are we all sitting here for!!!  WHAT THE HELL IS THIS???
2 Nick...

1 She's in back.	Thanks.
2 How was huntin'?	Oh. Fine.
3 Get anything?	No.
4 Too bad.

1 Where's it gone?	Inside, Vince.

1 Sit with Linda, man, will ya?... Give her a beer.  Would you like a beer?	Sure.
2 What kind of beer would you like?	I don't know.
3 Give her Miller's. Miller's High Life.

1 Linda... Honey, what's wrong?	I don't know.
2 Hey. Look. There must be something.

1 Won't we? Right? Am I right?	Right.

1 Hey, Nick?	Huh?
2 Tomorrow I go with Vince.	Hunt with Vince?
3 Yeah... I mean so he knows... He doesn't even know.

1 Where's Vince?	There's Albert!  Hey, Albert!!!

1 Oh cards, maybe. Poker... It's getting cold, Sal. I'm going to take you in.  We'll call Angela. The guys can help her bring you home... Did I tell you I was going on a trip?	Trip? What do you mean, Nick? You said you'd be --
2 It's okay. Hey, it's okay! Just a week. Just to see Phantom Mary.	Phantom Mary?
3 Didn't I ever tell you about Phantom Mary?	No.
4 Well... Phantom Mary's on my mother's side. Naturally no one there admits it because Phantom Mary's pretty weird... You want to hear the whole story?	Yeah!
5 Like I say, Phantom Mary's pretty weird... Lives alone, lives way out in the middle of nowhere with a cat called Pajamas and a cow called Fred. Well, last week I got a call from Phantom Mary, which in itself was very strange...

1 Quiet!... Quiet!!!... Awright, everybody, Nick has a few words.	I just... would like to say a few words... about Merle. I guess Merle always wanted something... I don't know... better. That fucking guy, he saved my Life. He saved Sal's... What Merle liked, he liked things right... But then there wasn't any place for that... that he could find.

1 Who is it?	Avon Lady!

1 What's this?	Fill it out.  Standard issue mal- practice insurance.  All Cops carry it.

1 This is a war, Wade.  You against him.  Vengeance time.  The City's just in the way.  Kill the fucker. You and me.  We'll work things out when the time is right.	Remember my promise.
2 Don't threaten me.  I tend to take these things seriously.  And get a couple hours sleep.  You look like day old shit.	Got compliments coming outta your ass, don't ya?

1 You two fucks listen up.  Doucet's killing people and you're wasting valuable time busting two-bit Technothugs.	But sir, Sergeant Wade saved the hostages.
2 I'm thrilled beyond belief.

1 Need help?	I got it.  I got it.
2 You sure?  I can help you.	Ah Mom, you're embarrass'n me.
3 Nobody's looking.	Go in the house.

1 You can't turn him off.  He's the Commissioner.	I'm not fond of television comedies.

1 Married?	Engaged.  Plan on doing it this summer.  You still married?
2 Yeah.  Least I think so.  Twenty- six years this March.

1 Wanna try?	No thank you, sir.  Smoking causes lung cancer, heart disease, emphysema, and may complicate pregnancy.
2 You're not pregnant, are you?	No, sir.

1 I just heard.	He's got my grandson, Sanchez.
2 You be careful.	I'm signing off.

1 Hi.	Hi.
2 Haven't seen you around.  Where have you been all my life, handsome?

1 What are those people doing there? What do they want?	They're just outsiders. They want to see how fine Jabez Stone lives these days. They're waiting for your guests, too --

1 Yes, you did, Daniel! I saw it from the window. And then to lie about it! Give me that beanshooter, Daniel!	It's mine, Ma! Pa made it for me -- and I'm not going to give it to anyone!
2 Daniel give me that beanshooter!	No! No! I won't.
3 Daniel! ...  I've stood just about as much as I can bear!

1 I am just thinkin' -- now they mightn't like the idea down in Washington.	Why not! There's a bill up in Congress to give us a uniform law of bankruptcy. Daniel Webster is fighting for it right now--
2 Black Dan'l?

1 What's the matter with you?	You are afraid!
2 Afraid ... of what?	-- of what happens after we die!
3 Are you plumb crazy, man! What do you think happens? We're buried -- that's all.	But what becomes of our souls?
4 Why do you fret about something that isn't there?	Don't say that -- I know it is --
5 All right -- so it's buried with you!	What if one hasn't a soul any more? What of that?
6 Huh? -- What's that?  Well -- what about it? Who cares, anyhow?	I do -- and I think you should too.
7 Stevens -- what's all this leading up to? You know something. Come on! Out with it -- you know something about me!

1 Trying to break our contract again, Mr. Stone?	I'm through with you.
2 What a headstrong fellow! Well -- I guess you're quite prepared to suffer the consequences.	I have still a year -- a year to make up for everything.
3 Oh no, you violated clause five of our contract and I could collect right now, if I chose.	Not now! Not now!  -- Let me make up -- let me make up.
4 Suddenly you seem quite desperate, Mr. Stone --  -- You know I'm a good-natured man. I'm always open to reason. With a little security -- I might--	Anything -- anything. -- You can have it all back -- that money -- the new house -- my farm -- the whole caboodle!
5 I'm afraid that's hardly the sort of security I was thinking of --  You see -- there is that promising little fellow, your son ...	No! No! No! Not him -- not my son -- I'd rather go with you -- right now.
6 Come, come, Mr. Stone, you are a little upset. It's not fair to bargain with you now. -- I'll give you until midnight, Mr. Stone, but not one minute more. Ah, then you'll come with me indeed.

1 I'm sorry you can't see that, I know you could once -- you made a little speech once, that I'll always remember and I know the others do too --  They remember and they see how you have changed. That's why they didn't want to come tonight to you, Jabez -- you're as blind as a Burma bat, with your gold pot! Mind you, it's not the money, I've been talking about, it's what you make of it.	I -- I don't know what you're talking about! I -- I haven't time to listen to all this --
2 No -- you haven't time -- You haven't time for your mother, or your wife, or your child.	It's your fault! You brought Daniel Webster here -- just to try to make a fool of me! You played the sneak behind my back -- made up all sorts of lies against me! You can get yourself out of my home -- go back to the other house -- that old place, where you belong -- I don't want to -- to talk to you again!

1 Oh!	Headache -- Squire?
2 Worst I had in years -- ahem -- starting a spring cold, I guess -- er -- don't happen to have a bit of camomile tea in the house, do you, Stone?	Camomile tea!

1 I remember Dad used to say sometimes, when they were handing out hard luck, the farmers got there first.	Jabez, don't you remember your own wedding? We said it's for better or worse. We said it's for richer or poorer.
2 That's what we said.

1 What do you think of that, Jabez?	Looks right elegant, Mary.

1 Ruined -- all the fields -- ruined. 	Mary -- but look -- it didn't touch an ear of my corn -- we'll have a rich harvest.

1 Jabez -- Jabez!	Mary!

1 Queer sort of weather we're having -- queer like everything else.	Well, thank the Lord you can always depend on New England for weather. We've got enough for the whole United States.
2 I feel -- fidgety, Ma -- not right at all.	Lan's, I'd think you was having the baby, to hear you.
3 Me -- a son.

1 Hello, Sheriff.	Hello, Jabez -- I was just talking to Stevens about a little extension on your payment.
2 And you didn't get it, hey? Come on, we'll have another talk with him.

1 Mary! Ready? First bell's a-ringing!	Yes, Ma -- I'm ready --

1 There is nothing like a good old country breakfast. Where's Ma?	She'll be here in a moment. She has a special surprise for you.

1 I'm John McClane.	Argyle.  I'm your limo driver.  Hey, nice bag.

1 One of yours?	No, sir.
2 If he's not a terrorist, and he's not a hostage...he's just not part of the equation.

1 Nothing...	See to Heinrich...  Now...you can break the code key...?

1 I don't know it!  get on a Goddamn jet to Tokyo and ask the chairman! I'm telling you!  You're just going to have to kill me --	Okay.

1 Nein, dies ein ist mein.  This time John Wayne does not walk off into the sunset with Grace Kelly.	That was Gary Cooper, shithead...
2 No more jokes, drop it or she gets it between the eyes!	Whoa, Hans, now you're the cowboy?
3 'Yippe-ki-yea, mother fucker'?  Now you are fucked.

1 Mr. Takagi chose his people well, Mrs...?	Gennero.  Miss Gennero.

1 Relax, Ellis.  I'm off duty.	Can I get you anything?  Food?  Cake? Watered down champagne punch?
2 I'm fine.  You throw quite a party.  I didn't know they had Christmas in Japan.	Hey, we're flexible.  Pearl Harbor didn't work out, we got you with tape decks.

1 Al?  Al, you there?	I'm here, cowboy.
2 Speaking of cows, did you ever hear so much bullshit in your life? Two hours?  That doesn't even make any sense --	Don't tell me, partner.  I'm just a desk jockey who was on the way home when you rang.
3 The way you drove that car, I figured you for the streets.	In my youth, partner.  In my youth.

1 Is that him?	Yessir.
2 Give me that.  Now, listen to me, mister, I don't know what you think you're doing, but demolishing a building doesn't fall under the definition of 'help'! There's hundreds of people out here and you covered half of them in pieces of glass --

1 You'll be okay.	You men shoot, aim for the white meat!

1 No.  Look, we're kind of....	That's why I can talk to you, as an equal, Sonny.  You got to merge your whole soul with God.  And then you are Him and one with the Holy Ghost.
2 Yeah, well...maybe you better talk to one of these others, okay?	Sonny?  Don't send me away!  I can help you save your soul ...

1 What?	When I'm bein' fucked, I like to be kissed a lot.  Who the fuck are you tryin' to con me into some deal?  You're a city cop, where's the FBI?  This is a federal offense, I got kidnapping, armed robbery, they're gonna bury me!  You know it, you can't talk for them, you're some flunky pig tryin' to bullshit me.  Now God damn it, get somebody in charge here to talk to me!
2 Calm down, you're not ...	Calm down... look at this, look at him...!

1 Okay, okay... we know it's a stickup!	If he moves - blow his guts out... Cover him!

1 For God's sake, will you please go now?  We gave you every nickel we got.	You're goin' outside with me.  If there's no cops around, we just split.  Otherwise, you go with us.

1 Why the hell did he do that?  What the hell did I do?	I guess he didn't appreciate your use of language.  They don't speak that way on television.  It's a rule.  Do you realize you've cut off a valuable source of communication?

1 You got Bank Americard?	What now, Sonny?
2 Listen, I owe a couple hundred dollars!  I don't wanta leave owing anybody anything!  A clean slate, a new leaf...

1 You don't smoke ... why do you want to start now.	Because I'm scared, that's why. You never smoked?
2 I used to, but I stopped.	You stopped?  Why?
3 Because I don't want cancer.	You don't want cancer?  You're about to get your head blown off, you're worried about cancer.  Gimme the cigarette.

1 He wants one.	Dead or alive?
2 Alive.

1 What'd he say?	He was talkin' about arrangements ... we were talkin' about the TV.
2 Why couldn't he talk about that here?	He was showin' me how the airport bus is comin' in, like that, Sal.  What's wrong with him?

1 Wait a minute!  What the fuck you tryin' to tell me?	What I said.  You just sit quiet and we'll handle Sal.

1 Listen, I'll never make it.  I'll have to go to the toilet.	What's the matter... they never housebroke you?
2 It's not a joke.  I got this terrible fear of being locked in...

1 Mom - they're sending a bus to take us to the airport.  You understand? If you're here - they're not gonna send it.  They'll think I'm gonna come out with you.	What's wrong with that?  The FBI was very understanding when I explained it to him.  Everybody knows it isn't you ... It's the pressures from your home life.
2 For God's sake don't start in on Heidi again ...	Did I say a thing against her?  God forbid I should say anything against that fat cunt.
3 Mom.  Mom.  There are some things a mother shouldn't say in front of her son.	If she comes down here, so help me I'm gonna mash her brains in. Everything in your life was sunlight and roses until you met her.  Since then, forget it.
4 She doesn't have anything to do with it!  You understand that? Mother?  This is me!	I know you wouldn't need Leon if Heidi was treating you right.  The thing I don't understand is why you come out and sleep with Heidi anyway?  You got two kids on welfare now.  What're you goin' to bed with her, you don't have enough with one wife and two kids on welfare, you want a wife and three kids on welfare?
5 Not now, Mom, please.	What'll you do?  Come out.
6 I can't, Mom.  If I come out Sal will kill them.	Oh.  Run.
7 What the hell for?  Twenty-five years in the pen?	Maybe...
8 Maybe!  Aw Christ, what dreams you live on!  Maybe what?

1 <i>They can do subtitles.</i>	<i>Choco grew up on the streets of El Salvador. When he was four years old... he stabbed another kid in the eye-ball with a pencil.</i>  <i>There were wires crossed somewhere in his soul.</i>

1 So what?	You know what I'm talking about, did you fuck her?

1 She's right... you lost your temper... and you started cursing like some ghetto skank. You lost all credibility right there!	That bitch called me a bitch.

1 Is it true that you were hired to track down and capture the thieves... and then deliver them to Drake Bishop... owner of the Stratosphere Hotel & Casino?	Yes.
2 You then learned where the thieves had hidden the money... and at the instructions of your employer went to retrieve it yourself.	He sent us out to the Fender Compound. Out in the desert near the Chicken Ranch.

1 HE'S STILL ALIVE, EDNA!	PROVE IT!

1 <i>My real father was an actor. He died when I was a little girl.</i>	Wow. Laurence Harvey. He knew Frank Sinatra?  I knew Frank.

1 Can you tell?	You're wearing eyeliner. You look like a queen.

1 They need to get the introduction on camera. Just play along, alright?	They're gonna edit it together out of sequence so it's more exciting. <b> EXT. BEVERLY HILLS -- LATER ON

1 Ain't nobody gonna call me a bitch without some payback.	Nobody.

1 I'm gonna leave now.	If I wasn't a righteous Black man you'd be in serious trouble. SERIOUS.

1 Mookie.	What?
2 How come you ain't got no brothers up?	Ask Sal.
3 Sal, how come you ain't got no brothers up on the wall here?

1 What can you say?	I don't know how he does it.

1 Eddie Lovell.	How old are you?
2 Ten.	What makes Sammy run?
3 My name is Eddie.	What makes Sammy run?
4 I said my name is Eddie Lovell.	Relax, Eddie, I want you to go to the corner store.  How much will it cost me?
5 How would I know how much it's gonna cost if I don't know what I'm buying?	Eddie, you're too smart for your own britches.  Listen to me.  How much do you want to run to the store for Da Mayor?
6 Fifty cents.	You got a deal.

1 Jade, you're late.	I know, Mother Sister, but I'm here now.  Where's the stuff?

1 Fool, you're thirty cents away from a quarter.  How you gonna get a boat?	Don't worry about it.
2 You're raggedy as a roach.  You eat the holes out of donuts.	I'll be back on my feet.  Soon enough.
3 So when is all this ice suppose to melt?

1 Korea man is OK.  Let's leave him alone.	Him no white.  Him no white.

1 Whatdafuck do you want?	I wants my money.  I wants to get paid.

1 I'm gonna take off ya clothes.	Mookie, I told you already it's too fucking hot to make love.
2 Why you gotta curse?	I'm sorry, but no rawness is jumping off tonight.
3 No rawness.

1 Pop, I don't believe this shit.  We runnin' welfare or somethin'? Every day you give dat bum--	Da Mayor ain't no bum.
2 Give dat bum a dollar for sweeping our sidewalk.  What do we pay Mookie for?  He don't even work.  I work harder than him and I'm your own son.	Who don't work?  Let's see you carry six large pies up six flights of stairs.  No elevator either and shit.

1 I'll do that.	We're outta here.

1 Some are OK.	My friends laugh at me all the time, laugh right in my face, tell me go feed the Moulies.

1 Turn it off.	Mister Radio Raheem, I can't even hear myself think.  You are disturbing me and you are disturbing my customers.

1 Take it easy, Pop.	Don't start on me today.

1 CHING CHONG, What happened to your beautiful Asian accent?	Actually, my name is Cindy, the accent just helps me meet boys.

1 HARRY? Are you okay?	Are you kidding? I couldn't be more okay.
2 My mom wants to know if you can stay for dinner.	Are you kidding? I'll be down in a "I-crapped-my-pants."
3 What?	Coming.

1 You're going to be just fine, HARRY.	I know I am, Mom.
2 Here's your lunch. And an apple and banana for extra energy.	Maybe the treasure's a chest full of apples and bananas!

1 Who's Principal Collins?	The principal.
2 Wow.

1 Whoa. What was that?	What?
2 Your mom made a move on me.	She did not.
3 Who knows? Maybe someday I'll be your new daddy.	LLOYD, she's my mom.
4 I can't help my heart. And when I'm your dad, you'll have to do as I say.	Will not.
5 Don't use that tone with me, young man.	Shut up!
6 I will stop this car right now.	You're not my real dad.
7 You take that back!	Shut Up! Buttlick!
8 Where did you learn that word?	I learned it from listening to you! I hate you!
9 Kids.

1 These are really cold, huh?	That's why you have to drink it fast, trust me.

1 Uh oh. Captain Rob's always been my partner.	Sucks for you.
2 Who's your partner?	I don't know. I haven't decided yet.
3 Well... Uh...maybe... jeez, how can I say this... you and I could...perhaps ...maybe...uh... partner up?	You and me? Dream on, desperado.
4 Oh. Sorry. You're right, field trip partner is a big commitment.	I'm kidding! Of course I'll be your partner.

1 Now what are you staring at, you ugly monkey?	What are you staring at, you ugly monkey?

1 If you have to ask, you don't know.	Yeah, that's why I asked.
2 You certainly did.	I know I did.
3 Sorry, no further questions.

1 Enough! Look what this cursed chest is doing to us.	I don't know who we are anymore.

1 Guys, this is much better.	PRINCIPAL COLLINS is a greater American than George Washington will ever be.

1 You take her.	No Lloyd. Chicks are for fags - I'm not going to do it.

1 Well, what have we here? It appears be a tape.	That's not your tape.
2 Then where did you get this not my tape.	THAT'S NOT YOUR TAPE.
3 Don't play with me dear, you're way out of your league.

1 Where'd that come from? He holds up a giant key chain.	Come on, I live with the janitor. I have a key to every room in the school.
2 So could you get us into the principal's office?	Principal's office? Yeah, I guess I can swing that.

1 He's going to be in jail for a long time.	Principal of jail. Wow. What a promotion.

1 How was that?	It's too close to call.  Okay next contest, now lets...

1 That's great, now make a left, then straight!	Oh, yeah he was straight all right, just wasn't very good in the sack. I used to give him directions. Higher, lower, faster, harder, small circles, do the alphabet. Useless.

1 It's the big potato.	Yes, it's the big potato. Just have a look at this.

1 Where is it?	I don't know where it is. It's not here. It's been stolen.
2 Wait a minute, I think I know who stole it.	No you don't know who stole it. Just let me do the thinking.

1 My thanks.	With your permission...

1 So, this is Leto the Just...	I hope I made myself clear. You may call him "The Duke," "My lord," or "Sire." And there is a more ancient term you might keep in mind -- "Noble Born."
2 Play out your little comedy while you can off-worlders...

1 This is a Harkonnen animal.  Let me, please, my Lord.	The Emperor's blade.

1 I can't maintain any altitude... we'll never reach the safety of rock.  Maybe that small rock.	Where are we do you think?
2 The South Polar regions... the forbidden area.  We must make it to that rock...

1 Are you a Fremen?	I am a servant of the His Majesty the Emperor. I have served His Majesty on Arrakis long enough for my eyes to change.
2 He's hiding something.

1 Long live the fighters!	Long live the fighters!

1 You mustn't speak of...	SILENCE!

1 So <u>you</u> sleep in coffins?!	Yes.  There is nothing more comfortable.
2 I can't believe this!  <u>I</u> sleep in coffins!	No.
3 YES!  My father ran a mortuary -- it's an old habit!

1 Shh!  I'm coming!  I will feed you!	Well... I guess I should go.  Perhaps we could get together again?
2 Certainly.  But now the children of the night are calling me.

1 Look, you seem a little agitated. Do you maybe wanna take a little break, go for a nice walk... and then we'll come back and shoot the scene?	BULLSHIT!  I am ready now!  Roll the camera!!

1 No Bela, that's "incorporates."  Look, just say "This casket has..."	Ach!  How do they expect a Hungarian to pronounce this dialogue?  This live television is madness!

1 Eddie, I'm so tired... I don't know if I can handle a night shoot...	Nonsense!  You look great --  Look, uh, why don't you lie down and take a little nap?  We'll film around you for a while.

1 Buddy, I don't know if that's such a good idea.	It'll be wonderful.  We'll be at peace.  In the afterlife, you don't have to worry about finding work.
2 Bela, I'm on your side.  C'mon, give me the gun...  If you give me the gun, I'll make you a drink.  What are you drinking?	Formaldehyde.

1 Eddie, I want to thank you.  These last few days have been a good time.	I just wish you coulda seen the movie.
2 No problem.  I know it by heart...

1 I got the early edition!  It was just dropped off at the newsstand.	This is the big moment...!

1 Edward, are you sure you know what you're doing?	Yeah.  It seems a little crazy, but sometimes <u>you just know</u>.  She's perfect for me.

1 And what about this so-called "Barbara" character?  It's obviously ME!  I'm so embarrassed!  This is <u>our</u> <u>life</u>!	Of course it is.  And that's why you should play the part.
2 Oh!  You got nerve, buddy.

1 Goddamn landlord.	I told you this was gonna happen.
2 Maybe if you'd come to the backers party, I would've gotten the money.	That's moronic.  Why would a bit player impress a backer?
3 Look, how many times can I say I'm sorry?  I blew it!  I thought she was rich.	That's a good reason to dump your girlfriend.
4 <u>I didn't dump you</u>!  Get it through your skull -- I just recast the part!

1 Eddie, which dress do you like better?	I don't know.  Hey Bill, which dress is better for you, the green or the red one?

1 Mr. Wood?!	Hruphh...?
2 Mr. Wood, this is Mr. Reynolds, your landlord.  Could you please open up?

1 Glad you could fit me in your schedule.	Da pleasure be mine.

1 Tor, I should be getting home.	Nonsense!  You must try our hot glug.

1 Well, Mr. Weiss, I've never told anyone what I'm about to tell you... but I really want this job.  I like to dress in women's clothing.	Are you a fruit?
2 No, no, not at all!  I <u>love</u> women. Wearing their clothes makes me feel closer to them.	So you're not a fruit?
3 Nah, I'm all man.  I even fought in WW2.  'Course, I <u>was</u> wearing ladies' undergarments under my uniform.	You gotta be kiddin' me.
4 Confidentially, I even paratrooped wearing a brassiere and panties. I'll tell ya, I wasn't scared of being killed, but I was <u>terrified</u> of getting wounded, and having the medics discover my secret.

1 But I'm proud.  I wrote, directed, and starred in it just like Orson Welles in "Citizen Kane"!	Yeah??  Well Orson Welles didn't wear angora sweaters, did he??!

1 You're not gonna believe the first picture I ever saw.  Your friend's.	What do you mean?
2 "Dracula."

1 You should feel lucky.  Ed's the only guy in town who doesn't pass judgment on people.	Hell, if I did, I wouldn't have any friends.

1 <u>It's uncanny</u>.	What's uncanny?
2 LOOK AT HIS SKULL!

1 Ed, I got the Lugosi lookalikes outside.	Great!  Bring 'em in!  Bunny, I gotta run.

1 Eddie, I'm just a small-town girl. I've never done this before.	Don't worry, I'll teach you.

1 Whatever happened to Norman Rockwell?	Who?
2 Norman Rockwell. He painted magazine covers. Folksy. A mailman, a boy scout, a kid visiting a doctor...	Yeah, so... ?
3 They celebrated the common person.	Well, I don't think you can get more common than me, Al.
4 No. Only celebrities now. Now, if you put a mailman on the cover of a magazine he'd better have killed someone or no one will buy it. This one to Dr. Rumpley.

1 What did you study?	Oh, see, studying would've been a huge help. Where were you, then?

1 I don't think so.	Yeah. Because, you didn't talk me into anything. Everything you wanted me to do, I wanted to do.

1 Oh, that thing. Yeah. Did you hear about this?	Yeah, what - they put some schmuck on TV all day long or something?

1 Yes.	Yes to me or yes to the coil?
2 Both.	Holy sh--

1 What's going on over there?	Everybody's making audition tapes for that Real TV thing.

1 Are you asking me?	No, I mean...

1 I mean bad.	Look, not having been there... I just think you're hurt and you're saying this to, you know, get back at him.

1 I told you. If we... you know do it, they go away until ... we're done.	I know, but even if they go away, everybody in America knows what we're doing because... they went away.
2 So? What do they think -- we're not kids --	I know, I ...
3 Shari, I really like you...	I really like you too...
4 ...if this ...  ... weren't here... ?	... yeah, then, but...
5 So...?	Ed... I think we should stop seeing each other.

1 Kinda'.	It's what I do. I yell "Geronimo" and jump out of a relationship.

1 You're gonna be a video store clerk for the rest of your life? This is your big ambition, rearranging the "Ernest" movies?	Screw off.
2 How many opportunities are you going to get in your life?	I don't know.
3 That's right. You don't know. Doors don't fly open for guys like us.	Hey. You know-- we're not the same. I got a good life, this job suits me. I come and go when I please --
4 Oh, don't bullshit a bullshitter. If you're happy like this you're an idiot, and you're not an idiot.  Hi.

1 Hi.	You watching the ballgame?
2 Uh, no, uh I'm a little tired. I fell asleep.	Oh. All right. I'11 watch at home, then.
3 Yeah...

1 And each contestant gets one of these.  An "I tried to screw a network executive" tee-shirt.	A hundred per cent cotton. Okay, here we go, Andy.

1 That girl's an idiot.	What?... Why?

1 Look, can we all just sign the releases so we can get on with this?	What happened? You described this "crazy-kooky" family who'd be a million laughs on TV?

1 One night he took us editors out to celebrate after a deadline. Eventually Dave and I were left alone and we got to talking - not like teacher and student, but like two adults.	You know, Tracy... I don't know how to say this, but...

1 Having a problem with your eye there?	Dick.

1 Well, good luck there, Tracy	Thanks, Mr. M.

1 These are a bunch of burn-outs. And look at this one, I can't even read this one.	Looks like Tim Kobza.

1 So what brings you here?	I'm looking at new cars.
2 Oh.  New cars.  I see.  Well, you came to the right place	My mother's buying me a new car for college.
3 Huh.  Right.  College.  Wow.  Where are you going?  Where 'd you get into?	Well, I got in everywhere I applied, but Cornell is my first choice.
4 Good for you.  Good for you

1 I'm scared, Mr. M. I kind of don't feel ready for college.	You'll be fine.
2 I hope so	You will.

1 Without Dave around. Sherry needed a lot of help around the house.	Here?
2 More this way.	Okay.  Give me the drill.

1 Oh, no.  No.  I'm just finishing up here, and I've got to get home.	Why don't you guys go sit down, okay? I'll catch up in a minute? I want to talk to Mr. M. about some important stuff.

1 We can't both run, can we?  We're brother and sister.  Can we?	It's a conflict of interest.  And Paul was first.

1 Hey, Tammy, guess what happened today.	Don't you fucking knock?
2 Yeah.  So guess what happened.  So Mr. McAllister, he --  Oh hi. Lisa.	Paul, get out!
3 So Mr. M. calls me in and tells me --

1 I was friendly with Sue Lefferts, but we weren't really friends. You know what I mean?	Are you sorry she's dead?
2 Of course I am.  What kind of question is that?

1 Come in out of the rain, Bud.	You gonna tell me what happened with you and Exley?
2 We talked.	So tell me about it.
3 In the morning.	No.  Now.  You fucked him.

1 Hey, partner.  Grab a cup.	I got to write my report first.

1 Yeah, that's Stens.	Hell of a way to avoid a prison sentence.

1 It's a suicide note.  Says he killed Jack because Jack had figured out a pornography scam Patchett was running.	He had help getting up there.  Two of his fingers are broken.
2 We had one thing figured wrong.  I don't think Dudley workd for Patchett.	At least not anymore.
3 Patchett's dead.  He sent you after me.  I'd say Dudley's tying up his loose ends.	<u>Lynn</u>.

1 Thanks, but no thanks.	Against your code?
2 I don't have one.  Lefferts looked beat-up Christmas Eve, but didn't act it.  How come?	Do you care about criminal matters peripheral to Susan's murder?
3 No.	Then you wouldn't feel obligated to report them?
4 That's right.	Then listen closely, because I'll only say this once and if it gets repeated, I'll deny it.  I run call girls.  Lynn Bracken is one of them and so was Susan Lefferts. I treat my girls very well.  I have grown daughters, myself, and I don't like the thought of women being hurt.  I sense you share this feeling.
5 Why were Lefferts' eyes black?	I think she'd been hit in the face with a tennis racket.  She is -- was -- a big doubles fan.
6 You wanna go downtown and discuss this officially?	Wait.  Our deal still holds?

1 Cotton balls.  I found them just inside the meat locker door.	<u>Ear plugs</u>.
2 Exactly.  At least one of those animals had the brains to protect his ears.	It doesn't exactly play like dumb panic.
3 What do you mean?	It's like they knew they were going to kill everyone before they went in...
4 Yeah, so...

1 Ray, you protected Ty and Larry up in Casitas, didn't you?	You ain't woofin' I did.  Stupid down home niggers got no more sense than a fuckin' dog.

1 You're wrong.	Am I...?  Would you be willing to plant corroborative evidence on a suspect you knew was guilty in order to ensure an indictment?
2 Dudley, we've been over this.	Answer yes or no.
3 I... No.	Would you be willing to rig crime scene evidence to support a prosecuting attorney's working hypothesis...?  Yes or no, Edmund.
4 No.	Would you be willing to beat confessions out of suspects you knew to be guilty?
5 No.	Would you be willing to shoot hardened criminals in the back to offset the chance --
6 No.	Then for God's sake, don't be a detective.  Stick to assignments where you won't have to make those choices.  Patrol, Internal Affairs, but not the Bureau.
7 I know you mean well, Dudley, but I don't need to do it the way you did.  Or my father.	At least get rid of the glasses. I can't think of one Bureau man who wears them.

1 I'm loathe to kill my brother officers, Edmund.	Tell that to Jack Vincennes.  To Stensland.
2 Jack was a shame, but Dick Stensland had the audacity to try to sell me my own heroin.  Through his whore girl friend.  I sent him to make the buy.  The rest is history.	Why?
3 A vacuum, Edmund.  That's what we have in Los Angeles.  Sending Mickey Cohen up created it.  My containment work maintained it. Certain photographs guarantee it. Organized crime has been held back, but there's still a demand for the services it provides.	And now you'll provide them.
4 Absolutely.  Prostitution and gambling are victimless crimes. The heroin we'll run down to the coloreds.  Anesthetize them.  As long as it's not a middle class problem, no one will care.  It's still a crime free city... for respectable people.

1 I need to speak to you.	Give me a minute, will ya?

1 What's on the call sheet?	A guy dressed as Santa has been exposing himself to kids in Los Feliz.  Apparently, sir, he's decorated himself.
2 Decorated?	With tinsel and plastic icicles and... on his penis, sir.
3 I get the idea.  You got a description?	Of his penis, sir?

1 I want to know why you see him. Is it a Patchett payoff?	I see Bud because I want to.  I see Bud because he can't hide the warmth he has inside him.
2 I'll take your word for it.	I see Bud because he makes me feel like Lynn Bracken and not some Veronica Lake look-alike who fucks for money.  I see him because he doesn't know how to disguise who he is.  There's more if you want to hear it.

1 Let my Susie rest in peace!	Mrs. Lefferts, I just want to ask a few questions.
2 That other policeman already checked under the house and found not a thing amiss.	Officer White?
3 A sweet man.	Under the house.
4 All he found were rodents.  No signs of foul play.  So there.

1 The Grauman's Chinese pot bust. He just got off the honor farm.	What's he doing here, Sid?
2 You tight with the D.A., trash?	Sure, he just tried to throw me off the force last Christmas as a little joke.
3 How'd you like a little payback? Not to mention a donation to the widows and orphans fund.  Did you know Loew was a swish?	And Reynolds?
4 He's queer too.  Metro paid him two grand a week to fake it with ingenues.  On screen and off.  I'm getting him to fuck the D.A. for a hundred bucks.  That's twice the fifty you got for wrecking his career.

1 Yeah.  Me and Patchett go way back.	Pierce isn't like regular people. I dig him, but he scares me too.
2 Really?  How?	You know, when I came out to L.A., this isn't exactly where I saw myself ending up.
3 Yeah.  Me neither.

1 209 to anyone! I need some help here!	Who are you calling?!

1 You knew the deal. No contact.	Who was that other guy?
2 One of many people who would live a word with you.	Who are they?
3 You've heard of the National Security Agency?	What do they have to do with this?
4 That's who they are.	The NSA?
5 Yes.	You're crazy.
6 Okay.	Wait.
7 You drive a black BMW, license plate SRK1339?	Yeah.
8 I clipped this from your wheel well just before they towed your car away.

1 I intercepted phone calls.	How'd you get around the tap orders?
2 They can tap anything as along as it's an airwave intercept. Cellulars and pagers your kid can do.  Hard-line calls we'd pick off the relays as they were being fed into ground cables or fired up to the SATs. We'd suck in everything. All foreign, most domestic.  Domestic was my group. Druggies, radicals, loud-mouths. Anyone we wanted.	How'd you have the manpower to--
3 Meade has 18 underground acres of computers. They scan <u>every</u> phonecall for target words like "bomb" or "President". We red-flag phone numbers or voice prints...whatever we wanted. When the computers found something, it was bounced to comparative analysis.	Jesus.
4 That was twenty years ago. With digital? They can suck a salt grain off a beach.	Why'd you leave?
5 It was '72. I figured we had enough problems without monitoring a Berkeley kid's class schedule. So I sold my story to <u>Ramparts</u> and split.	They come after you?
6 Well...there'd be too much disclosure to prosecute me. So they ruined my records and made sure I'd never hold a real job again.

1 Drive.	We're not gonna hurt you.
2 Drive.	Tell him we're not gonna hurt him.
3 Drive or I'll blow your fuckin' head off.	No he won't.
4 Goddammit--	We're honest people and we need your help. I'll give you two- hundred dollars if you--

1 Feeling lucky?	Not particularly, no.

1 I know, but--	<u>Wildlife</u> footage, for God's sake. I don't see how he could've slipped you something that the FBI would be interested in.
2 That's my point.	<u>What's</u> your point.
3 Well, I need to find out as much about Daniel as possible.	Why?
4 Because my life is being ruined.	Daniel's life is already ruined. Maybe if you guys stopped thinking about yourselves for a change and--

1 Stacy?	How could you let me find out like this?
2 Stacy, I found out like this. This is the first I'm <u>hearing</u> of--	Robert--
3 It's not true.	"Sources revealed an FBI investigation into a possible money laundering scheme that may have sent millions of dollars--
4 I've seen it.	"At the center of the investigation are well-known Washington-area attorneys Robert Dean and Rachel Banks."
5 Yeah...look--

1 They're saying you killed that policeman.	That's gonna end tonight.

1 How's the trout?	It tastes like fish.
2 It is fish.	I mean it tastes like every other fish I've ever had. Every fish tastes the same.
3 Do you like fish?	Not that much.

1 Yeah?	We'd like to ask you some questions about Daniel Zavitz.
2 Who <u>are</u> you people?	I'm an investigator with Pro-Tech Security.
3 I went through this with an investigator this morning. If I could--	Mr. Zavitz was involved in an extortion scheme. We believe he passed you sensitive materials, possibly with your knowledge, and we need to--
4 He didn't.	We believe he did.
5 You're wrong.	We have good reason to believe that he passed you--
6 If he passed me materials, I'd have them. I don't.	We'd like to recover any materials Mr. Zavitz may have given you--
7 He didn't <u>give</u> me--	--otherwise we may have to--
8 Otherwise you may have to what?	We'd rather not--
9 Fuck you. You may have to what?

1 What's his name?	Brill.

1 It's okay to use the phone.	Alright!
2 No "900" numbers.

1 You think there was a connection to--	Jesus! I just told you. I don't know.

1 We found two sets of latent prints in the rubble of Brill's studio. One was Dean's. The other, we believe, belongs to Brill.	We believe?
2 Well...his real name's Edward Lyle.	Lyle?!
3 Yes sir.	You're kidding me.
4 No sir.	Dean's with Lyle.
5 And they have the video. That's confirmed.	So they know everything.
6 If they've looked at the video.	Oh, let's assume that they have.
7 If he's with Lyle it means he's got resources.	Resources, that's a good point. He's got resources. All we've got is a <i>six-hundred billion dollar</i> <i>organization!</i> Now god<u>dammit</u>, Hicks, you find 'em. You find 'em and you end it now!

1 Isn't Zerzura supposed to be protected by spirits who take on the shape of sandstorms?	What kind of fossils?

1 What am I looking at?	See what's happening to them - the stars.
2 They're so untidy.  I'm just trying to rearrange them.	In an hour there will be no stars. The air is filling with sand.

1 What else?	Marmite - addicted!  Baths - not with other people!  Islands.  Your handwriting.  I could go on all day.  My husband. Almsy nods.
2 What do you hate most?	A lie.  What do you hate most?
3 Ownership.  Being owned.  When you leave, you should forget me.

1 I just wanted you to know. I'm not missing you yet. She nods, can't find this funny.	You will.  You will.

1 And a good read.  Don't waste it.	Thank you.  Will you bury Geoffrey?  I know he's dead.
2 I'm sorry, Katharine.	I know.
3 Every night I cut out my heart but in the morning it was full again.

1 I'll be back as quick as I can. Thirty-six hours at the outside.	Try to get a second radiator, we'll bury it between here and the Pottery Hill. And a better jack. We planned badly.
2 Bermann!

1 No, I'll get you some tea. Wait till you're in Naples.  You'll find a girl there.	Just kiss me.  It would mean such a lot to me.
2 Would it? She kisses him, very softly, on the lips.	Thank you.

1 I could help you.  I could get you off that.	Can you cook the rabbit or will you try and bring that back to life?

1 Are you outside? A beat and then Caravaggio shuffles in.  Like an old boxer.	I can't hide anymore.  I breathe like a dog.  I lose my balance.  Stealing's got harder. Caravaggio stares at the Herodotus.
2 Why do I feel if I had your book I would know everything?	I don't even know if it is my book. The Bedouin found it in the plane, in the wreckage.  It's mine now. I heard your breathing and thought it might be rain. I'm dying for rain - of course I'm dying anyway - but I long to feel rain on my face.

1 But then the Queen looked up and saw Gyges concealed in the shadows. And though she said nothing, she shuddered. The next day she sent for Gyges and challenged him.  And hearing his story, she said this -	Off with his head!

1 There was a Prince, who was dying, and he was carried up the tower at Pisa so he could die with a view of the Tuscan Hills. Am I that Prince? Hana laughs.	Because you're leaning?  No, you're just on an angle.  You're too heavy!

1 This is Captain McGann.	Please, don't waste your time on pleasantries -

1 Hana was just telling me that you were indifferent -	Hey! -
2 - to her cooking.

1 I'll get another tin. Hana and the Patient are alone.	I didn't like that book either. It's all about men.  Too many men. Just like this house.

1 Will you come with me?	Of course.  When?
2 I mean home.  India.	Kip I -
3 I know - here I am always a brown man, there you would be always a white woman.	Is that what you think?  Is that what you think I think?
4 It's what I've learned.	I'm thinking about your heart, not your skin.  And how to reach it. And that I don't think I can.  A bomb has ruined us, just not the bomb I thought would ruin us.

1 Whoa - give me a chance!	Sorry.  I took a Benzedrine.

1 Certainly not.	I insist.  There clearly isn't room for us all, I'm the least able to dig, and I'm not one of the walking wounded. Those are facts.  Besides, if I remain it's the most effective method of persuading my husband to abandon whatever he's doing and rescue us. It's hard to argue with this logic.

1 You didn't answer the beeper either.	I hardly knew the guy. Why be impolite to strangers?
2 I don't recall authorizing you to have a personal life.	I don't recall asking your permission.

1 I've been following this guy for years. I'm your best shot.	How would you approach him? Hello, Mr. MacDougal, I'm Gin, would you steal a painting with me?
2 I'd need an introduction. From someone he trusts. Someone who owes us a favor.

1 You have a car?	Uh, yes.
2 Meet me in front. Five minutes.

1 I've got something for you.	Oh, that's quite all right. No charge.

1 You want me to pick up a painting?	Quite a good one. A Monet. Not major, but it is Giverney.
2 I'm not here to run errands. I'm here for the Mask.	If I can't trust you to pick up a painting, how can I trust you about the Mask?

1 Motorcycle.	Got it.

1 Why are we in separate--you know, separate rooms?	My job, my rules. We've got a job to do. No mixing business and pleasure.

1 Nice try. Everyone thinks I did.	That's because I wanted them to!
2 I wondered who'd been giving me a bad name.	I drilled the bolts and went in through the window. It was the only way to bypass the smart glass.
3 True enough.	You need a partner for this job. You'll never find one as good as me.

1 All this, this is a woman's version of what you would like.	It was a long time ago.

1 Certainly the most beautiful crook I've ever seen.	I've got something for you.

1 Ready?	Ready.

1 What?	A billion dollars.

1 Insidious thing, wondering if your partner...has another partner.	Okay, look, I'm delivering this to a man who's going to give us the key to our job. But it's pointless to try to explain it yet. You just have to trust me. I don't have any more secrets.
2 Everyone has secrets, it's what makes us human.

1 It's taken me five years at Webber Insurance, nights, weekends, every spare minute, to make this CD. It has all the necessary instructions and confirmation codes to tell their computer to transfer reasonably modest sums out of thousands of those accounts, two, or three million at a crack. Total, eight billion and change.	And the money goes--
2 Every wire transfer gets rocketed through a series of multiple switches. As soon as each deposit lands somewhere, it's shot somewhere else. It ends up so clean the Mafia couldn't find it.	But those instructions, they're recorded in the computer.
3 Nope. The CD instructs the computer to replace those instructions with an innocuous loan coded XJ-6.	A parting gift from the Empire.
4 Sit down, I'll show you how we're going to do it.

1 You shouldn't have.	Can't break tradition. It's bad luck.
2 There is one more thing.

1 Jesus God, it's going through.	Hong Kong midnight, happy new year. Except at China Bank.

1 What's wrong.	Nothing is wrong. Everything is the way it has to be. In my left coat pocket is a packet. Passports, hotel reservations, tickets.

1 The porta power...comm kits...got the IR/Thermo camera?	Had to get a liquid plasma screen.
2 The key to success is using the right tools.	You're not the one trying to get all this shit. You think they've just got a Crooks R Us on every corner?
3 We're going to need a vacuum with a battery pack for the dust. The air filters might be wired. And a bypass hose for the AC.	Sure wouldn't want you to be uncomfortable.
4 If we don't bypass it, the temperature in the Mask room will change and set off the alarm. That would be inconvenient.	Inconvenient is trying to find a pulsing laser with magic arms in two days.
5 You are a miracle worker.

1 Tonight your league night?	Check out my ball.

1 ... what we do in here is keep track of all the case files.  That way, at any time, we can find out a case's status -- where it is in the office, stuff like that.  We file 'em all here, alphabetically --	Oh, hell.  I'm dyslexic.
2 That's a joke, right?

1 Whoa.  Remind me.	Erin Brockovich.  Car accident.  Not her fault, she says.  And she looks like such an honest girl, don't you think?
2 You shouldn't judge, Brenda.	Right.  Lap-dancers are people too.

1 I added air conditioning, put in the pool, made all those pillows by hand ...	Yeah?  I should learn to do stuff like that. They make the place feel real homey.

1 It's a good day.  I feel good.	Well, then -- if you're feeling up to it, maybe we should talk shop.

1 I never lied.  I may have miscalculated -- that happens sometimes, but --	You said things would be fine, and they're not.
2 I'm sorry about that.  Really.  But --	I don't need pity.  I need a paycheck.  And I've looked, but when you've spent the last six years raising babies, it's real hard to convince someone to give you a job that pays worth a damn.  So I figure, since you're the one who said I was gonna be okay, you should be the one to hire me.

1 What are you doing here?	I got an interesting call this afternoon. It was from a Dr. Frankel.
2 Oh, yeah?	He wanted you to know the legal limit for hexavalent chromium, is .05 parts per million.  And that at the rate you mentioned, .58, it could be responsible for the cancers in that family you asked about. The Irvings.
3 Well, that was nice of him.  Isn't it funny how some people go out of their way to help people and others just give 'em the ax?	Look, I'm sorry.  You were gone.  I just assumed you were off having fun.
4 Now, why in the hell would you assume that?	I don't know.  Maybe cause you look like someone who has a lot of fun.
5 Boy, are you ever a shitty judge of people.

1 Boy, do I know how you feel.  First time I heard that number, I said you got to be kidding me.  Forty God damn percent?	Erin --
2 I'm the one who's injured, and this joker who sits at a desk all day is gonna walk away with almost half my reward?	Erin --

1 Is that what I think it is?	She lived on the plume.  You never know.

1 Hey.  I like working with you.	Well, good, Ed.  I like working with you too.

1 Holy shit.  Who do they represent, God?	Don't joke.  They might.  So do me a favor and behave yourself for once.  Ed Masry to see Kurt Potter.

1 If you're here to fire me, your timing's lousy.	I'm not gonna fire you.  I wanted to.  But then you got sick, and that woulda made me look like a shit.  You embarrassed me, Erin.
2 I know.  I'm sorry.  Do I get to hear what happened anyway?

1 How many counts?	Sixty-nine.  We've got good answers to all of 'em.

1 You know what, Erin?  I got nothing but time here.  Why don't you let me do that for you, and you can get your kids some dinner.	Ross -- you are an absolute angel.

1 Masry & Vititoe, can I help you?	Hi, Rosalind, this is Erin.  Brockovich. From the file room?  I was wondering if you could tell Mr. Masry that I'm following up on that real estate thing out of the office.

1 God damn it, Matthew.  What the hell are you doing out here?	I'm gonna go live with George.

1 You want my number?	I do.
2 Which number do you want, George?	You got more than one?
3 Shit, yeah.  I got numbers coming out of my ears.  Like, for instance, ten.	Ten?
4 Sure.  That's one of my numbers.  It's how many months old my little girl is.	You got a little girl?
5 Yeah.  Sexy, huh?  And here's another: five. That's how old my other daughter is.  Seven is my son's age.  Two is how many times I been married and divorced.  You getting all this?  16 is the number of dollars in my bank account.  454-3943 is my phone number. And with all the other numbers I gave you, I'm guessing zero is the number of times you're gonna call it.

1 What are you doing here?	Fixing a leak under your sink.

1 I'm bored, and so are the kids.	Just a few more minutes, then we can go.  Take her, will you?

1 Hello?	Hi.  It's me.  I got a favor to ask you.
2 I don't do favors for you anymore.	It's not for me; it's for my kids.  You're the only one I trust them with.

1 Know what I always thought I wanted outta life, Erin?  A Jaguar.	Jaguar's a darn pretty car.
2 I thought if I could spend that kinda money on a car, it'd mean everything else was fine.  I don't even know how much they cost.	A lot.  But you hang in there, maybe you'll get one.

1 You know that thing it says in here about rashes?	Uh-huh?
2 Well, this old neighbor of mine, Bob Linwood -- he ran the dairy on Community -- seemed like someone in his family always had a rash somewhere or other.  I just figured it was something in the genes.  And you know how it is -- you don't like to ask about things like that ...

1 My lord.	Come in, Admiral.

1 I can't ...	You must.  Luke, look at me!

1 Well, it's been awhile.	Barks and growls at his boss.
2 That was a long time ago.  I'm sure he's forgotten all about it, and so should you.

1 Okay, Chewie, it's now or never.	Barks his agreement.

1 The night storms will start before you can reach the first marker.	Then I'll see you in Hell.

1 I think we're in trouble.	If I may say so, Sir, I noticed earlier that the entire main para- light system seems to be damaged.
2 We're in trouble!

1 .... I'm afraid there's not much left.	What was it?
2 Droid of some kind.  I didn't hit it that hard.  It must have had a self-destruct ....	An Imperial probe droid.
3 Now don't panic.  We don't know that.

1 Asteroids!  Chewie, bank left, let's find out where they're coming from ...	Probably an asteroid field ....
2 Let's hope so ... it's just the chance we need.	To get killed ... you're not seriously going into an asteroid field?
3 Aren't I?  Hang on, sweetheart. We're gonna do some flyin'.

1 Sometimes, maybe ... occasionally, when you aren't acting like a scoundrel.	That's quite a compliment.

1 Sharp bank, Chewie.  Let's turn this bucket around.  You heard me, turn around!  Full power on the front shield.	You're going to attack them?!!!

1 No thanks.	Look, sweetheart, I'm not going to have you accusing my friend of ...

1 That ship saved my life a few times.  It's the fastest hunk of machinery in the galaxy.  What's wrong with her?	Hyperdrive.
2 I'll have my people get to work on it right away.  Hate the thought of the Millennium Falcon without her heart.

1 Hello!  What have we here?  Welcome, I am Baron Lando Calrissian, Administrator of this facility ... and who might you be?	You may call me Leia.

1 You'd better know what you're doing, or this is going to get very messy.	Don't worry about a thing.  I'll get us going.

1 Have they analyzed the one that was killed?	Not yet.  They're working on it now.

1 Artoo, you did it!  I never doubted you for a second ...	Let's go.

1 I will not fail you.  I'm not afraid.	You will be, my young one.  Heh. You will be.

1 Ben?  Ben?	Free your mind and return he will.
2 My mind fills with so many images.	Control, control you must learn of what you see.  Not easy, not fast.
3 I see a city in the clouds.	Bespin.  I see it too ... Friends you have there, heh?  Concentrate and see them you will.
4 I see them! ... They're in pain ... they're suffering.	It is the future you see.

1 The Hoth System?	Yes, Sir .... we have visuals ... the System is supposed to be devoid of human forms ...

1 To a lot of psychiatric small talk --	And we can watch ...
2 A display of primitive apparatus --

1 Somehow during the tour, she came into possession of a prototype transmitting device. We don't know how.	Utopia became depressed after her mother's suicide, began to withdraw into her virtual reality simulator. She'd punch up her own little world in cyberspace and stay in it for days at a time.  Somebody else was in there with her.

1 Where is he?	He jumped. Down there.  He's dead, Cuervo. I did it. I killed Plissken.

1 Wait a minute. I know that voice.  You're Carjack Malone.	Not anymore.

1 Wait a minute, what are you talkin' about?	Having second thoughts?
2 Maybe. But you're not putting any shit in me this time.	You don't understand. It's already in you.

1 It's the President, for Christ's sake!	I give you my word. Put the prototype into my hands, and you're a free man.

1 Where are they going?	Oh, man... You didn't have to hit me, Snake. I can help you.

1 Say, you need anything, Snake? Guns? Explosives? I can get you a crate of hellfire grenades, no problem - five hours.	Yeah. So how do I get to Venice?
2 All the sewers are collapsed under Venice. You have to go topside. Right up there.

1 Snake - what is it?	How the hell am I supposed to know? This is your damn city.

1 All of us?	Yeah.

1 Sir, your rage has unbalanced you. It seems you would fight to the death against a knight who is not your enemy, for a length of road you can ride around.	So be it, to the death.
2 It is you, sir, who knows not the virtue of humility, as a true king must.

1 My salvation is to die a Knight of the Round Table.	You are that and much more. You are its greatest knight, you are what is best in men. Now we will be together--
2 --It is the old wound, that has been opened. I have always known it would be the gateway to my death, for it has never healed. Let my heart do its job, my King, and pump me empty...

1 It's just that I have no experience, and no men to speak of. How can I--	Because you must! You and only you. Have you forgotten that it was you who freed Excalibur?

1 At your service, sir.	Then answer me this. For years peace has reigned in the land. Crops grow in abundance, there is no want. Every one of my subjects enjoys his portion of happiness and justice, even those whose tiresome misunderstandings we must resolve here each day. Tell me, Merlin: have we defeated evil, as it seems?
2 Good and evil; there is never one without the other.

1 The very spear that pierced the side of Christ as he died on the cross.	Your mother told you that?

1 He must stay for the feasting days of our wedding, and tell his deeds himself.	I grant you your wish if you grant Lady Guenevere hers.

1 Why didn't he kill us?	He has given up.

1 They do.	Why?

1 I swear it. By Excalibur and the holy--	--What issues from your lust will be mine. Swear it again.
2 I swear it.

1 It's a stylized ritual in which rabbis or priests try to drive out the so-called invading spirit. It's pretty much discarded these days, except by the Catholics who keep it in the closet as a sort of embarrassment. It has worked, in fact, although not for the reason they think, of course. It was purely the force of suggestion. The victim's belief in possession helped cause it; and just in the same way this belief in the power of exorcism can make it disappear.	You're telling me that, I should take my daughter to a witch doctor? Is that it?

1 I'm gonna miss you.	Me too.
2 Sure you won't change your mind?

1 But it's clean?	All right then we've got clean rats.

1 A disorder of the nerves. At least we think it is. We don't know yet exactly how it works, but it's often seen in earl adolescence. She shows all the symptoms: the hyperactivity; the temper; her performance in math.	Why the math?
2 It affects concentration.

1 So, how'd a shrink ever get to be a priest?	It's the other way around. The society sent me through med school.
2 Where?	Harvard, Bellevue, John Hopkins.
3 You're a friend of Father Dyer, right?	Yes am.
4 Pretty close?	Pretty close.
5 Did he tell you about my party?	Sure did.
6 About my daughter?	No I didn't know you had one.
7 He didn't mention?	No.
8 Didn't tell you of what she did?	He didn't mention her.
9 Priests keep pretty tight mouthed then?	That depends.
10 On what?	The priest.
11 I mean, what if a person, let's say, was a criminal, like maybe a murderer or something, you know? If he came to you for help, would you have to turn him in?	If he came to me for spritual help, I'd say no.
12 You wouldn't.	No I wouldn't. But I'd try to persuade him to turn himself in.
13 And how do you go about getting an exorcism?	I beg your pardon?
14 If a person was possessed by a demon of some kind, how do you go about getting an exorcism?	Well, the first thing I'd do is put them into a time macine and send them back to the sixteenth century.
15 I didn't get you?	Well it just doesn't happen anymore Mrs. MacNeil.
16 Oh yeah, since when?	Since we learned about mental illness, paranoia, schizophrenia. All the things they taught me in Harvard. Mrs. MacNeil since the day I joined the Jesuits, I've never met one priest who has performed an exorcism, not one.
17 Yeah well, it just so happens that somebody very close to me is probably possessed, and needs an exorcist.

1 Is she gonna die?	No.

1 Regan, why are you reading that?	Cause I like it.
2 It's not even a good picture. Looks to mature.	I wouldn't talk.
3 Oh you wouldn't talk, well I didn't have my make up man there.

1 Over behind the church, you know where I mean over there, it's a red brick wing?	St. Mike's.
2 What goes down there? I mean who's the priest I keep seeing, he's there all the time. He has black hair and he's very intense looking?	Damien Karras.
3 Karras.	That's his office back of St. Mike's. He's our psychiatric counsellor. He had a pretty rough knock last night poor guy, his mother passed away. She was living by herself and I guess she was dead a couple of days before they found her.

1 Do you like films?	Sure.
2 I get passes. In fact I got a pass for The Crest tomorrow night. Would you like to go?	What's playing.
3 Withering Heights.	Who's in it?
4 Heathcliff, Jackie Gleason, and in the role of Catherine Earnshaw, Lucille Ball.	I've seen it.
5 Another one. Had your lunch?	No.

1 Ydob eht ni mraw si ti! Uoy ees I! Tseirp a si eh! Emit su evig! Nirrem! Nirrem!	Who are you?
2 Tseirp a si eh! Eno on ma I! Eno on ma I! Ahhhhhhhhhhh!

1 Save me o' God by thy name, by thy might defend my cause, proud men have risen up against me, men of violence seek my life, but God is my helper, the Lord sustains my life and every need he has delivered to me, glory be to the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.	As it was in the begin is now and ever shall be, world without end, amen.
2 Save your servant	Who places her trust in thee, my God.
3 Be unto her o' Lord a fortified tower.	In the face of the enemy.

1 What is it?	Her heart.
2 Can you give her something?	She'll go into coma.

1 I cast you out!!! Unclean spirit...!	Shove it up your ass you faggot!
2 ...in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ!!! It is he who commands you! He who flung you from the heights of Heaven to the depths of hell!	Fuck him!!!
3 ...Be gone!!	Fuck him Karras!!! Fuck him!!!
4 ...from this creature of God!!!

1 Trunks?	Swimming trunks.
2 Oh. No. Strictly dryland.	Too bad.  You could use some sun. Really.
3 Maybe next time.	We have some lotion.
4 Just the same.	Suit yourself.

1 What do you say we go for a walk, pal.	Get your hand off me.
2 Come on, friend.  I can smell it on you. Get yourself a cup of coffee.  You'll forget what you're angry about.	Go fuck yourself.
3 You're a real tough guy when the ladies are around, aren't you, Ace?	I don't see any ladies here. Except maybe you.

1 Great.  Terrific.  Glad you could make it.	How we doing?
2 How we ... ? What, are you kidding me?	Am I late?
3 That's not the point.	What's the point?
4 You cannot continue to walk in at the last moment, Jack.	You want me to show up late a few nights?
5 Jack.	Frank.
6 Jack.	Frank.  I'm here.  I always get here.  Don't sweat it.
7 Christ, will you look at your hair?

1 What d'ya got?,	Bosen black.  Flat.
2 What d'you say, Willie?  Tighten her up?

1 So you'll come out, right?	Yeah, okay.

1 What are you, crazy?	I just thought we should talk about it.  Between ourselves.
2 What's there to talk about?  She can sing. That puts her at the head of the class. That makes her the only one in the class.	I don't know ... She had gum on her lip, for Christ sake. I don't think she's right for the act.
3 You're getting cold feet about this.	I was just thinking what Ma would think.
4 Ma? Ma?  Was Ma there the last time we played the Ambassador?  Oh, that's right, she was on bass. How could I forget.

1 Oh, brother.	And it's especially nice to be among friends tonight, because, well, tonight's a very special night for my brother and I. This evening we've asked a young lady to join us, a lady Jack and I are sure will soon seem like just another old friend to you all.  She's making her debut here this evening and, as far as I'm concerned, she couldn't be doing it in a better place. Because there's one place that's always been for us a very special place, and that place is this place, the Ambassador Lounge.  Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome a very special lady with a very special way of singing a song, Miss Susie Diamond.

1 November.  '71.	First night?
2 Day.  Wednesday.	Last?
3 Sunday.

1 What's the matter with you?	I'm sorry, Frank.  All that talk about family. I just got emotional.
2 How dare you say you love me.	It won't happen again.  Scout's honor.

1 They were simple songs.	Not for me.  I still have to look at the music sometimes, you know that?  Otherwise, I forget. I just forget.  But you.  You never forget. Ever.  So how come you couldn't remember Ma's birthday?
2 I told you.  It's a useless talent.

1 Stay off it.	No, let's stay on it.  I'm sick and tired of watching you make him up into some kinda god. For Christ sake, Jack, he died doing a stupid bullshit jig.  He left a wife and two sons.  He wasn't a hero.  He was a fool.
2 You weren't there.	That's right.  I wasn't there.  I don't have the luxury of being a witness to tragedy.
3 Fuck you.	No, fuck you.  And fuck him too. Fuck the both-of you.

1 Jesus, when was the last time we played the Mallory?	Five years ago.  November.
2 Right.  It was someone's birthday. Halloran?	Daughter's.  Sweet sixteen.
3 Christ, that's right.  How could I forget.  What a nightmare.	She asked for it.
4 I told Halloran we didn't do vocals, but he said:

1 You're an hour and a half late.	My watch is broken, too.
2 Punctuality.  First rule of show business.

1 What's the problem?	The problem is I can't hear myself sing with all this...  ... music.  You know what I'm saying?

1 The switch.  Hit the switch.	Switch?  What fucking switch?

1 You play all these places?	Baker's unabridged.
2 Jesus, you fellas've made a lot of noise.  What's with the stars?	Virgins.
3 Virgins?	First times. Hey, look at this.

1 What's with you two?	Jack woke up on the wrong side of the bottle.

1 Terrific, boys.  Really.  Terrific.	Thanks, Lloyd.
2 Yes, sir.  You're just what we needed on a night like this.	Uh ... thanks.

1 No, I, uh, left a dog here this morning. He needed some work on his mouth.	Regular hours are eight to five.
2 Yeah, yeah, I know.  I was just passing by. Thought I'd check in on him.	You can check in on him tomorrow. Between eight and five.
3 Yeah, well, couldn't I take a look now?

1 Where's egghead?	His kid's sick.
2 I don't know.  It's hard figuring you two as brothers.  Seems like the hospital might've scrambled the babies somewhere.

1 Relax.  We'll drop the song.	Guess I got a little scattered.
2 It's a shitty  song.

1 They'd been out dancing all night and he took her to the train station -- she lived over in Brookhaven.  Usually held ride with her, but this time he didn't.  Anyway, he starts walking home, only as he's walking he starts getting nervous.	Nervous?
2 By the time he gets to the corner newstand, he's got her meeting some rich guy on the train, the rich guy's asked her to marry him, and he's reading about it in the morning edition.	You're kidding.
3 He had a mind that escalated things.	So, what happened?
4 He calls her, asks her to marry him, she thinks he's crazy, he asks her again, she still thinks he's crazy but says yes anyway, and the next thing you know he's got his brothers down there and they're tearing the thing right off the curb.

1 Jack.	Hi.
2 Well, this is some surprise.  Hey ... You don't look so good, pal.

1 I tried Cheerios this morning. He didn't even get up. Maybe they took out the wrong teeth.	He's just feeling sorry for himself.  This is it, pal.  Hear me? Two bucks a can.

1 Waxy Wright.  Didn't Jon Archer bust you for poisoning five members of the Canadian parliament?	They never should've voted against U.S. statehood -- the scumbags.  We heard you got wasted.

1 Perfect fit.	Should be.  It's yours.

1 Do you know what it is to be in a coma?  It fucks up everything -- including your memory! I can't even tell you why Dobbs jumped me yesterday!	You porked his wife the day he was arrested.  How could you forget that?
2 I don't know.  Everything's jumbled -- so you're going to have to help me fill in a few blanks.	A few blanks?  Like what?
3 Like ...

1 Who is this?	Never mind that!  Just take Jamie and get out of that house.  Don't tell anyone where you're going -- especially not him -- just GO.
2 Okay, you're having an emotional crisis.  You need to seek the help of a trained --	Think about it, Eve! Everything he's done recently has been peculiar, right?  He's said and done things your husband would never do ...
3 Whoever you are, don't call again.	Don't hang up ...

1 We can send in a plant -- try to get Pollux to spill the location.	He'd see that a mile away.  The only person he'd talk to about that bomb is his brother.  Unfortunately, turnips can't talk.

1 You killed them?	Of course I killed them, you DUMB FUCK.  And torched every shred of evidence that proves who you really are.  Swallow this one, Commander. You are going to be in here for the rest of your life.
2 What are you going to do, Castor?	Let's not confuse things anymore.  I'm Archer. You're Castor.  But if you need proof --

1 SFPD?  Castor isn't stupid enough to come back to the city.	Trust me, he's already here. Get going!

1 You picked a helluva day to leave your beeper off!	What happened?
2 Castor's escaped!	Escaped?  From Erewhon?  I want everyone on this -- our entire force and the SFPD.

1 You'll need to recultivate that virus.	No problem.

1 I think -- you're trying to get me drunk.	Wouldn't be the first time -- or would it?
2 You wouldn't even sip champagne at our wedding. We were underage -- you wouldn't break the law.  Remember what my brother called you?

1 I'm going to the powder room.	Sure, baby -- go anywhere you want.  But I have to give you an escort.  Security reasons.

1 You think I like being here on Christmas Eve, Alan?	I don't know.  Maybe...

1 ...thats our war room. We did seven major deals last year, three of them hostile.	Seven.  Really.

1 They did a pretty good job.	Who did?
2 The aliens...In the mother ship.  You look just like him.	Uhh...thanks...slightly better looking though, right?

1 I know, I moved the Barca-lounger into the corner.  Its throwin everybody off.  What do you think?	Great room...

1 So Jack, its your wifes birthday, got anything to say to her?	Its your birthday? Today?  Whats your name?  Where were you born?

1 So you're telling me, you've got a gun to your head and you don't think for one second, what if this, what if that, maybe I shouldn't do this, I shoulda done that.	I don't do that.  That's just not for me...

1 Look, I dont know what youre getting so worked up about, you did this...you brought this on yourself.	Brought what on myself?! I didnt do anything!
2 No?  Cmon, Jack...Ive got everything I need, I dont have regrets, thats just not for me... sound familiar?	You mean because you thought I was cocky Im now on a permanent acid trip?!!

1 ...06...14...18...48...right there.  Four numbers...that's two hundred and thirty eight dollar...  Merry Christmas and shit...	Ticket bad.  You draw in lines with pencil.
2 What're you talkin' about?	You draw lines with pencil!  I know about this!

1 Merry Christmas to you, sir...	Thanks.  To you too...

1 I have a bad feeling about this.	About the plane? What do you think its gonna crash? Dont say that...
2 I know weve talked about this a thousand times and we both agree that going to London is the right thing to do. But in my heart... this feels wrong.

1 Yes, Im fine.  Its just this god awful football phone!  Who has a phone like this anyway?!	Uh huh...

1 How can you do that?	Do what?
2 Look at me like you havent seen me every day for the last twelve years...

1 How was the game, honey?	Long, boring, and generally pretty sad. Arnie seemed to enjoy it...  Hey, wheres that chocolate cake...?

1 You really are incredible...	Enjoy it, sweetheart...

1 Imagine having a life where everything was easy...where you asked for things and people just brought them to you...	Its wonderful...

1 Youre talking to their new Vice President of Mergers and Acquisitions.	What are you talking about, Jack?

1 Whats going on?	Im moving to Paris...it was right here...  Its a box marked Jack.  I put it in the stack for the Salvation Army...
2 Paris?

1 ...were really more of a boutique operation, as you can see...	But youre not interested in boutique dollars...  I get it...

1 I have to go to my parents' house out in Jersey.  Would you like to come?	Jersey?  You know what the traffic's gonna be like?
2 I'm taking the train...

1 I don't think She's real big on hate.	You wouldn't say that, if you could see me.

1 He <u>knew</u> about NASA.  What if he made the call to shut us down --	Ben, think about all the people we can help if this works --
2 Maybe you should think about <u>yourself</u> for once.  You always let this guy push you round --	We got what we wanted.  That's <u>enough</u>.
3 I know, I know.  I'm just worried about what <u>he</u> wants... Speaking of which...

1 What?  Come on.  She's got a good thing with Victor --	I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws?
2 He's smart, powerful, successful --	Well maybe <u>you</u> should date him.

1 Ben, I've been crunching the numbers on the machine.  I think if we can rework the power settings...	Forget it, egghead.  I'm good as is.

1 I'll be watching over you.	Just get back soon, or I start looking for a new groom.

1 He couldn't generate enough power for the machine to reach critical mass. Yet another mistake for "Mr. Fantastic."	And you can?  Power it up?

1 Your tissue, your organs, your entire biophysical structure is changing. Every system is still functioning, somehow --	And they're changing into...
2 I don't really know.  A compound organic-metallic alloy.  Stronger than titanium or carbon steel.  Harder than diamonds --	Like the shields Reed said would protect us.  How long?
3 At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --	What do you mean "complete"?
4 I wish I could tell you.  I can't pretend to know what we're dealing with here.  I'll notify the CDC and --

1 We should stay here until we can define the extent of our changes...	This place is deluxe.  You got cable?
2 ...and figure out how to reverse them. Let me show you to your rooms.

1 Me like-y.	Stay right.  Left is trouble.
2 I though we went over this.	Last one down springs for room service.

1 I'm driving.	Dude.  That's my sister.

1 Leonard, how's the feed?	Recording, sir.  We see you perfectly.

1 Got it.  So take a walk, Ben...I'm going to borrow Susan for a second.	Sure.

1 Those solar winds are flaring, but I factored them into my coordinates and --	I was talking about us.  Working together.

1 What?	We need to get past them.

1 What are you doing?	The plants, from space.  Their particles are still charged.  With the right amount of energy, those ions could <u>create</u> the elemental profile of the cosmic storm.

1 When I walked out, I waited <u>ten</u> <u>minutes</u> outside your door.  Ten. Waiting for you to come find me.	Why didn't you say something?
2 That would have kinda defeated the purpose.  And Reed...  I'm saying it now.

1 Victor, your scar --	I told you, I'm fine.  It's <u>you</u> I'm worried about.
2 I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --	Please, no apologies.  I've arranged for your things to be moved to one of my condos.  You'll have round-the clock care.

1 Where do we stand?	Medical's ready.

1 I told you to cut down on the sugar.	I can't help it. I'm just weak, I guess.

1 But why take the chance, when there must be other doctors?	We have no choice. Duval's the most skillful brain surgeon in the country, and he's right here, at hand.
2 I wouldn't know if he's trying to save him or kill him.

1 Yes, we'd like to get moving.	Why don't you go on. We'll meet you at the Clearance Desk in a few minutes.

1 Doctor...	Yes, Cora.
2 I -- I want to say...

1 That could be quite a lethal weapon... It could kill, not cure.	Not in the hands of a great surgeon like Dr. Duval. The beam of this laser can be regulated to one millionth of a millimeter.
2 I understand you've been Dr. Duval's Assistant for quite some time... He must've snatched you out of the cradle.	I've been with him since I got out of school. He brought me into the CMDF, over five years ago.
3 A long time, with one man.	Not working for someone like Dr. Duval --

1 Open it! Open it before they get here!	I can't till the hatch is flooded!

1 Nothing miraculous about it. Just an interchange of gases. The end product of five hundred million years of Evolution.	You can't believe all that's accidental? That there isn't a Creative Intelligence at work --

1 I'd hate to get lost on that Freeway...	They all lead to the same place -- the Lungs.

1 We need you for Security purposes, Mr. Grant.	At an operation?
2 They know they failed to kill Benes. Security thinks they'll try again, first chance they get. We're afraid of medical sabotage -- or surgical assassination.	Surgical assassination?! But that means you suspect --

1 In a way -- yes. Those are impurities imbedded in the Lung after a lifetime of 'Civilization.' Carbon from smoke and smog -- specks of dust --	Well, we better get on with it.

1 They're tracking us Topside. Once they see where we're going, I'm sure they'll take every precaution.	Let's hope they realize the danger.  Captain, I'll give you a new compass heading.

1 If it's no military secret, how can a sub run on a microscopic particle?	They can't reduce nuclear fuel. But once the Reactor's Miniaturized -- along with the submarine -- a microscopic particle should emit enough energy to activate it.
2 That's cutting it mighty close -- for a perfect fit.	It should work -- theoretically. If it doesn't, the mission's off. The craft's nuclear-powered. Except for your wireless.

1 Thirty-two minutes left...  But chances are we won't have to wait that long for try-number three.	Look at those Walls up ahead!

1 Doctor -- the channel's getting awful narrow.	We're entering a Capillary. Remain in the middle.
2 The Wall's transparent...	It's less than one ten-thousandth of an inch thick. And porous.

1 ... What is he, deaf?... So, uh, how long have you been with the escort service?	I don't know. Few munce.
2 Ya find the work interesting, do ya?	...What're you talking about?

1 ...You c'n'ave my truck. I'm takin' a Shiera.	We split that.

1 One hunnert's the best we can do here.	Oh, for Christ's sake, where's my goddamn checkbook. Let's get this over with.

1 Well, the little guy, he was kinda funny-looking.	In what way?
2 I dunno. Just funny-looking.	Can you be any more specific?
3 I couldn't really say. He wasn't circumcised.	Was he funny-looking apart from that?
4 Yah.	So you were having sex with the little fella, then?
5 Uh-huh.	Is there anything else you can tell me about him?
6 No. Like I say, he was funny-looking. More'n most people even.	And what about the other fella?

1 We're not horse-trading here, Wade, we just gotta bite the bullet on this thing.	Yah!
2 What's the next step here, Jerry?	They're gonna call, give me instructions for a drop. I'm supposed to have the money ready tomorrow.

1 ...Mr. Lundegaard?	...Brainerd?
2 Yah. Yah. Home a Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox.	...Babe the Blue Ox?
3 Yah, ya know we've got the big statue there. So you haven't had any vehicles go missing, then?	No. No, ma'am.
4 Okey-dokey, thanks a bunch. I'll let you get back to your paperwork, then.

1 ...Dad?	It's okay, Scotty.
2 Where're you going?	Be back in a minute. If Stan calls you, just tell him I went to Embers. Oh, geez -

1 What the heck were you thinkin'? Heck, if I'm only gettin' bank interest, I'd look for complete security. Heck, FDIC. I don't see nothin' like that here.	Yah, but I - okay, I would, I'd guarantee ya your money back.
2 I'm not talkin' about your damn word, Jerry. Geez, what the heck're you?... Well, look, I don't want to cut you out of the loop, but his here's a good deal.  I assume, if you're not innarested, you won't mind if we move on it independently.

1 Okay, so we got a state trooper pulls someone over, we got a shooting, and these folks drive by, and we got a high-speed pursuit, ends here, and this execution-type deal.	Yah.
2 I'd be very surprised if our suspect was from Brainerd.	Yah.

1 ...You can sleep, hon. It's early yet.	Gotta go?
2 Yah.

1 Nope.	Well, you do reside their at 1425 Fremont Terrace?
2 Yep.	Anyone else residing there?
3 Nope.	Well, Mr. Proudfoot, this call came in past three in the morning.  It's just hard for me to believe you can't remember anyone calling.

1 ...Chief Gunderson?	Copy. Yah, send me back-up!
2 Yes, ma'am. Are we the closest PD?	Yah, Menominie only has Chief Perpich and he takes February off to go to Boundary Waters.

1 Uh-huh.	We called his house; his little boy said he hadn't been there.
2 And his wife?	She's visiting relatives in Florida. Now his boss, this guy Gustafson, he's also disappeared. Nobody at his office knows where he is.
3 Geez. Looks like this thing goes higher than we thought. You call his home?	His wife's in the hospital, has been for a couple months. The big C.
4 Oh, my.	And this Shep Proudfoot character, he's a little darling. He's now wanted for assault and parole violation. He clobbered a neighbor of his last night and another person who could be one of your perps, and he's at large.
5 Boy, this thing is really... geez.	Well, they're all out on the wire. Well, you know...
6 Yah. Well, I just can't thank you enough, Detective Sibert, this cooperation has been outstanding.

1 This was a support group for men with testicular cancer.  The big moosie slobbering all over me was Bob.	We're still men.
2 Yes.  We're men.  Men is what we are.	Six months ago, Bob's testicles were removed.  Then hormone therapy.  He developed bitch tits because his testosterone was too high and his body upped the estrogen.  That was where my head fit -- into his huge, sweating tits that hung enormous, the way we think of God's as big.
3 They're gonna have to open my pec's again to drain the fluid.

1 Let's pretend.  You're the Department of Transportation, and you discover that our company intentionally did nothing about leather seats cured in third world countries with chemicals we know cause birth defects?  Brake linings that fail after a thousand miles.  Fuel injectors that burn people alive.	Just who the fuck do you think you are?!  Get out!  You're fired!
2 What about this?  Keep me on payroll as an outside consultant.  In exchange for my salary, I'll keep my mouth shut.  I won't need to come to the office.  I can do this job from home.

1 It becomes an addiction.	Really?

1 Picture yourself watching Marla Singer throw herself around her crummy apartment.	This isn't a for-real suicide thing. This is probably one of those cry-for- help things.
2 This could go on for hours.	So you're staying in tonight?
3 Do you want to wait to hear me describe death?

1 Well, that's a relief.  Thank you.	No... no problem.
2 I wish I could return the favor.

1 I don't want to hear anything you've got to say.	Give me a minute, Marla, alright... just sixty seconds.
2 Sixty seconds, then I'm out of here.	Absolutely, you have every right.  I need you to do me a favor.
3 I've done you enough favors.

1 What happened... ?	Don't ask.

1 -- But, in here, in everyone, there's the squint of a five-day headache. Yet they forced themselves to be positive.  They never said "parasite;" they said "agent."  They always talked about getting better.	Okay, everyone.

1 You see, when you travel, everything is small, self-contained--	The spork.  I get it.  You're very clever.
2 Thank you.	How's that working out for you?
3 What?	Being clever.
4 Well, uh... great.	Keep it up, then.  Keep it right up.

1 I don't know about this.	I don't know, either.  I want to find out.  I've never been hit, have you?
2 No.  That's a good thing, isn't it?	I don't want to die without any scars.  How much can you really know about yourself if you've never been in a fight?  Come on... you're the only person I've ever asked.
3 Me?

1 What are you reading?	Soldier of Fortune.  Business Week. New Republic.
2 Show-off.

1 You want to finish her off?	Uh... nah...

1 ... Marla ... ?	Fuck damnation.  Fuck redemption.  We are God's unwanted children, with no special place and no special attention, and so be it.

1 Hey.	Hey.

1 This conversation...	... is over.
2 ... is over.

1 You could be standing under 37 stories of steel and concrete with a 150 gallons of nitroglycerin strapped to the support... oh, maybe it couldn't be...	You... you can't be serious about this.
2 What a ridiculous thing to say.	I can't let you...
3 ...go through with this? What are you going to do?	I'm going to...
4 ...stop me?	I'm not going...
5 ...to let this happen!	Stop finishing...
6 ...your sentences!  They're our sentences.  Get your mind around that.

1 One minute.	I think this is about where we came in.
2 This is the beginning.  We're at ground zero.  Maybe you should say a few words, to mark the occasion.	i... ann....iinn.. ff....nnyin...

1 Do something for me.	What?
2 Appreciate something.	What?
3 Look at me...	What?
4 My eyes are open.

1 Biology, mostly.	Why?
2 I... I don't know...	What did you want to be, Raymond K. Hessel?

1 You have to tell us now.	I...I...

1 No!  It can't be.	I have to save Eugene!

1 So if you never got off the plane, none of us would be alive in the first place.	That's why Death is working backwards. It's tying up all the loose ends, sealing the rift once and for all This chapter of the screenplay contains scene that do not appear or occur elsewhere in the final movie. In order to maintain the integrity of the screenplay, it has not been edited.

1 You've made your point.	Good.  Cause we just got some new info and I don't need you getting freaky on me.
2 What?	Evan Shaeffer's dead.  Guess he wasn't as lucky as we thought.

1 Here's what I don't get.  For nine months, Death does all this shit to make sure I win these tickets and end up on Route 18 at exactly the right time for the pile up...	Yeah?
2 But why single me out?  What am I in the great scheme of things?  You'd think I stepped off Flight 180 or something... Fucking weird, man.

1 Pigeons... It's a sign!  If Clear's right about the order, then Nora and Tim are going to be attacked by Pigeons!	I'm not following you --
2 They're next on the list.  We have to find them.

1 Um, Kimberly?  This is a neighborhood. You may wanna slow it down.	Don't worry.  Nothing can happen to us.
2 I wasn't worried about us.

1 This trip better be worth it. What's the guy-girl ratio again?	Get ready to smile, five guys per girl.
2 I can live with thaaaa --

1 I know this is the first time we've been apart since.  But everything's gonna be okay.	I know, honey.  I just --

1 Mom?	Yeah?
2 You think... You think those guys were b.s.-ing us today or what?

1 Ahhh! fuck! You fucking asshole. You think this is funny, you fucking dick? Tod, if you're not dead I'm gonna fucking kill you!	Ohmygod! OHMYGOD!  OHMYGOD!  He's not dead?

1 I can't go home. After Lewton's, they'll be after me.	We're takin' you to a cabin in the woods, it's only a couple miles from my house.  Keep off the highways, they'll be lookin' for us.

1 Hope you don't think, Browning, that because my name ain't on this wall... that I owe you anything.	I don't.
2 All I owe is these people.  To live my life to the fullest.

1 Me, too.  But my dad doesn't understand. When he's better; you and me, road trip to the City. Catch the Yanks.	That's a plan.

1 And don't pass on the right.	Billy! I'm gettin' a vision!  You're the next one...
2 Hey, man, why'd you say that?!	'Cause if you say another word, I'm gonna fuckn' kill ya!

1 You guys are real... aren't you?	Huh?
2 Sorry, I mean... I talk to people all the time... I know a lot of them aren't there.  But this is real, isn't it?  You're taking me home now?	That's right, buddy.

1 Co Phuong Bao.  The guide takes us twelve klicks upriver to target at Ban... at Ban... Bo Peep.  Shit!	Start over.

1 That's it?  Some C-4, a map and a knife?	There's a compass in the handle.

1 How you doing, Brewer?	I need a vacation.

1 Can you handle the door gun?	Duck soup.

1 Are you okay?	Yes.  But I lose many merits in next life.  Very bad.
2 Why'd they want us?	They heard about escaped prisoner on radio.  Make deal.  More than we pay.

1 Stay on your heading, Captain.	Sorry, Sir.  Can't do it.
2 That's an order.	Sorry, Sir.

1 You think they'll find any?	POWs?  I don't know.  But either way it'll get that subcommittee off our necks.  Cream?
2 Black.  No sugar.	The League of Families leans on Congress.  Then they lean on us. Like we don't have enough to worry about in a dozen dirtwater countries.  Damnit!

1 What's your name?	De Fravio.  Dave De Fravio. Lieutenant... Air Force.

1 This will last you one year after which you have the option to renew if... you like at a membership discount.	But now it's free, right?
2 Yeah.

1 You know, let me tell you something! I'm not that kind of person. I don't do people favors. If I talk to you it's because I want to. So we're not all ...uh...Jerri Hall...Big deal... What a boring world if we were. You do the best you can with what you got. You're not so so invisible, ya know... You want make an impression? Try this; you can be a real bitch.	Really?
2 Yeah!

1 It happens to be a beautiful love story.  Ya know, you used to like that about me.  You used to say you liked that I didn't make you think so much.  That we could be together and not think...	Yeah, well... suicidal paranoiacs say funny things sometimes.

1 I was not with a woman last night.  I was out with Parry.	The moron?
2 He's not a moron.	And who's Lydia?
3 Lydia is the girl Parry likes... And I thought, if I could get them together I...	What?  The curse'll be lifted?  <u>Will</u> <u>you please</u>!
4 I... You're not going to understand this.	Don't treat me like I'm stupid.  It pisses me off.
5 All right... Sorry... I feel indebted to him.	What does that mean?
6 See, I told you!	Well, what the hell does that mean?
7 I thought... if... if I can help him in some way... you know?... get him this girl he loves... Then... maybe.... things'll start changing for me... My luck, ya know... Maybe...  Forget it... It's a stupid idea.

1 Ugh, these tapes are a mess.  I don't know where to begin...	... I would love to start looking at least.  You know, maybe a two bedroom or even, maybe the top floor of a house -- like in Brooklyn or Staten Island...

1 So, Edwin, baby, this is Sunrise Confession time... what have you got for us?	I... I... went to this bar... this very, ya know -- hard-to-get-in place... called Babbitt's...

1 Remember. One chorus and out.	I'm a man with a mission, Jack.

1 Hello. My name is Lydia Sinclair.	Yes. Hi..Congratulations. Jack Lucas. Nice to meet you finally. This is Anne Napolitano, the owner of Video Spot.

1 Have I died?	Hahahahaaa... Nononono... Not yet... Hahahaha...
2 If you're going to murder me, that's fine... just don't laugh.

1 I'm not married.	Funny -- you look married.

1 ...You are such a great guy. First the money, now this.  Isn't he fabulous!?	Please don't hug me in public again, O.K.?
2 I LOVE THIS MAN...YA HEAR ME JADED CITY...  ...I'M DAFFY ABOUT THIS GUY AND I DON'T CARE WHO KNOWS IT!!!

1 You can't do this! This is New York! Nobody lies in naked in a field in New York..It's...it's too Midwestern.	Come on, try it. Ya feel the air on your body - ya little fella's flappin' in the breeze. ...everybody in the city is busy with their business and no one knows we're bare assed in the middle of it. Come on!
2 NO! I will not! This is nuts! I'm leaving! I mean it...this is nuts.  This is too nuts...I'm leaving. I mean it!

1 You a fag too?	<u>Fag..a</u> <u>fag</u> <u>you</u> <u>say!?</u>... <u>"Curst</u> <u>wolf!</u> <u>Thy</u> <u>fury</u> <u>inward</u> <u>on</u> <u>thyself</u> <u>Pray</u> <u>and</u> <u>consume</u> <u>thee!"</u>
2 Fuck you.

1 We mostly publish trashy romance novels.	Well - empires have fallen because of trashy romances...

1 If you're sayin' you're somethin' better'n what I am, that's one thing. But I can't say much a someone who'd run off an' leave a woman in a situation like this an' feel easy about it. An' that's all I gotta say.	I hope that's all you gotta say, El, 'cause I'm about as tired of your mouth as I am workin' this stinkin' hole!

1 Is it my turn again?	Right. Now show me a little somethin' this time, okay? Give me some form...

1 Just one minute, you! Don't you ever talk to me like that!	Shut up! All of you!

1 Come on.	Wait a sec. I want Tita to take a picture of you an' me in front of the place...
2 No, let's go...

1 Fantastic! That you could figure all that out, and lay that down on her, to come up with a way you could get your toast.	I didn't get it, did I?
2 No, but it was very clever... I would of just punched her out.

1 Oh my goodness... Bobby...	Hi, Tita.

1 Well...  I better let you...	Wait...

1 Well, you're not going to run out on me right away, are you?	I don't know.

1 Bye, now.	Bye, Robert.

1 That was beautiful, Robert. I'm surprised...	Thank you.
2 I was really very moved by the way you...

1 No inner feeling.	That's right.
2 I don't believe vou.

1 And living out here, in this rest home asylum, that's what you want?	Yes.
2 That'll make you happy.	I hope it will, yes.  I'm sorry.

1 That's three games to none, Carl.	All right, let's have a rematch.
2 I thought you had to go to the mainland today. Aren't you going to miss the ferry?

1 What's wrong, Carl, you hardly ate anything...	I took some aspirin and it really upset my stomach.

1 And you know, I read where they invented this car that runs on... that runs on... when you boil water...	Steam.
2 Right, steam. A car you could ride around in and not cause a stink. But do you know, they will not even let us have it. Can you believe it? Why?! Man! He likes to create a stink. I wrote them a note once, and told them to clean it... I mean, don't you see that? It's just filthy! I mean, I've seen filth you wouldn't believe! Oofh, what a stink! I don't even want to talk about it...

1 Who are you?	I'm wit' Carlos.

1 Come down!	I can't!

1 I gotta go take a piss.	If we were at 10th Street Pool you woulda done it right in the water, right?

1 You sure? She's got kind of like brown hair.	Positive.
2 You sure?	Positive.
3 My friend told me she lived around here.	Your friend must be misinformed.
4 Didn't I see you at Pitt yesterday?

1 Maybe tonight?	Whaddyamean 'maybe'?
2 That's what he said.	He doesn't know? How come he doesn't know?
3 I don't know how he doesn't know. He doesn't know.	Sonofabitch.
4 Wonder who his supplier is.	I have no idea.
5 I wasn't asking.	He never leaves the beach, Fat Sam. Never leaves. Sits in that chair, he's outta junk. Then he suddenly gets up, he's got junk. So where does it come from? Through the sand?
6 I think that's highly unlikely, Creasy.	I ought to get some sleep.
7 Creasy, how old are you?	Nineteen.
8 You're not taking real good care of yourself.

1 Can I call my Mom? I'd like to tell here how much I've always loved her.	What'll it be Fletch?

1 So where do you know Alan from?	We play tennis at the club.
2 Really. The California Racquet Club?	Yes.
3 That's my club too. I haven't seen you there.	Well, I haven't played in a while because of these kidney pains.
4 Right, and how long have you had these pains, Mr. Barber?	That's Babar.
5 Two bs?	One. B-a-b-a-r.
6 That's two.	But not right next to each other. I thought that's what you meant.
7 Arnold Babar. Isn't there a children's book about an elephant named Babar?	I don't know. I don't have any.
8 No children?	No books. No elephants either. No really good elephant books.
9 Still, it'd an odd name. I don't remember seeing it on the club registry.

1 Refusal to pay alimony is a jailable offense, Fletch.	What about breaking and entering?  Are you wearing anything under that?
2 I did not break nor enter. I simply chose an advisable location to await my client's delinquent husband.	I hate to conduct business on the lanai. Why don't we step inside.

1 Bravo, Mr. Fletcher.	The thing that really tipped it off for me was something your wife said to me while we were in bed together.

1 He sighs.	And they're still married... Alan and Sally Ann.
2 Of course they are.

1 Where does the Chief get the drugs?	I dunno. Somewhere in South America, I forget.
2 Rio de Janeiro, maybe?	Maybe, Fletch. Is that Brazil?
3 That's Brazil.	Yeah. Maybe.
4 Wait here for me, Gummy.

1 Will you kill me?	Sure.

1 I overheard it. He thinks you're completely out of control, he said he was gonna can you as soon as he got the story. If I were you, I'd just chuck it, Fletch. Screw him. Let him eat three full pages on Sunday.	You kidding? I got an unbelievable story here, Lar. Un-believable. Jesus. It's the cops, I know it. The Chief! And they're all over Frank.
2 I just thought... sure.  Sally Ann Cavanaugh.	Check every hotel in L.A. Start with the ones near the airport. Yeah. He's about to leave the country with her. Thanks, Lar.

1 What's he doing in Utah?	None of your business, now go away. You're throwing my game off.

1 Thanks for the great time.	What is this?
2 Long story.

1 I've never lied to him before.  It's the first time he's ever lied to me. He was just as convincing as when he says 'I love you.'	I think you better sit down.
2 Oh God, I hate things that start like that....	Gail, please.

1 Excuse me. I have something I'd like to discuss with you.	What?

1 Just kidding, Frank. You'll have the story and you'll be damn proud of it.	You broke it? You know the source?
2 Practically.

1 And, I'm sorry, who are you again?	Frieda's boss.
2 Who's Frieda?	My secretary.

1 No thanks.  I carry my own.	Excuse me?
2 Let's see, you're her worried sister.  Yesterday I met her worried father who incidentally was about five years younger than you. In fact, I capped off the evening by watching him get electrocuted. They talk about cases like this in the private eye handbook... something about a ten-foot pole.

1 That was close...	What did these Vancouver factories do?

1 Your tip paid off.  Jazz, this is Sam the Sleazebag.  Sam the Sleazebag, this is Jazz, my secretary.	Assistant.  And don't call me Jazz.
2 All your friends call you Jazz.	Exactly.

1 You going to be okay?	Go on, 'they're stahting.'

1 I came to warn you...	Oh, Jazz, those bastards... call an ambulance!  Get that music off!

1 A simple 'please' would suffice...	Fluck you!

1 Let's watch some 'M.T.V.'	People still watch that?
2 Who cares about people?

1 Pretty smooth, huh?	Smooth.  I know this is dangerous and everything but it's kind of fun. Ever see "Batman," you know when Batman and Robin are climbing up the side of the building and somebody sticks their head outside the window and says... I forget what they said but it's pretty funny.
2 Why have you come to my planet?

1 Fairlane, you gonna find out who killed the lead singer of Black Vomit?	Tell me, Dr. Watson, what makes you think he's not just another piece of shit overdose.

1 It's me.	What kind of sentimental bullshit is this?
2 Hey, I love you, too, you little jerk.  Jesus, guy tries to make a commitment and he's gotta eat shit.	Who's my real father, man?
3 He, he, lives in South America... he's doing that anthropologist- archeologist-dentist kind of thing ... he's real busy.

1 How's it going?	You gotta be kidding!  This is unfuckingbelievable!  I have to start the evening crawling down Capital Records, I shoulda chose suicide then, but oh no, the night was young!  Next up, my guitar! The second most important thing I own and now it's toothpicks for the homeless on Hollywood Boulevard!  Then, then, after I burned up your brother, Jazz... I should say as a fucking footnote I've usually treated women like shit -- used corsages, the wet spot, you know giving out Domino's Pizza's phone number and saying it's mine... Tonight was different. I felt respect.  I felt love.  Then Jazz left me... and <u>now</u> I get to die!
2 The point?	Let me go out like a man.
3 Anyway you want it, asshole.

1 It doesn't have to be like this?	Oh God, please, <u>don't</u>!

1 You're that guy, the private eye.	You're a poet and didn't know it.
2 Do you really know everybody in the industry?	Only on a first name basis.
3 That's cute.  You're funny.	That's funny, you're cute.
4 You heard that Bobby Vomit O.D.'d, right?  Do you suspect foul play and stuff?	I'll tell you when somebody pays me to give a shit and stuff.

1 Did I say you could move that hand -- I'm not gonna get stuck am I?	No - no.
2 Cause if I do.

1 Allo... Salvatore...	Who's this --
2 ... Salvatore?...

1 Sale boulot.	Il fallait le faire.
2 Il est en retard.	Je crois qu'on fait une erreur de le prendre avec nous.
3 Une erreur!  C'est gnial.  C'est une vedette  la tlvision.  Il peut aller partout sans tre souponn... En plus il a besoin de fric.	J'ai pas confiance en lui.
4 Sois gentil avec lui.  On ne sait jamais.  Il peut te faire travailler  la tlvision.

1 I'm sorry, I don't know who you mean.	He got off on six.
2 We have four rooms and six suites on six.  There's a man in almost every one of them.

1 Christ you should o' collared him right there.	Who's on him?

1 I make at least two junk connections at that table in the corner.  The guy is the stripe combo, I know him too.	Hey, I thought we come for a drink.

1 We got information that there's no shit in the street -- it's like a desert full of junkies with a big score coming in to make everybody well.	This could be it, Walter.  This Candy Store guy, putting on a big show in a fancy nightclub with known connections all over him. Then on our own, after working the whole day and night, we tail him out to Brooklyn and sit on him for a week practically, and who do we come up with?  Joel Weinstock.  You gotta let us have it.

1 My ass.  The only reason you're in this is because you've got a big expense account for buying junk and you like to see your picture in the papers.	This is my case.  Get these guys off my back and let me handle it.

1 So whatta you want a badge?  It's your first major league game Sal. One thing I learned, move calmly, move cautiously.  You'll never be sorry.	I been damn careful up to now.
2 Which is why your phone lines are tapped and the Feds are crawlin' all over you like flies.	I'm straight, Joel.  They haven't got shit on me.  Look, I'm tellin' you, he'll take the deal somewhere else.
3 He could go someplace else with his sixty kilos of heroin and see how easy it is to pull together a half million cash.  He wouldn't find there was any hurry to do this kind of business.

1 Frank.  Hey, man.  You alright?	I'm alright, Gibby.

1 Frankie, Johnny wants to say goodnight.	Sure.

1 Hey, bud.	Frank...

1 What if I could prove it to you, Satch?	How's that?
2 What if I told you that in the bottom of the 6th we're gonna be down 3-0.  And Cleon Jones is gonna get hit in the foot. It's gonna leave a scuff mark on the ball.	Frank, please...
3 The next batter, Clendenon, hits one outta the park.	Frank, this is insane...
4 In the bottom of the 7th, Weis is gonna hit a solo home run.  Jones and Swoboda are gonna score in the 8th.  The Mets are gonna win 5-3.  Go watch the game, Satch.	Go watch the game?  Go watch the fucking game?  Frank, they're gonna make you for Sissy Clark's murderer.  It matches the Nightingale's profile.  You understand what that means?

1 Are you licensed to broadcast, buddy?	Look, I don't really remember how this thing works.
2 Listen, you can't broadcast without a license.  Unless this is an emergency, you gotta get off the band.	Pal, my whole life's an emergency.

1 What the hell...	I'm dreaming this.  Shit, this is a dream.
2 I'm not dreaming.

1 You're still my Little Chief, right?	I'm trying to be, Dad.  I'm tyrin'.  It's good to hear your voice.  I missed you...so much.

1 When?	October 22, 1969.
2 Jesus Christ...that's...ten days from now.  How?

1 John, say hello to my wife...Julia.	H-hi.

1 John, you there?	Yeah, Dad.  What the hell is going on?
2 Satch is busting me for Sissy Clark's murder.  John...

1 My father didn't die in a fire?	Huh?
2 My father didn't die in a fire?	Fire?  What are you talking about?  He had cancer, John.
3 Cancer.  It was the cigarettes.  Right? The cigarettes?	Yeah, lung cancer.  Ten years ago.

1 That's what we need here, Satch.  A lucky break.	That wasn't luck, Johnny boy.  That was smarts and ten plus on the job.

1 Hey, future boy.  Frank tells me you're a cop?	Yeah, that's right.

1 Who the fuck is this?	Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
2 Sullivan?	You have the right to speak to an att --
3 Fuck you, asshole.	It's a small world, Carl.  And I'm gonna find you.  Real soon.

1 So what would a weekend in the country be without sex?	Cool it, Andy.
2 I didn't mean it the way it sounded...

1 What're you doin'?	I think it's called "a shower". You might try it sometime.
2 You're too clean for me.

1 Here.  Go down the cellar and check the fusebox.	Will you come with me?
2 Be a man, man.

1 Look what I found.  Remember these?	Did you stay here last night?
2 No.  I got here just before you did.	Somebody was in here.
3 Goldilocks and the Three Bears?	I'm serious.  Doesn't this look a little strange to you?

1 Hi.	You're Shelly?
2 I'm sorry.

1 Got any good ideas?	Maybe.

1 I thought that was the end of the song.	Great.  Just great.

1 Don't worry about it.  Just stay cool.	Stay cool?  You ain't Dirty Harry. Now stop it.

1 You become a whole other person when you're out here, Stan.  And I don't like it.	This is a man's game.  Requiring a man's cunning and intelligence...

1 No.  No, it's not...	Yes, Megan.  Tommy Jarvis is a killer.  A very deranged boy who wants you to believe that...

1 Are you sure this is gonna work? I mean, why didn't we bring that gun and just blast him away?	It probably wouldn't have any effect on him.  The only sure way to stop Jason is to return him to his original resting place, where he drowned in 1957.
2 Lake Forest Green?	Crystal Lake...where the nightmare began.

1 But what if they try and scare us?	We'll scare 'em right back.

1 Aren't you the kid whose mother and friends were....	Yeah.  Jason murdered them and...
2 And you've been at some psychiatric clinic ever since, haven't you?	Yes, but they released me because...

1 You got me where you want me. There's no reason not...	If I had you where I really wanted you, they'd be pumping your ass full of formaldehyde.

1 Anything else?	Yes.

1 Jesus!	Sorry, Di.  I was just going to my car.  I didn't mean to frighten you...
2 It's...It's all right.

1 She's beautiful.	Her name's Stephanie.
2 She's yours?

1 I'll be back later.  You just be cool, okay.	Okay.
2 Don't do anything stupid.	What am I gonna do -- I'm locked up in a friggin' cell?!
3 I'm gonna get your outta this.  Just hang tight.  Okay?	Okay.

1 I hear the crew members are cute guys in their twenties.	Really?
2 I'm sure we'll have no problem getting them to party with us...especially with this.

1 What's wrong?	Nothing.

1 She never should've set foot on this ship. This is your fault!	This is Jason's fault!
2 Not another word, do you hear me??

1 You have no right...	And neither do you. It's up to Rennie to decide what she wants to do.
2 She doesn't know what she wants. She's never had a stable life.	And she sure doesn't have one now, either. She needs to live.
3 I'm her legal guardian, not you or anybody else, and I alone know what's best for her. End of discussion.	No, I think it's just the beginning.

1 Everyone split up -- we'll cover more ground that way.	I don't think that's such a safe idea
2 My niece's life hangs in the balance right now!! Every second counts.

1 Get in the boat, Rennie!	I...I can't...
2 You can and you will!!

1 When did this start?	About four years ago...at Crystal Lake. I spent a few summers there with Uncle Charles inbetween boarding school.
2 After your parents passed away?

1 I think so. But we have to lower the anchors so we don't drift any further...	Where are they?
2 The bow...front of the ship. There's a hoist on each side that lowers them

1 We must abandon.	What do you mean, we must abandon?
2 Ruptured steam pipe.

1 Very dangerous.	Asbestos lining.
2 We must abandon.	Do not inhale.

1 We were thinking of putting in a pool.	`The most interesting thing about Elliot Litvak is that he writes the way he looks -- fuzzy, grubby and shifty-eyed.'  I'm telling you as a friend.
2 What?	There are things that speak to us from the past.

1 I used to tell myself. Talent is more erotic when it's wasted. Will I see you tonight?	The Red Sox blow a chance to win their first World Series since 1918. You expect me to miss that for an opening night?

1 Look. I'm sorry you keep running into dishonest men. But you're only eighteen. We can still turn it around.	Except I won't have a father anymore.
2 I'll see you all the time. I'll get a place right nearby. One room. No distractions. We'll talk.

1 Am I really so deeply repugnant?	Yes.

1 Life is good.	Life is good.

1 We must have been heroic.	Five's not so many. There were families with seven kids. A grandmother. A dimwit uncle.
2 Lillian says it once a week. `Why doesn't he come live with us?'	You know the answer to that.
3 I do know the answer to that. Why don't we watch the ball game later? We'll go to Mannion's.	They're only gonna lose.
4 Of course they're gonna lose. We'll watch them lose. What good is heartbreak if we don't experience it firsthand?	The Red Sox are your problem. I never understood about you and the Red Sox. Everybody rooted for the Yankees.

1 It's a complicated subject.	It's a simple subject.

1 They're my team, too. I grew up on Boyleston Street. Right by Fenway Park. I went to fifty or sixty games a year. All by myself. I was one of those kids with scabby elbows. I called out to the players. `Look over here. Hi, I'm Steven. My parents are divorced.'	I went to college in Boston so I could be near the Red Sox. I took summer classes and the cut them to go to the game. My wife is from Boston. Lillian Ziegler?
2 The Red Sox were my world. I surrendered my existence to a team that couldn't win the big one.	If you're such a devoted fan, why were you at the play tonight instead of the game? Answer carefully. This is important. You could have gone to the theater last night. There was no game last night.
3 Because I can't bear to watch. When they lose, I die inside. It's like some little person named Steve just crumples up and dies. I wait for the scores. I still die, hearing the scores, but it's over in a second. I can't survive the game pitch by pitch, inning by inning. I've done it too many times. And I can't do it anymore.

1 Yessiree, Bob.	Get the hell out of here. I don't want you bringing our food. Send a real waiter.

1 He feels he has to defend himself if necessary.	I'm actually beginning to enjoy this.

1 Please! You're being foolish!	There's no room! And the air is lovely.

1 Just an admirer...	Nothing's more dangerous, especially for an old man.

1 They're calling you "Bapu." I thought it meant father.	It does. We must be getting old, Charlie.

1 What can we do?	We must end the campaign.

1 And you've come all this way because you think something is going to happen?	Hm.  Is it?
2 Perhaps. I've come here to think about it.

1 The honor is ours. May I introduce Mr. Kallenbach. He's an old friend  and his interest is in flowers. I presumed to tell him he could wander your gardens while we talked.	I'll send my gardener. I'm sure you'll have much to discuss.

1 In England, I was a poor student but I --	That was England.

1 I'm glad to hear you say that... very glad. You see if we repeal the Act under pressure  under this kind of pressure it will create a great deal of resentment. Can you understand that?	Very well.

1 He was right. It's insane -- anything would have been better.	Have you found him?

1 I'm sorry, there's no way we can.	Don't worry.  You'll probably do just as well singing to him in the womb.  We can implant the most successful pre-embryo tomorrow afternoon.

1 Of course.  He's a "de-gene-erate".  He works at Gattaca.  Why else would we find the eyelash near the washroom?  Nobody stops to take a leak during a murder.	It's still possible the eyelash specimen came from a janitor, delivery man--it could have blown in through an open window.

1 Would you care to look--in the telescope?	Thank you, no.
2 One look through there and you would know why I can't possibly allow you to disrupt operations any further.	You're so unconcerned that you have a killer in your midst.
3 Right now, <i>your</i> presence is creating more of a threat.  I don't think you have any concept of what we do here--how meticulous our preparations must be.  We are about to send twelve people through 140 million miles of blackness to rendezvous with an object the size of a house and the color of coal.  So it's rather critical to point them in the right direction. And we certainly don't need you looking over our shoulders.  Besides, I don't believe there is any evidence that the killer <i>is</i> amongst us.  I don't see too many other dead bodies littering the place.	No, but since there aren't too many <i>live</i> ones tonight either, you won't mind us conducting one further sweep.  If he does not work here, then there should be no other trace of him.  I think you'd better get some people out of bed, Detective.  In the meantime we can re-check his favorite haunt.

1 I don't know exactly, Jerome.	At least you're honest.  Call me by my middle name--Eugene--If you're going to be Jerome, you may as well start getting used to it.

1 I gotta stop!!  I gotta stop!!	Keep going!!  Keep going!!

1 You really had other offers?	I'm sure I could have.

1 Why have you done this?	In case you get back before I do.
2 Where are you going?	I'm travelling too.

1 Yeah.	I'd have to bleach my hair.
2 Why are you inventing problems?  You two are a couple of goddam clones.  You look so right together, I want to double my fee.	How tall are you?

1 You didn't know?	Yes...<i>yes</i>...
2 You're angry--	Why would I be angry?  It was beautiful.

1 What is it?	I forgot something--something at home. I'll see you later.

1 The doctor will give you something.	I'm not doing it.
2 Honey, you've made <i>one</i> mistake--

1 Three... Rudy got ambitious.	And you got him...
2 That's right.

1 Feel good?	Yeah.
2 Where do you want to go?	I want to take a walk.

1 I'll be okay.	Listen, I'm just as nervous as you are.
2 Really?	Really.

1 Promise you won't laugh.	If it's funny I'm going to laugh.
2 I feel like the night before the first day of school.	That bad?

1 There better be a guy with the	You bastard...

1 From now on you just shut up and do as you're told.	If I hadn't killed Beynon., you would have.

1 We better stick here till tonight.	Yeah.

1 Come on, come on.	Who was it?
2 Just get your clothes on...

1 Hope you get to where you're going.	Thanks. Hope you do too.
2 By the way, you're getting a hell of a car there, mister.

1 I guess you ain't gonna shoot me, are you?	I kinda doubt it.

1 Something ought to loosen him up ... how comes we're going to El Paso, Rudy?	I Just want to find a suitcase.

1 You know what the bloody time is!  It's two o'clock in the bloody morning!	I know.
2 Well?

1 No, don't Jack, don't.	Who sent you, Thorpey?
2 Brumby!

1 You know Sid Fletcher?	What?
2 You know Sid Fletcher?	I work for him.
3 Do you?	Yes, I do.

1 That's why you waited for me.	Not entirely. No.
2 You sure about that?	Sure I'm sure.

1 Where you going to live, then?	At me friend's house.
2 Where's that?	Wilton Estate.
3 Nice family, are they? Church-goers and all that?

1 See you later.	Where you off to?
2 Las Vegas.

1 What is it?	My brother, Frank.
2 Is he staying the night?	Funny.  Can I phone London?
3 It'll cost you.

1 So shut up.	What's that gun doing in your room? Suppose I phoned the police and told them there's a bloke staying in my hotel who's planning to shoot somebody?
2 You wouldn't.	How'd you know I wouldn't?
3 'Cos I know you wear purple underwear.	What's that supposed to mean?
4 Think about it.

1 What's it to you anyway?	I've always ad your welfare at heart, Eric. Besides which, I'm nosy.
2 That's not always a healthy way to be...	And you should know, if I remember rightly.

1 Gerald phoned us in the middle of the night, said he'd heard you've been making a nuisance of yourself.	We've got to take you back to London.
2 He said it'd be doing him a big favour.

1 What's that?	That, Harry? That's another hundred - twenty-five pounds notes of the realm.
2 Three hundred altogether?	Three hundred altogether, Harry.

1 It's not.	No.

1 How many leads have we got?	The Glengarry...the premium leads...? I'd say we got five thousand.  Five. Five thousand leads.
2 And you're saying a fella could take and sell these leads to Jerry Graff.	Yes.
3 How do you know he'd buy them?	Graff?  Because I worked for him.
4 You haven't talked to him.	No.  What do you mean?  Have I talked to him about this?

1 Yes.  It is, George.  Yes.  It's a big decision.  And it's a big reward.  It's a big reward.  For one night's work.  But it's got to be tonight.	What?
2 What?  What?  The leads.	You have to steal the leads tonight?
3 That's right, the guys are moving them downtown.  After the thirtieth. Murray and Mitch.  After the contest.	You're, you're saying so you have to go in there tonight and...
4 You...	I'm sorry?
5 You.

1 I, you know, they should be insured.	What do you care...?

1 Will you excuse...	Where did Moss...?  I...
2 Will you excuse us please?	Uh, uh, did he go to the restaurant?  I...I... 

1 What?	That they're going to be upset.
2 That's right.  You want to go out today...?

1 Fuck insured.  You owe me a car.	Please don't leave.  I'm going to talk to you.  What's your name?
2 Are you talking to me?

1 Shelly...	...and what is that, John?  What? Bad luck.  That's all it is.  I pray in your life you will never find it runs in streaks.  That's what it does, that's all it's doing. Streaks.  I pray it misses you. That's all I want to say.
2 What about the other two?	What two?
3 Four.  You had four leads.  One kicked out, one the judge, you say...	...you want to see the court records?  John?  Eh?  You want to go down...
4 ...no...	...do you want to go downtown...?
5 ...no...	...then...
6 ...I only...	...then what is this "you say" shit, what is that?  What is that...?
7 All that I'm saying...

1 What are we going to say?	No.  You're right.  That's for later.  We'll talk in a month. What have you got?  I want two sits. Tonight.
2 I'm not sure I have two.	I saw the board.  You've got four...
3 I've got Roma.  Then I've got Moss...	Bullshit.  They ain't been in the office yet.  Give 'em some stiff. We have a deal or not?  Eh?  Two sits.  The Des Plaines.  Both of 'em, six and ten, you can do it...six and ten...eight and eleven, I don't give a shit, you set 'em up?  Alright?  The two sits in Des Plaines.
4 Alright.	Good.  Now we're talking.

1 How could I tell 'em your sale?  Eh? I don't have a tel...I'll tell 'em your sale when they bring in the leads.  Alright?  Shelly.  Alright? We had a little... You closed a deal.  You made a good sale.  Fine.	It's better than a good sale.  It's a...
2 Look: I have a lot of things on my mind, they're coming in, alright, they're very upset, I'm trying to make some sense...	All that I'm telling you: that one thing you can tell them it's a remarkable sale.
3 The only thing remarkable is who you made it to.	What does that fucking mean?
4 That if the sale sticks, it will be a miracle.	Why should the sale not stick? Hey, fuck you.  That's what I'm saying.  You have no idea of your job.  A man's his job and you're fucked at yours.  You hear what I'm saying to you?  Your "end of month board..." You can't run an office. I don't care.  You don't know what it is, you don't have the sense, you don't have the balls.  You ever been on a sit?  Ever?  Has this cocksucker ever been...you ever sit down with a cust...
5 I were you, I'd calm down, Shelly.

1 What?	You've got a big mouth, and now I'm going to show you an even bigger one. 

1 "You do get the..."  Huh?  Huh?	Fuck is that supposed to mean?
2 "You do get the opportunity...You get them.  As I do, as anyone does..."	Ricky?...That I don't care they stole the contracts?

1 Fuck you, Dave...	"You have to believe in yourself... you"--look--"alright...?"

1 You're sure?	Go ahead.
2 Well, Ray was eating at one of his company's men's home in France...the man's French, isn't he?	No, his wife is.
3 Ah.  Ah, his wife is.  Ray: what time do you have...?	Twelve-fifteen.
4 Oh!  My God...I've got to get you on the plane!	Didn't I say I was taking the two o'...
5 No.  You said the one.  That's why you said we couldn't talk till Kenilworth.	Oh, my God, you're right!  I'm on the one...  Well, let's scoot...

1 I've got to talk to you.	Jim!  What are you doing here?  Jim Lingk, D. Ray Morton...

1 I'm very sorry, Jimmy.  I apologize to you.	It's not me, it's my wife.
2 What is?	I told you.
3 Tell me again.

1 Fuckin' asshole.	What, they beat you with a rubber bat?
2 Cop couldn't find his dick two hands and a map.  Anyone talks to this guy's an asshole...	You going to turn State's?
3 Fuck you, Ricky.  I ain't going out today.  I'm going home.  I'm going home because nothing's accomplished here...Anyone talks to this guy is...

1 They didn't get the contracts.	Did they...
2 They got, listen to me...	The...

1 ...I wouldn't worry about it.	Well I'm going to worry about it, and so are you, so shut up and listen.  I GET HIS ACTION.  My stuff is mine, whatever he gets for himself, I'm talking half.  You put me in with him.

1 What took so long?	She couldn't decide.

1 Goddamn bitch.	Relax, Freddie honey.  Come dance with me.

1 Ten to one shot, you said.  Ten to one shot in my favor, and I lose.	Get a good night's sleep.  We got a new suit, new shirt, new tie, and I'm going to shave you myself. Tomorrow we want you to look respectable for fifty million of your fellow Americans.
2 My life won't be worth a nickel after tomorrow.	We have a special home for you for the rest of your life.  Nobody gets near you.  You're not going any place.
3 Yeah, some deal I made.

1 Mikey, why would they ever hit poor old Frankie Five-Angels?  I loved that ole sonuvabitch.  I remember when he was just a 'button,' when we were kids.  We used to put bedsheets on our heads, you know, like we were ghosts.  An' ole Frankie come peek into our room, we'd jump up, and he'd always pretend like he was really scared. You remember?	It was hard to have him killed.
2 You?  What do you mean you, I thought...	It was hard to have him killed.
3 You?  What do you mean you, I thought...	It was Frankie tried to have me hit.
4 No.  I mean, are you sure?	You know otherwise, Freddie?
5 Me?  NO, no, I don't know anything. Fellas!  You're all falling asleep. We got to see Superman.

1 The 'patrone' is here.	Chi?
2 Roberto.  Who owns the 'rat-holes.'

1 Rocco!	I know.  I went down to the Barrett house.  But she's gone.  They drove her and the kids to North Tahoe airport.
2 Goddamn it, where were you?	I was in my house.  Willy tried, but it would have taken some strong-arm to stop her, and he figured you wouldn't want that.

1 Did the boy get something from me for Christmas?	I took care of it.
2 What was it, so I'll know.	A little care he can ride in with an electric motor.

1 We've never sent this much with one courier.	Your plans are a little different this time.  You skip Miami, and go straight to Geneva.  It's to be deposited to this number.  And it's got to be there by Monday morning, no slip-up.

1 There's thirty grand worth of paid off markers -- I never owed that much.	Our mistake.  But what does it matter; it was our money.  We don't even expect thanks.
2 You paid off thirty grand I never owed.	We'll keep it quiet; the people who know are trustworthy...the Committee needn't find out.
3 And what's the price of their not finding out.	Simple.  Be friendly like us.  Not hostile.
4 Thanks...friend.

1 I had no idea...	I wanted to see you before you went back to Nevada.  Also, the children - Michael, they're here.
2 Where?	In a minute.  They're outside with Esther.  I'm very happy for you... I suppose I knew that you're simply too smart for anyone ever to beat you.
3 Why don't you sit down?	I'm not going to stay long; I can't.
4 There are a lot of things I want to talk to you about.  Things I've been thinking about -- changes I want to make.	I think it's too late for changes, Michael.  I promised myself I wouldn't talk about it and I've gone and spoiled it.
5 Why too late?	Tell me, Michael.  What really happened with Pentangeli?
6 His brother came to help him.	I didn't even know he had a brother. And where is he now?
7 On a plane back to Sicily.	And that's all he had to do.  Just show his face.
8 That's all.  You see, in Sicily, in the old days... there was only one legitimate reason to kill a blood relative... only one.  IF he was a traitor.	You would have killed his brother?
9 Kay, you've got it wrong.  That kind of thing's all over, I promised you.  This was between the two brothers.  Years ago Frankie had a young girlfriend; he called her his co-wife.  That was his joke, but he meant it.  He wouldn't divorce his wife... because she was a great cook.  He said he girlfriend made a spaghetti sauce once and it was so terrible he knew he could never marry her.  He set her up in a house in Jersey.  She had to be faithful... and she had to have kids. And she did, two, a boy and a girl. He had her checked out and watched so she couldn't cheat... but the girl couldn't stand that kind of life.  She begged him to let her go. He did.  He gave her money and made her give up the kids.  Then Frankie took them to Italy, and had them brought up by his brother Vincenzo. Where he knew they'd by safe.

1 If only I could live to see it, kid; to be there with you.  How beautifully we've done it, step by step.  Here, protected, free to make our profits without the Justice Department, the FBI; ninety miles away in partnership with a friendly government.  Ninety miles, just a small step, looking for a man who desperately wants to be President of the United States, and having the cash to make it possible.	You'll be there to see it; you'll be there.

1 They asked him to sign paper to take down the markers; but he got mad; told them to wait until he was finished.	Let him gamble.
2 Okay.  You know he doesn't have that kind of money.

1 Senator Geary, I speak to you as a businessman who has made a large investment in your state.  I have made that state my home; plan to raise my children here.  The license fee from the Gambling Commission costs one thousand dollars; why would I ever consider paying more?	I'm going to squeeze you, Corleone, because I don't like you; I don't like the kind of man you are.  I despise your masquerade, and the dishonest way you pose yourself and your fucking family.

1 Here is the six month's increase in advance.  You needn't speak to her about it, she's a proud woman.  See me again in another six months. But of course, you'll let her keep her dog.	Like hell!  And who the hell are you to give me orders.  Watch your manners or you'll be on your Sicilian ass in the street there.

1 What's that mean?	It means it's too cold to go swimming.  And I don't mean the water.
2 I wasn't going to try anything.	Yeah, and I'm never going to smoke another cigarette.

1 No.  You are a guest now.  You go in the living room.	That's okay, Hanna.  I'm more comfortable in here.  It is Hanna, isn't it?

1 Good morning.	Mornin'.
2 My name is Whale.  This is my house.	Nice place.
3 And your name is --?	Boone.  Clayton Boone.
4 I couldn't help but notice your tattoo.  That phrase?  Death Before Dishonor.  What does it mean?	Just that I was in the Marines.
5 The Marines.  Good for you.  You must have served in Korea.

1 All right then.  Sure.  I could use the extra dough.	Excellent.  We'll have a most interesting time.

1 How are you, Mr. Boone?  So glad you are free for lunch.	All right, I guess.
2 I assume you worked up an appetite with your labor.

1 Oh dear.  I <u>have</u> made you nervous.	I'm fine.  I'd just rather keep it on.
2 Suppose we unbutton the top and pull it down around your shoulders? Two buttons.  Is that so much to ask?  Just two little buttons.

1 The extras are in their places. Now we need the star.  Wouldn't you like to get in the pool?	You first.
2 Oh no.  I never swim.

1 Good afternoon, Clayton.	Do I look okay?

1 It's not like her.	Just a night out.  Sounds like she can't say no to her daughter.
2 Certainly you have better things to do than babysit an old man?	Good.  Let's get dry.

1 You know what he did when I called him?  He laughed.  He laughed so hard he practically burst a blood vessel.  Said it was a good lesson for me.  Not to try to fill his shoes.	I'm very sorry.
2 Them's the breaks, right?  No war stories for this pup.	That's where you're wrong, Clayton. You've just told one.  A very good story indeed.

1 Just take off the fucking mask!	Relax, Clayton.  I can't hear you. I can't hear a word.

1 I liked it.  You learn stuff listening to old-timers.	You ever hear of this Whale fellow?

1 She tells me you haven't been sleeping well.	It's the ridiculous pills they prescribe.  If I take them, I spend the next day stupid as a stone. If I don't, my mind seems to go off in a hundred directions at once --
2 Then take the pills.	I wanted to be alert for your visit today.  Especially since I saw so little of you in the hospital.

1 Uh-oh.  The way you look at me, James.  What have you done this time?	Bring a mirror.  Let the Bride feast upon her visage.
2 Boris?  Do I look a fright?

1 Which ones?  I bring them all.	Luminal.

1 Who was that at the door?	A visitor.

1 Yes?	Your father was a schoolmaster?
2 Of course.  I attended Eton -- it wouldn't do for a master's son to attend where his father taught.  I was to go up to Oxford but the war broke out and I never made it.  The Great War, you know.  You had a Good War, but we had a great one.

1 Just like going swimming, isn't it?	Maybe you'd like a swim when we're through.  I never swim myself, so the pool tends to go to waste.
2 Okay.  "Frankenstein."  Tell me everything.	Righto.  Let me see.

1 What are you doing here?	Is there someplace we can talk?

1 Jesus, man ... What'd you do?	My version of "take this job and shove it..."
2 Are you crazy? You throw down with The Carpenter? You got a grudge against your life?

1 I don't want them hurt. Any of 'em...	"don't want" the Dodgers to lose or the summer to end. But we don't get to choose these things...

1 I know you --	You know my back -
2 You want to come along quiet?	How's Atley -- ?
3 Leg's all banged-up. He made a stupid play ... He'll limp around the yard up at Folsom. But Astricky will be there to take care of him. With their priors, they're looking at a serious bounce --	Let them go --
4 How's that?	Let them go. And I'll leave ...
5 You'll leave -- ?	You don't have anything on me. A misdee auto-theft. I got no record. I'll be out in three days, and back at it. Or you let them go, and I give you my word. I'm gone. And without the ringleader ... Your tee-times have just grown exponentially...
6 I don't golf...

1 I want you gone, Randall. Settle your affairs. Make it right with those you love. Hell, take 'em with you. But I want you out of here. Out of here for good this time ...	Consider me gone, Detective --
2 I'll catch you later, Randall --	Double-meaning intended --
3 You betcha --

1 Diane 1.	Very good. Think you can get in without waking her up -- ?
2 Yeah.	That's an after-market alarm. Can't just cut her wires ...

1 No. That was Higgins ....	Jonathan Quayle Higgins ...

1 Jesus. The whole damn thing's loaded.	one minute -- !

1 Have you seen him?	No.
2 oh.	Atley Jackson came to see me ...
3 Atley Jackson. How is that one? How's the leg... ?

1 Breakfast brunch -- ?	Yes, sir -

1 It's good to see ya, man. You changed your look -	You, too

1 What happened to you?	What?

1 Too early to tell. Nervous?	Nah.
2 That's strange. I'm nervous. Donny's nervous. Everyone's nervous. But not you...	I dunno. Whatever will be will be...
3 That's a good attitude, Kip. For everything but stealing cars ...

1 Thirteen down ... Thirty-seven to go ...	No problem -

1 Jim Rockford. ROCKFORD FILES.	For real?

1 What the hell are you doing -- ?	If you change your mind. We're at Otto's. It's 50 ladies in 24 hours. For The Carpenter. 200 K and Kip's life on the felt. So long now ...

1 No whistles, but a Club You bring a hack -- ?	No. Open her ...

1 Where to -- ?	Kip's not clear yet. We got one more to go --

1 I remember I had a 1964 Buick Opal. worst car ever built. Value job. Everything broke and I-fixed it. A coma car - built to German specs. Plastic gas line. 3 speedometer head. On a quiet night, you could hear it rusting in the garage. But when that car was gone, I missed it. If it came driving back in here right now, there'd be tears and laughter ...	And the moral of that story is -- ?
2 Go to them. They'll be happy to see you ... Ahhh...

1 She's not. Carroll Shelby tweaked the Mustang's High-Performance 289 engine and got it legally rated for the street at 450 horsepower ... But its actual output is closer to 600 ...	So she flies -
2 She soars -

1 You think I don't know? You think I like to keep this inside? But I gotta, or he'll kill the miserable bastard and he'll be there for life. It's disgusting what you have to put up with.	Look at Jeannie's kid.
2 What? What happened?	The oldest one.  He was in an argument. A lousy ten-dollar card game. The kid pulls out a gun. It goes off. The kid gets killed. The grandmother hears it and finds out he's been arrested. She has a heart attack.  She drops dead right on the spot. Now Jeannie's got a husband and son in jail and a mother in the funeral parlor.
3 But he was always a bad kid, that one.	No. Come on. It was the younger one that was the bad one.

1 Here. Take it.  Now I gotta turn my back on you.	Thirty-two hundred bucks. That's what he gave me. Thirty-two hundred bucks for a lifetime. It wouldn't have paid for the coffin.

1 I don't care. Something's going on.	That again.

1 Jimmy's calling every day. It's urgent.	What did he say, exactly?
2 At least Jimmy and Mickey want to help. I talk to Mickey every day. That's more than I can say for the rest.	Paul will calm down. You'll see.

1 we're gonna feed the bastard to the lions.	What lions? I'm not going near any lions.
2 We only have to shove'em over the moat.

1 I didn't agree to three points over the vig.- What am I nuts? I didn't need it that much.	What are you gonna do? Fight with him?  He wants his money.

1 Do you realize what we're involved in here now?	I don't care. I need my hat.  I won't go without it.
2 What could I do?  If she insisted, I had to drive her home for her goddamn hat.  I threw the package in the kitchen and went to take her hone.

1 He didn't call?	He's with his friends.
2 What kind of person doesn't call?	He's a grown man. Be doesn't have to call every five minutes.
3 If he was so grown up he'd get you two an apartment.	Don't bring that up. You're the one who wanted us here.
4 Look. He's got the whole house in an uproar.

1 --Yah, restructurin' the amount of retards they had workin' for them.	Fuck you, you fat fuck.
2 Least I work for a livin'.  Why'd you get fired?

1 Jesus, that's really bad, did anyone even order a Flyin' Fish?	No, and we got four of 'em.

1 Suck my crank. Fuckin' sheet metal pussy.  So, when are you done with those meetin's?	Week after I'm twenty-one.
2 Are they hookin' you up with a job?	Yeah, sit in a room and do long division for the next fifty years.
3 Yah, but it's better than this shit. At least you'd make some nice bank.	Yeah, be a fuckin' lab rat.
4 It's a way outta here.	What do I want a way outta here for? I want to live here the rest of my life. I want to be your next door neighbor. I want to take out kids to little league together up Foley Field.
5 Look, you're my best friend, so don't take this the wrong way, but in 20 years, if you're livin' next door to me, comin' over watchin' the fuckin' Patriots' games and still workin' construction, I'll fuckin' kill you. And that's not a threat, that's a fact. I'll fuckin' kill you.	Chuckie, what are you talkin'...
6 Listen, you got somethin' that none of us have.	Why is it always this? I owe it to myself? What if I don't want to?
7 Fuck you. You owe it to me. Tomorrow I'm gonna wake up and I'll be fifty and I'll still be doin' this. And that's all right 'cause I'm gonna make a run at it. But you, you're sittin' on a winning lottery ticket and you're too much of a pussy to cash it in. And that's bullshit 'cause I'd do anything to have what you got! And so would any of these guys. It'd be a fuckin' insult to us if you're still here in twenty years.	You don't know that.
8 Let me tell you what I do know. Every day I come by to pick you up, and we go out drinkin' or whatever and we have a few laughs. But you know what the best part of my day is? The ten seconds before I knock on the door 'cause I let myself think I might get there, and you'd be gone. I'd knock on the door and you wouldn't be there. You just left.

1 I guess so.	What? No. This is my mother's house. I don't live with my mother. I just stop by, help out. I'm good like that.
2 Is this a bad time?	She'll live.  If she starts yelling again I might have to run in real quick and beat her with the stick again but...
3 Okay.	Let's take a walk. EXT. CHUCKIE'S STREET -- DAY

1 Would you shut the fuck up! I know what you ordered, I was there!	So why don't you give me my sandwhich?
2 What do you mean "your sandwhich?" I bought it.	Yah, all right...
3 How much money you got?	I told you, I just got change.
4 Well give me your fuckin' change and we'll put your fuckin' sandwhich on lay-away.	Why you gotta be an asshole Chuckie?
5 I think you should establish a good line of credit.

1 What's up guys?	Why don't you beat off at your house?
2 I don't have a VCR at my house.

1 To tell you the truth, I wasn't there much. The class was rather elementary.	Elementary? Oh, I don't doubt that it was. I remember the class, it was just between recess and lunch.

1 Well, if something was stolen, I should know about it.	No, no. Nothing like that. I just need his name. TERRY I can't give you his name unless you have a complaint.
2 Please, I'm a professor here and it's very important.	Well, he didn't show up for work today...

1 Get out, Will.	Okay...don't forget to get another therapist for next week.
2 That's enough.

1 Yes.	Listen, I'll be nearby so, if you need some help, or you get stuck again, don't be afraid to give me a call.
2 Thank you, Will. I'll do that.

1 Yeah.	He was alive over a hundred years ago. He was Indian. Dots, not feathers...

1 He married his cousin.	Who?
2 Einstein. Had two marriages, both train-wrecks. The guy never saw his kids, one of whom, I think, ended up in an asylum--

1 I called Mel Weintraub this morning, to check for availability.	What's the point?
2 What do you want to do?	There is somebody...
3 Who is he?	He was my roommate in college.

1 I might understand that.	Do you find it hard to hide the fact that you're gay?
2 What?	C'mon, I read your book. I talked to you. It's just something I know to be true.
3 That's very presumptuous.	Buddy, two seconds ago you were ready to give me a jump.
4 Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I'm married and I have two children.	I'm sure you do. You probably got a real nice house, nice car -- your book's a best seller.
5 You're getting defensive, Will.	Look, man. I don't care if you're putting from the rough. There are solid arguments that some of the greatest people in history were gay; Alexander the Great, Caeser, Shakespeare, Oscar Wilde, Napoleon, Gertrude Stein, not to mention Danny Terrio, not many straight men can dance like that.
6 Who is "Danny Terrio?"	If you wanna hit "Ramrod," take your shot. Take some pride in it. You go to church? So fuckin' what, God loves you. I mean, Christ. A guy as well known as you? By the time you put your disguise on and skulk out of the house Sunday nights you probably look like "Inspector Cluseau."

1 So what's with this place? You have a swan fetish? Is this something you'd like to talk about?	I was thinking about what you said to me the other day, about my painting. I stayed up half the night thinking about it and then something occured to me and I fell into a deep peaceful sleep and haven't thought about you since. You know what occurred to me?
2 No.	You're just a boy. You don't have the faintest idea what you're talking about.
3 Why thank you.	You've never been out of Boston.
4 No.	So if I asked you about art you could give me the skinny on every art book ever written...Michelangelo? You know a lot about him I bet. Life's work, criticisms, political aspirations. But you couldn't tell me what it smells like in the Sistine Chapel. You've never stood there and looked up at that beautiful ceiling. And if I asked you about women I'm sure you could give me a syllabus of your personal favorites, and maybe you've been laid a few times too. But you couldn't tell me how it feels to wake up next to a woman and be truly happy. If I asked you about war you could refer me to a bevy of fictional and non-fictional material, but you've never been in one. You've never held your best friend's head in your lap and watched him draw his last breath, looking to you for help. And if I asked you about love I'd get a sonnet, but you've never looked at a woman and been truly vulnerable. Known that someone could kill you with a look. That someone could rescue you from grief. That God had put an angel on Earth just for you. And you wouldn't know how it felt to be her angel. To have the love be there for her forever. Through anything, through cancer. You wouldn't know about sleeping sitting up in a hospital room for two months holding her hand and not leaving because the doctors could see in your eyes that the term "visiting hours" didn't apply to you. And you wouldn't know about real loss, because that only occurs when you lose something you love more than yourself, and you've never dared to love anything that much. I look at you and I don't see an intelligent confident man, I don't see a peer, and I don't see my equal. I see a boy. Nobody could possibly understand you, right Will? Yet you presume to know so much about me because of a painting you saw. You must know everything about me. You're an orphan, right?

1 They're all dead.	Not to me, they're not.
2 But you can't give back to them, Will.	Not without a heater and some serious smelling salts, no...
3 That's what I'm saying, Will. You'll never have that kind of relationship in a world where you're afraid to take the first step because all you're seeing are the negative things that might happen ten miles down the road.	Oh, what? You're going to take the professor's side on this?
4 Don't give me you line of shit.	I didn't want the job.
5 It's not about that job. I'm not saying you should work for the government. But, you could do anything you want. And there are people who work their whole lives layin' brick so their kids have a chance at the kind of opportunity you have. What do you want to do?	I didn't ask for this.
6 Nobody gets what they ask for, Will. That's a cop-out.	Why is it a cop-out? I don't see anythin' wrong with layin' brick, that's somebody's home I'm buildin'. Or fixin' somebody's car, somebody's gonna get to work the next day 'cause of me. There's honor in that.
7 You're right, Will. Any man who takes a forty minute train ride so those college kids can come in in the morning and their floors will be clean and their trash cans will be empty is an honorable man.

1 No. Thank you.	Does this violate the patient/doctor relationship?
2 Only if you grab my ass.

1 Oh, you will?	No...I was hoping to get a kiss.
2 Then why don't we just get it out of the way.

1 You men are shameful. If you're not thinking of your weiner then you're acting on its behalf.	Then on behalf of my weiner, I'd like to ask for an advance.

1 Take care.	Goodbye.

1 Ain't you gonna look back, Ma?--give the ol' place a last look?	We're goin' to California, ain't we? Awright then, let's *go* to California.
2 That don't sound like you, Ma. You never was like that before.	I never had my house pushed over before. I never had my fambly stuck out on the road. I never had to lose... ever'thing I had in life.

1 Maybe the road's out.	I don't know what these cops got to do with it but I don't like it.  An' these here are our own people, all of 'em. I don't like this.

1 House 25. Number's on the door.	Okay, mister. Whatcha payin'?
2 Two and a half cents.	Two an' a half! Say, mister, a man can't make his dinner on that.
3 Take it or leave it. There's 200 men coming from the South that'll be glad to get it.	But--but how we gonna eat?
4 Look, I didn't set the price. I'm just working here. If you want it, take it. If you don't, turn right around and beat it.	Which way is House 25?

1 This is Muley Graves.  You remember the preacher, don't you?	I ain't no preacher anymore.
2 All right, you remember the *man* then.

1 Can't tell if you hear it or not. You hear it, Tom?	I hear it. I think they's some guys comin' this way, lots of 'em. We better get outa here.

1 You people got a lotta nerve.	What you mean?
2 Crossin' the desert in a jalopy like this.	You been acrost?
3 Sure, plenty, but not in no wreck like this.	If we broke down maybe somebody'd give us a han'.
4 Well, maybe. But I'd hate to be doin' it. Takes more nerve than I got.	It don't take no nerve to do somep'n when there ain't nothin' else you can do. 

1 How 'bout Granma?	Take her with you!

1 Anybody ask anything?	No'm.
2 Stand by the door.

1 Know where we're a-goin'?	Don't matter. Just got to go--an' keep a-goin', till we get plenty a distance away from here.

1 She shore don't look prosperous. Want to go somewheres else?	On a gallon a gas?  Let's set up the tent. Maybe I can fix us up some stew.

1 She's gettin' prettier, Ma.	Girl with a baby *always* gets prettier.

1 What was the use. He was right. There wasn't a thing in the world I could do about it.	But it don't seem possible--kicked off like that!
2 The rest of my fambly set out for the west--there wasn't nothin' to eat--but I couldn't leave. Somepin' wouldn't let me. So now I just wander around. Sleep wherever I am. I used to tell myself I was lookin' out for things, so when they come back ever'thing would be all right. But I knowed that wan't true. There ain't nothin' to look out for. And ain't nobody comin' back. They're gone-- and me, I'm just an 'ol graveyard ghost--that's all in the world I am.

1 Here we go!	California, here we come!

1 But what does *that* prove?	Look at 'em! Same yella han'bill-- 800 pickers wanted. Awright, this man wants 800 men. So he prints up 5,000 a them han'bills an' maybe 20,000 people sees 'em. An' maybe two-three thousan' starts movin, wes' account a this han'bill. Two- three thousan' folks that's crazy with worry headin' out for 800 jobs! Does that make sense?

1 Now you done it! You busted it!	I never--

1 Bob. Bob Destephano.	What?
2 I'm Dan. Dan Koretzky.	Computer guy.
3 Yeah... Hey, I saw you at your dad's dealership the other day.	I sell BMW's. What do you do?
4 Not much, actually. My software company just went public so I'm just... hanging out, really.

1 I just play my own collection.	It's nice to see you again.

1 Hello...?	This night, this reunion will be an important step in our relationship.
2 You're fucking psycho.	Don't rush to judgement until all the facts are in.

1 ...About five years now.	Get the fuck outta here.
2 Seriously, when I left, I joined the Army and took the service exam. They found my psych results fit a certain profile. A certain "Moral flexibility" would be the best way to describe it... I was loaned out to a CIA- sponsored program. It's called "mechanical operations." We sort of found each other...	You're a government spook?

1 Go to your reunion, Martin. See those people and discover what they mean to you. Try not to kill anybody for a few days, see how you feel.	If I get antsy I'll kill a few small animals.

1 I want two eggs poached, hash brown well-done. English muffin for the bread. And a coffee.	Whole-grain pancakes. And an egg- white omelette.

1 Sometimes. I'm in divorce, mainly. Some property. Some personal injury.	Those all seem kind of related...

1 Looks like someone keeps trying to do our job for us.	If he does our job, he's our job.
2 I get it.

1 What's it look like?	It's fine.
2 You haven't looked at the dossier.	I've looked at it.

1 God it's great to see you.	You too.

1 Why not?	So what are you doing with your life now, son?
2 I'm a professional killer.	That's good.

1 You know, we're branding here tomorrow. If you two want to come by to watch or give a hand, you're welcome.	Branding?  I haven't branded in years.

1 Are you shy, Mr. Booker?	Just polite. Well, maybe you'd like to try riding again, some time before you go home.

1 Everything under control?	Not really. I'd forgotten how long it's been since I've done this. And I couldn't get any Parmesan cheese.
2 Just make yourself comfortable.	I am comfortable.
3 Ha, ha... all right, well, uh I guess you can bring out the pasta.

1 Then what have we been doing? I mean what was the point?	The point was to love each other.
2 Why?

1 You should call your dad before it gets too late.	I already did.  This morning. When you went running.
2 Oh. You didn't tell me.	I didn't know I had to.
3 You don't.

1 Did you ask him to come visit?	You already did.
2 Did he mention it?	Yeah, he's going to think about it. You want me to pack for you?

1 Listen, if... if there's a part of you as parent that... that takes pride in your child -- that, you can look at them and see something you've accomplished as well... if that's wrong, then I'm sorry.  But it wasn't my intention. I don't push for me. I do it for you... So you don't waste half your life feeling like you don't know where you belong.	Yeah, well, you've done a great job.

1 Oh, I miss you. You look beautiful.	So do you.
2 How's everything?	Good.
3 Hi.

1 Okay. We'll see you later then.	Yeah. Bye.

1 You can hardly get your arms around me. How depressing. You're so early.	I had to excuse myself from a meeting. It's ridiculous. I kept thinking about the baby... you... and, I swear, I was going to start bawling right into my briefs.
2 Aw... that's so sweet.	I love you.
3 Do you? Do you really?

1 So, how are you doing in Marlboro country? Is the magazine complaining at all?	Yeah, but nothing I can't handle. Lucy tells me she thinks Gottchalks's plotting, but what else is new.
2 When are you coming home?	You know, I just asked that myself tonight. He doesn't know.
3 Well then... maybe I will take some time... come visit.	Okay.

1 I have so much to tell you.	You want to take a walk with me?
2 Where to?	I don't know. Let's just go and... we'll see...

1 Where does this go, Diane?	Oh, you can just set up on the dining table. I have to rearrange my shelves tomorrow.

1 Is there anything you need? I'm going food-shopping.	Well, I am going to go after lunch.
2 No, no, I'll go -- just give me a list.

1 Mixed salad.	What?
2 I believe women from New York eat mixed salads. Ain't that right, Tom?

1 When you figure on branding?	Weekend after next...

1 Don't you go to school?	Twice a month they give you a day off to work on the ranch.

1 Put the key in and turn it.  The right pedal is gas, the other one's the brake.	I don't know if I can with my leg.
2 Well, there's only one way to find out.  Give it a little gas.

1 My parents are having friends from college over. They're really nice... They have this gorgeous son who wants to be a forest ranger.	Can I come? I'll start a fire...

1 Honey, you all right? Did something fall?	NO!

1 Hey, darlin'.	Hey, Rona. Sorry I'm late.
2 I wouldn't know what to do if you were on time.

1 As you can see, this is just a simple microcassette recorder.   Hook it up to the phone and drop in five bucks in quarters.	Record the tones that the coins make. And hang up and get your money back!
2 And never again have to pay for a service that would be dirt cheap...	...IF it weren't run by a bunch of profiteering gluttons!
3 Remember, hacking is more than just a crime. It's a survival trait!

1 Right.	The sensitive type.

1 Snoop onto them...	...as they snoop onto us.

1 Nonononono. Truce, you guys. Listen, we got a higher purpose here, alright? A wake up call for the Nintendo Generation. We demand free access to data, well, it comes with some responsibility. When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child, but when I became a man I put away childish things.  What... It's Corinthians I, Chapter 13, verse 11, no duh. Come on.	Phreak and Joey are being framed. We need your help to figure out what's on this disc.

1 Dade?	Yeah, mom?
2 What are you doing?	I'm taking over a TV network.
3 Finish up, honey, and get to sleep. And happy birthday.

1 Talk to me.	I got it. But listen, Kate didn't know what's on it. I mean, she came to me to figure it out. She's not the one who planted the virus. You leave her alone.
2 Hey, don't worry, kid. If she's innocent, she'll be fine. Your mommy's safe now, okay?

1 They'll trace you like that  man, cops are gonna find you, they're gonna find you with a smoking gun.	Fucked if I care, man.
2 Look, even if you had the passwords, it'll take you ten minutes to get in, and you've still gotta find the files, man, I mean, the cops will have you in... five minutes.

1 What the hell are you doing?	It's cool, I'm just looking.
2 It's too much machine for you.	Yeah?

1 Well that's great. There goes MIT.	I'll make it up to you!
2 How?	I'll hack the Gibson.

1 You look good in a dress.	You would have looked better.
2 Wanna go for a swim?

1 You're welcome.	What's going on? Let go of me! Stewardess! I'll never fly this airline again!

1 Alright. How about the Master of Disaster, huh?	You're hopeless, man, utterly hopeless.

1 So what are we supposed to do?	Well luckily, you have a gifted and talented security officer. I traced the hacker's call. The secret service picked him up this morning. I'll just search his files for the original virus code, and then I can eliminate it.

1 Rachel! What are you doing here? I thought I was supposed to pick you up?	Jamie needs a Halloween costume.
2 You do? Okay. Go down aisle A. We've got the best costumes in the whole town.

1 Is there another key?	I don't know!

1 How do we look?	You guys always look great.
2 We'll be at the Fallbrooks. The number's next to the phone.	I know, and next to that is the police, hospital, fire, and probably National Guard.

1 I'd assumed Dr. Loomis would be here.  Michael Myers was his patient.	If Loomis read memos he's be here. Fortunately his position is more ceremonial then medical. My hope is that he's either transfer, retire, or die.

1 Sure it does.	I know you miss your parents, its hasn't been that long.
2 It's been eleven months.	Your mother used to baby-sit me when I was your age.  I bet you didn't know that.
3 Your lucky.  I wish she could do the same for me.	Come on Jamie, lets go back to bed.  Come on Sunday.

1 Jamie, wait for me.	This is great Rachel. Come on.

1 Rachel, take your sister upstairs. First door on the right.	Dad, what's going on?
2 Kelly, I want you to close and lock all the downstairs windows.	Why?
3 Just do it.

1 132 to 133 this is 134.	This is 132, over.
2 Ben-uh-I just heard about the station.

1 This is starting to spook me.	Least I'm not alone.

1 It's over.	Yes. Michael Myers is in hell, buried, where he belongs.

1 You're going to be late at the Doyles, Annie.	Huh?

1 I don't see anything.	That man who drove by so fast, the one you yelled at.
2 Subtle, isn't he? Hey creep!

1 Wait a minute here...	If you watch her, I'll CONSIDER talking to Ben Tramer in the morning.
2 Deal. Hey, I thought Paul was grounded.	He was. Old jerko found a way to sneak out. Listen, I'll call you in an hour or so.

1 I can't help it. It just keeps ringing.	And I can't keep you interested?

1 Come on... A skunk could have killed it...	Could have...

1 Hi, Laurie, what's up?	Nothing. I was just sitting down for the first time tonight.
2 Is Annie around?	No. I thought she'd be home by now. She went to pick up Paul.
3 Well, she's totally not here.	They probably stopped off somewhere. Have her call me when she gets back. I've got Lyndsey here and I want to know what time to put her to bed.
4 Okay. Later.	Have a good time.

1 What about the Jack-O-Lantern?	After the movie.
2 What about the rest of my comic books?	After the Jack-O-Lantern.
3 What about the bogyman?	There is no such thing.
4 Richie said he was coming after me tonight.	Do you believe everything that Richie tells you?
5 No...	Tommy, Halloween night is when you play tricks on people and scare them. It's all make believe.

1 Now, I want you to walk to the door, down the stairs and right out the front door.	You're coming with us...
2 Listen to me. I want you to walk down the street to the MacKensie's and knock on their door. You tell them to call the police and send them over here. Do you understand?

1 ...any sister talk?	Mm-mm!

1 That's just --	Look at this.

1 It's French, though.  It really is.	Yeah.
2 It feels like you're in France.

1 We got that idea on that trip to Paris.	Right.
2 Hmm?	Do you remember that summer in France?  Hannah, you had jet lag for six straight weeks.

1 Oh, it's just so romantic.  I just want to put on a long gown...	Yes.
2 ...and open the French doors and go on the balcony --

1 Well, I'm sorry to say you have had a significant drop in the high- decibel range of your right ear.	Really?!

1 Are you excited about becoming a collector? DUSTY Yeah.	Yeah?
2 I got a lot more to learn, though. I really wasn't into art when I was a kid.	Uh-huh.

1 Oh, my goodness!	Oh, Elliot!
2 Hi.	What are you doing here?
3 Well, I'm-I'm looking for a bookstore.	Oh, what, in this section of town?
4 Yes.  Yeah, I-I'm kill--	You're out looking here?
5 Well, yes, I'm killing time.  I have a client near here and I...I'm quite early.	Ohhhh!
6 How about you?	Oh.  Well, I live--
7 Oh, yes!  You live near here, don't you?	Yes, I do.
8 Where are you headed?	Oh, I was just going to my AA meeting. ELLIOT Oh, my goodness.  Well, why do you still go to those?  You never tough alcohol.

1 e.e. cummings.  I'd like to get you this.	Oh, no, I can't let you get me that. That's too much.
2 Oh, oh, yes.  I-I-I-'d like to, uh, uh, very much.	No, I don't think so.
3 I-I read a poem of you and thought of his last week.  A poem of  his and thought of you last--  You'll be fine, though.  Lee walks over to Elliot in the center aisle.  She looks at the book.	Uh, uh, this is great.  I mean, I love e.e. cummings, but I can't let you get this.
4 Yes, I'd...I-I-I'd love, I'd love to get you this.	Well, sure.
5 And-and maybe, um...maybe we could discuss it sometime.

1 They have a very large gay clientele, you know, where I get my teeth cleaned, and...all the hygienists now wear gloves because they're afraid of AIDS.	Oh, right.

1 Your guilt is because you feel the same.	Oh, please, I have to go.  I have to get my teeth cleaned.

1 And you're in love overnight?	I care a great deal about him, yes.
2 Lee...	Ah, it's over!  Elliot, I mean it. It's over!

1 Oh, let's not--I, I don't know what the hell I'm talking about.	Are you angry with me?
2 No!	Do you feel, um...are you disenchanted with our marriage?
3 I didn't say that.	Are you in love with someone else?
4 My God!  Wha-what is this?  The Gestapo?  No.

1 I am... I did slave all day.	And we drink to her, and we all congratulate her on her wonderful accomplishment during this last year...her great success in A Doll's House!

1 Who thinks about such nonsense? Now I'm alive.  When I'm dead, I'll be dead.	I don't understand.  Aren't you frightened?
2 Of what?  I'll be unconscious.	Yeah, I know.  But never to exist again!
3 How do you know?	Well, it certainly doesn't look promising.

1 ...or films you must see or... 	Oh, no, no, no.  He's my sister's husband.  And I think if you gave him half a chance, you'd like him. He's very intelligent.

1 Mickey, Mickey, listen, listen.	You know... 

1 You're just realizing this now?	Well, I don't realize it now, I know it all the time, but, but I managed to stick it in the back of my mind...

1 So how are you?	Oh, me, I'm okay.
2 Do you miss Frederick?	No.
3 I can't believe Elliot and I can't think of someone nice for you to go out with, you know--	How are you?
4 I'm okay.	You know, how's everything?  You doing okay?  How's Frederick?  I mean, Elliot.
5 Y-yeah.

1 How is everything?	Everything's good.  Everything's fine.
2 Yeah?  Yeah?  Okay, kids, you can open the presents now.	Here, you guys.  Open them up.

1 Hannah and I...can't have any children.  Now I-I-I don't want to get into whose fault it--  It's my fault that we can't and- and-and the details are too embarrassing to--	W-w-we-we've decided after a lot of discussion that we-we'd try with artificial insemination.

1 Holly, please.  Don't insult me.	Someday, I'll pay it all back.
2 I know.  H-how much do you need?	Two thousand dollars.

1 Not this Thanksgiving, you know.	Here.  Be careful with those.
2 Maybe at Christmas, New Year's.  If not this New Year's, maybe next New Year's.

1 W-why?  You don't think it's realistic?	No, I didn't, I, that's no.  No, I- I-I, no, I-I just...  hate to see you put yourself in a position where, where you get hurt, you know.  You know, you know how you take...
2 Yeah.

1 Well, that-that's good.  It just, uh...it just seems to me that-that six months or a year, if-if you spent it more productively...	Well-well, like what?

1 Y-you mentioned to me yourself that you and Elliot were having some problems.	Yeah, we're having some problems, but problems that are my business...which I don't see how you could know about in such detail. How does Lee know about these things?  How?  They're private!

1 I'd never do that.	...in a really horrible way.
2 Oh, well, that was a long time ago.	You look wonderful.  You do.  What happened to you?
3 People change...you know.	Well, I hope you've changed.
4 Yeah, I hope you have, too. MICKEY  I hope so for your sake, because, uh, your personality left something to be desired...	Yeah, and for yours.  I'm sure you've changed.
5 ...namely a personality.

1 Oh, God!	I am.  You-you made my day.
2 Oh, wow!	It was just great.  Uh, I was all set...I was set to be bored stiff.
3 Uh, gee.  Would you like to have lunch?  Uh, uh...	I-I would love to talk to you about, uh, that script.  I-I, you know, I think maybe that we could do something with it.
4 Okay, and listen, I would like to hear what made you suddenly decide to drop out of life.	Oh, who cares?
5 Y-you used to-- Oh, no!  Yeah, I care.  You used to be so ambitious and...  God, you really liked it?!

1 Yeah.	Get a garter belt...  Get a garter belt and flirt.
2 Where are the antihistamines?

1 I can't think.	...you don't have to think.
2 We have to talk about <u>money</u>...	I'm on the track of a reward, which...
3 A reward...	I'm going to tell you later....
4 A reward for what?	Some museum director disappeared.
5 And?	They're offering... 
6 ...you haven't <u>found</u> him yet.	<u>What</u> is this, a whorehouse, or are you my <u>wife</u>?
7 You've gone off to America, on your <u>Vacation</u>...	...I was <u>working</u>...
8 ...<u>please</u>...	I <u>swear</u> to you...
9 ...and I want to talk to you about your <u>promotion</u>..	Yes?  My <u>promotion</u>...?
10 I want to talk to you about your <u>salary</u>. Because I can't...

1 Then you tell me, then.	You want me to solve all your problems tonight...?
2 I feel...  I feel they're Out to <u>Get</u> Me...	And who is "they?"
3 ...they're sending me.  Out to get Shot.  Hounding me.... they're... 	...the whole world's out to get you...
4 How crazy is that.	Well, you wanna shoot <u>back</u>, it give you a big <u>target</u>...
5 How <u>crazy</u> is that....

1 The identity of the person offering the bounty was never established.	Yes, but we know who it was, and I will tell you, Agent Starling, what you know to be true.  I offered the bounty.  It was illegal, and, worse, it was <u>wrong</u>. And I thank God every day that I did not compound my sinful life by the stain of a murder.  Do you  Agent Starling:  do you know <u>God</u>? 

1 He don't like popcorn.	No.  And...
2 I like Popcorn...	...yes, if you'll, just step <u>away</u>...
3 You give me whatever I want...?	Yes.  You know I will.  That's right.
4 Awright.

1 I know you did what you could.	I'm going to work for your reinstatement...
2 Reinstatement to <u>what</u>?  There ain't nobody there...

1 Give it up, Evelda.	Well, you know <u>my</u> name, honey, but <i>I</i> don't know <u>yours</u>...
2 Give it up.	Hey, you know, I never thought of that...

1 Darling, Dr. Fell.  My wife Madame Pazzi.	Enchante.

1 ...they eat the dummy, sir, they eat the <u>man</u>... I keep them hungry.  When... when do we think this man arrives.	Is it necessary to know?
2 Well, I don't want to starve them too long.  They die.	Oh, no, no.  It won't be <u>that</u> long.

1 Thank you, Cordell.	...but will that satisfy you?
2 Why should <u>you</u> care?	It is not that I care for <u>you</u>--but that I posses an enquiring mind.  What will you <u>do</u> when I am gone?  When you have nothing to occupy your thoughts, save the memory of your own folly, and, more to the point, stupidity.
3 ARE YOU <u>DONE</u>?	<u>Yes</u>.
4 You don't wish to <u>beg</u>...?	Would that add to your <u>mirth</u>?
5 Explain in depth the plan we have for him.  Until tomorrow.

1 Because you're going to help me plan a party.	You're going to <u>do</u> that?
2 I'm going to do it, and you're going to catch the bouquet.	The Multi-Jurisdiction Task Force:  read alphabet soup, for the continued pursuit, and in preparation for the apprehension of the fugitive, Evelda Drumgo.  The man's hazing you.
3 My daddy would say:  accept with glee the things you cannot change.	I'll tell you what:  I should go in there, volunteer to fill up his Female Quota. 
4 Mr. Crawford asked my opinion.  Here we've got a purported x-ray, Dr. Lechter's surgery.  Do we keep it secret, or broadcast it?	Saying what, "Look out for a guy with ten fingers...?"
5 Yeah, that's too Hip for the Room.	You stay offa this Alphabet Soup Detail, all this half-baked, cowboy stuff, till after you get your <u>mind</u> cleared.... you don't wanna go out there a half-step <u>slow</u>...
6 I don't wanna go out there at <u>all</u>...	What do you want to do?  You want to jam up that sonofabitch Krendler.
7 No.  I want to buy a dog. 	What broke <u>you</u> free, Girl?
8 I met a man, and His Troubles Were Greater Than Mine...

1 ...and then, we're going to <u>Greece</u>...	Yes, but the <u>important</u> thing, as I've said...
2 ...get me a cigarette.

1 Tell me why...?	I'm sorry, I don't mean to be impolite. Because, you know, you can't understand.
2 Then tell me.	Well, you know, you know, you know, the <u>point</u> is:  I <u>can't</u> tell you.  Cause you haven't <u>been</u> there.  You haven't <u>done it</u>. And that's all there <u>is</u>.
3 ...and to have <u>done</u> it, means, can mean to accept, not only <u>danger</u>, but <u>betrayal</u>...?	....that's right.
4 ..and <u>humiliation</u>?  What is this new job they've...?	No.  That's right.  That's all part of it.
5 Then, that being so, why is today special?  Why have you come back to see me?  Is it that new file they gave you?	I don't <u>think</u> so.
6 Then what brings you back?	I don't know.  Do <u>you</u> know...?
7 Yes.  I think I <u>do</u>.  I think it is a phrase you used with that woman.  You told her you were an <u>orphan</u>.  You <u>used</u>, to your mind, your most private fears.	...no...
8 ...you called up memories of your <u>father</u> to...	...no...
9 ...<u>barter</u> with her.  To appeal to her, and you feel that...	No, I don't <u>think</u> so...
10 It is <u>you</u> who have betrayed...	...no.
11 Your father.  It is not <u>they</u>, who...	Well, no...  That's... I appreciate your <u>help</u>, but... 

1 Yes, then, you're saying that you <u>haven't</u> bid upon these drawings.	I have not, I would <u>not</u>.  For life  life goes on Starling.  And, wait, wait, I wish to <u>talk</u> to you... I'm...    One moment.  I was <u>afflicted</u>, do you see, but my affliction was not in my meeting with your Dr. Lechter.  I was <u>afflicted</u> before. Before.  Do you see?  In my arrogance. Do not  Do not curse God when you are humiliated.  Listen to me: <u>embrace</u> it, and you embrace <u>life</u>.... <u>Listen</u>, and you hear the word of <u>God</u>...

1 Summer would have been a lot less without you. You're a true friend, Donald.	Was there a night that I got really drunk and declared that I never loved anyone as much as I loved you?
2 No.	That's good. I wouldn't have wanted to embarrass myself.

1 Talia, don't go!	Wha-at?  What is it?
2 Everything.

1 Are we allowed to start hating "Wendy" yet..."Gee Wichita, I guess mosquitoes have always liked me."	You and Wichita go to school together, right?  Have you two ever...
2 That would be a No.	That wants to be a Yes.

1 ...sorry...	This is not the way it was supposed to-- I was going to start writing a children's book using input from all-- I don't even like smoking!

1 Yes!  God yes!  I would tell her that I love her!  To not let anyone take away her dreams..!	You should grab her and shake her                           ] and tell her it's a goddamn war out                         ] there.

You brought me out here to punish me.
2 Nobody really changes at summer camp. They merely find out who they are and become it more than ever.  You can't be helped, Wichita. I'm not sure you can be punished, either. But let's find out...	How do you mean?                                            ]

1 Todd was out there blocking the                             ] entrance. You would have been proud                         ] of me...My suit of armor is starting to come off. Not all of it, but enough to walk around...	And you'll be happy to know I'm going to drop my Snow White and the Seventy Dwarves act...Not all of it, but...
2 I was thinking...if we could mesh my way of thinking with your way                            ] of thinking, we could really do some                        ] great counseling.

Don't say I love you, too. I hate that--"love you, too."
3 I know what you mean. But it doesn't put me in too great a position...	Don't worry, you...

1 I'm still on anti-biotics, I really                         ] shouldn't be caffeining...Gosh, I've had a lot of daydreams about losing my virginity. Never one like this. For one, I wasn't a mutant. Secondly, I...What are you thinking?	I'm just thinking I'm glad I broke up with everyone I ever went out with.  The swelling is gonna go down, right?

1 Hey, you're not settling for the two shots are you? Knock me out girl. It's the only way.	It's not my style, okay?
2 Nice guys finish last. I should know.

1 So what was the first week of Spring Vacation withdrawl like?	I don't know, it was okay, I guess.

1 I was talking with someone!	Color me impressed. I thought you grew out of Betty Finn.

1 You were nothing before you met me! You were playing Barbies with Betty Finn! You were a Brownie, you were a Bluebird, you were a Girl Scout Cookie! I got you into a Remington Party! What's my thanks? It's on the hallway carpet. I get paid in puke!	Lick it up, baby. Lick. It. Up.
2 Monday morning, you're history. I'll tell everyone about tonight. Transfer to Washington. Transfer to Jefferson. No one at Westerburg's going to let you play their reindeer games.

1 TEENAGE SUICIDE; DON'T DO IT!	Some teenybopper rag says Big Fun wants to play a Prom. It could be Westerburg's if we can get everyone's John Hancock.

1 Heather, why can't you just be a friend? Why are you such a MegaBitch?	Because I can be! The same fucking cheek, goddamnit! Why are you pulling my dick? Do you think, do you really think, if Betty Finn's fairy godmother made <u>her</u> Cool, she'd still act nice and hang with her dweebette friends? No way! Uh-Uh!

1 Shit.	So did you call people to tell them how to get to the studio tonight?

1 That was my first game of Strip Croquet, you know. I thank you.	You're welcome. It's a lot more interesting than just flinging off your clothes and boning away on the neighbor's swing set.

1 What are we going to tell the cops? "Fuck it if she can't take a joke, Sarge."	Stop kidding around. I'm going to have to send my S.A.T. scores to San Quentin instead of Stanford.
2 I'm just a little freaked, all right?  You got what you wanted, you know.	It's one thing to want somebody out of your life. It's another thing to serve them a wake-up cup of Drano.

1 These are Ich Luge bullets. My grandfather snared a shitload of them in W.W. Two. They're like tranquilizers only they break the surface of the skin, enough to cause blood, but not any real harm.	So it looks like the person's been shot and killed when they're really just unconscious and bleeding.

1 Football season's over, Veronica. Kurt and Ram had nothing to offer the school but date-rapes and A.I.D.S. jokes.	Sure. Can we make an ice run before the funeral?

1 It's over, J.D.  Over!	I don't get it! You were wrong! I was right! Strength, damnit! Come back!

1 You really fucked me up, Veronica.	I thought I...you..
2 You've got power, Veronica. Power I didn't think you had. The slate is clean.

1 You two....	Greate pate, but I'm going to have to motor if I want to be ready for the funeral tomorrow.

1 The world wants winners, I guess. Not people stained with loserness.	Stained with loserness. Oh, I like it. Can I use that. It'd be dynamite on interoffice memoranda.
2 It's all yours, Heather. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go throw up.	Sure. Ciao.

1 waves a pair of new socks around. The family laughing and talking. Pauline is not participating. She is leaning back, looking morose. HONORA looks at her with concern.	Is it hurting, dear?

1 If you think for one minute that your father and I will tolerate this sort of behaviour, you've got another thing coming! You're only 14!!! You're a child! What on earth's the matter with you, Yvonne? You know what can happen with boys . . . Don't you have any self-respect?	sighs.
2 Can I go now?	grabs Pauline by the shoulders.

1 I wouldn't want my private business being discussed with a complete stranger!	Oh, no . . . Mummy's awfully good at it.

1 I think I'm dying . . .	Don't . . . please! Please, don't!

1 I shall call him Diello.	You're such an incredible woman.
2 I couldn't have done it without you, Charles.

1 But that's not true! I've got one.	I need my sodding parents' consent.

1 Well? What do you say Trevor? Que pasa?	Let me see. Oh yeah. My head feels like it's going through a meat grinder. I'm not sure if I'm dreaming or...
2 That `poor me' attitude doesn't suit you Trevor. Listen, I don't mean to sound like Pollyanna but things could be worse. There's one good thing about coming so near to the end of ones life. Everything is new and exciting, like your seeing it for the first time. You might see things a litlle differently from now on.	Your insight is enlightening.
3 No wisdom, no insight, no plan.

1 We startred off to be. She was, I guess I was. I just sort of....butchered up the relationship somehow.  Bad choice of words.	I understand, I think. Other women?
2 Yeah. It's like I was a different guy then I am today. I can't remember that guy. I see these women, they think I'm someone else, and I'm not that guy anymore. I'm not sure who Kristy knew.	You were unfaithful, it sounds like your confessing.
3 I did more then that.

1 GWEN?	I crap you not. She was all over me yesterday in the break room. And she was a total machine last night too.
2 You were supposed to have a date with Gwen last night? GWEN DEARDON? The supervisor?	Serious as a heart attack my friend. I think she literally fucked me brains out.

1 You could say that.	Zero's a number right?
2 As in one minus one equals zero yes. Where are you going with this?	How many zeros was your wife worth?

1 What isn't wrong? Why are you doing this anyway?	I'm... I'm doing a very special thing here. And you can't even ... respond?

1 Trevor I've decided we have got to agree on a name before we reach my mother's. This poor kid's going to be starting preschool as student x if we don't make up our minds. So, I've been thinking, what about Daisy?	It's perfect.

1 Please Larry. Pretend you like me and humor me.	Seeing you were her sole benefactor, and I'm the executive of the will, Kirsty's entire estate would have to be donated to the city.
2 Hello? City? Cops? It's a fucking conspiracy!	Pardon my glibness Trevor but you sound like a raving lunatic. The next time you seek counsel it should be of the psychiatric type. You're obviously on the verge of some nervous collapse.
3 Thanks for your concern Larry. And fuck you too.

1 I don't know what I'm doing here. I'm not even Catholic. I just had to tell somebody. It's like, ever since my wife died I don't know what I've actually done or what I've imagined. But I do know if one tenth of what's happening to me is reality... I've done some really awful things in my life. Things that I've... I guess I've blocked out...	What things do you think you've done?
2 Wow. Let's see. So many sins so little time. For starters I was responsible for the death my wife who by the way was carrying my unborn child. That was so I could collect her eight million dollar estate. I think I killed several women I was having mindless sex with behind her back.

1 Last week...	The car accident? Any of this ringing a bell?

1 And you pulled people out? You're...  a hero.	Nah, I fucked it up.  I was tryin' to impress this kid, don't ask me why.  I was gonna rescue his old man, but I couldn't find the poor bastard.  He musta blew up.  I got the hell outta there.  I didn't have the nerve to face the kid.
2 A lotta people wouldn't have tried. It was pretty brave even trying...	Try stupid.

1 You got those people out of the plane, LaPlante, not me.	You <u>woulda</u> gone in there, you wouldn'ta thought twice...  Trust me on that, that's the kinda guy you are.  For a guy like me, it's a momentary loss of sanity.  I wasn't thinking clearly.  Listen, I'm no hero, John.  I just want some dough and maybe a little favor. How much didja spend already on all that do-gooder bullshit?  You didn't spend it <u>all</u> didja?
2 Well, I donated a lot to different causes, uh... La...	Bernie.  Call me Bernie.
3 --but there's a lot of it still left, uh, Bernie.  Almost half.

1 I seen on the TV where that do-gooder asshole's gonna go visit sick kids at three-thirty.  Children's Hospital, on the double.	You mean John Bubber?

1 He waited for you three hours!	You are not gonna believe this, Evelyn!  Absolutely fantastic!  I'm on my way --
2 I am so tired of your bullshit, Bernie.	Ev, it's not my fault!  I'm trying to tell you this incredible --
3 It's never your fault, Bernie! Never ever!  You screwed up my life, now you're gonna screw up Joey's life, but you're never gonna accept responsibility for anyth--	Is he here, your friend.  The fireman?
4 He had an emergency call... a <u>real</u> emergency.	Why doncha let me in so we don't wake everybody in the neighborhood?

1 Are you gonna take me somewhere next weekend?	I'm working on that.  It's just I got some business problems and... whatsa matter?

1 Uh, if you could, just, uh, support, uh, a small airfield...	It's been sometime since, uh, I received any, uh, of that kind of, uh... attention.  A couple of... years.

1 Did you get it?  Jesus, did I say that?	Yeah, I got it.  Sports training. You learn to follow the ball.  How about you do a wrap-up from up here?  I'll pan off that skyscraper over there, find you here, then reveal the drop.

1 We're piecing together different accounts and...	A "mystery guy!"  "Not a passenger." Who?

1 She wants to quit?	She can't quit.

1 I haven't won it yet.  I notice you've got me scheduled on a flight back an hour after the ceremony.	An hour after...!  Deak, for Heaven's sake!  Let's give her a night in New York City.  We'll put her and her boyfriend up at a good hotel...

1 So, <u>Neil</u>.  How's it goin'?	Okay.
2 I'm Bernard, by the way.  Those are cool Reeboks, Neil.  They're real new, aren't they?

1 Things are beginning to come to a head.  I can feel it.  And I want everything to be perfect.	Who doesn't?
2 I've cultivated her interests so that now we have even more in common than ever.	Well, now, don't go creating some artificial environment for yourself.
3 Oh no -- I mean, she's genuinely made me more fulfilled in many ways -- and I hope eventually to be able to teach her a few things, too.  What I mean is, I guess I'm still waiting for just that right -- synthesis between us -- where everything will be understood between us without even the need for words.	It's not going to happen unless you make it happen, my friend. You're going to have to assert yourself a little bit more.  <u>Show</u> your affection.
4 Yeah, maybe you're right. Everything else is just an excuse. I'm treating the situation with kid gloves because I'm afraid of losing her.	<u>Ask</u> her how she feels.
5 I should.	You have to put yourself out there a bit more.
6 Right.	Because life isn't about playing it safe.  Life is about taking risks.

1 About what?	About us.
2 Mr. Sykes, I think you should go home.

1 You've done a really great job with the house.  It's great!	Yeah.  There's still a lot I want to do.  It's not quite... the kids aren't really settled in yet. Even the dog has been terribly high-strung and whines a lot since we've been here.  Look, he hasn't even come in for his food today.
2 So you don't have anything concrete?	No, I told you.  A whiff of perfume on his shirt.
3 Have you just plain asked him?	I've asked him what's wrong.
4 And?	The same thing -- his business pressures, the whole move and everything.  He's frantic about nailing this new job, worried about screwing over his present boss.
5 I'm sure that's all it is, honey. Maybe you both just need a vacation.	I've tried to get him to agree to one.  I just -- I don't know... I'm getting such weird vibes lately.
6 Don't drive yourself crazy.  It's probably nothing.

1 Honey, do you want some hot chocolate?	No, thanks, Mom -- I'll go up to bed now.
2 Do you want me to come up and tuck you in?	That's okay, Mom.

1 I hear things in this house,	All new houses have noises.
2 How long does it have to be a new house?	One day before we know it it'll be an old house and we'll be old in it -- and I'll still be paying for it.
3 Neil's still having a bad time at school.  I feel terrible seeing him so upset all the time.	He's made some friends, hasn't he?

1 The floor has a nice shine to it.  Oh God -- we have twenty-two messages on the machine.	Did she water this plant?  It looks a little bent out of shape.

1 I was having a bad day -- I lost that job, I was dependent on other people, I was let down --	There's always an excuse, isn't there?
2 I think it's time I came home now.	That's not a decision for you to make on your own.

1 Dad, we can't decide unless Rudolf gets to look too!	Would you mind if Rudolf had a look too?

1 Do you see a man?	No.
2 No man!  <u>Go to your room</u>.

1 Lieutenant?	What?  Who are you?  What do you want?
2 My name is Jennifer Hillman.  I'm an archaeologist.  I read in the paper about the murder yesterday and I thought I should come talk to you.	Talk to me about what?

1 For Chrissake!  Gimme a break.  The guy disappears for seven years and as soon as he comes back it starts again.	I see your point, Bedsoe, but I have to look at this from the law's point of view.  There's something missing here.  It's something I'm sure you've come across many times in your career.  It's called evidence.  Get me a murder weapon with his fingerprints on it.  Find me an eye witness.  Dig up a motive.  Until then we don't have a case against him.

1 Most people would show some sign of fear with a gun in their face.	Most people are afraid of death.

1 Do you not hear the wind in the trees?  The songs of the birds.  The horses breath?  There is a whole world around you. Alive.  Living.  Feel it -- become part of it.  Live your life, Highlander.  It's going to be a long one.	That is what bothers me.
2 I see.  You don't care about life anymore.

1 Well?	It's done.

1 Aye?	Where do you go when your mind drifts?
2 Different places.	The past?
3 Sometimes.	Why is it you never talk to me about Scotland -- your life there.
4 Because it's the past -- and things that are in the past are best left there.

1 You're hurt.	I'll be fine.
2 What's going on?  Why did he call you Macleod?	Because it's my name.
3 Then who's Russell Nash?	I don't know anymore.

1 I'm just trying to place you.	I've lived all over the world.

1 He's in there!	Get out.

1 It flatters me you remember, old one. It's been what... two hundred years?	It's not been long enough.  What witchcraft is this?

1 Would you care for some water, Conner?	Aye -- that I would, lass.

1 Mike!  Mike, can you hear me?	I think he's dead!
2 Don't shout, Larry.  I'm three feet away.

1 You should warn them, Sonny.	<u>Fuck</u> them!  Now get your head in the game, Phil--we have to handle this.

1 Mars, watch the cops!  Kevin!  Watch the back of the house!	You won't die if you let me help.
2 Bullshit!	But if you stay in this house, I can promise you this --
3 <u>Shut up!  Shut up and get on the floor</u>!	You can't imagine the fucking you're going to get.

1 Everyone knows what we look like, Dennis. We won't be able to hide.	Jesus, first Mars, now you.  You two need anti-depressants.

1 We're cool.	Let me speak to Mr. Smith.  I want to hear it from him.
2 Fuck you.  I'm running this shit.  You talk to me.	How about your two friends?  You don't have a man dying in there, do you?
3 They're fine.

1 You've been in there a long time. What're you waiting for?	Would you be in a hurry to go to prison for the rest of your life?
2 I'd be trying to get the best deal that I could.	Maybe that's what I'm doing.  Can I reach in my pocket, show you something?

1 The cops are comin'!	I got the gasoline --
2 We don't have time!

1 L.A. County Sheriffs are inbound from a bank robbery in Pico Rivera.	Give me an ETA.
2 An hour, tops.  Might be sooner.

1 I'll kill you!  You won't get the other disk!	If you shoot me, he'll kill your daughter.  Do you want to lose both of them?

1 You leave that gun alone!	Shh, they'll hear you!
2 Better than you getting killed!  Don't touch that gun!  Daddy says --

1 You gotta pee?	I don't see why you can't just lock me in.  It's not like I can go anywhere.
2 Either I'm going to tie you or Mars will tie you.  Which do you want?

1 I'm Jeff Talley, the Bristo chief of police.  So far as we know, your children are okay.	Chief Talley is the one who got you out.
2 I need to talk to him.  Alone.

1 Chief, base.	Go.
2 I couldn't find Jane.  She wasn't at the restaurant.	You have her cell number?
3 She didn't answer.	They might be at the house.  Keep trying and let me know.  I'm going to be here a little while longer.

1 I want to know what in hell you're doing.	I'm looking for you.  I need your tactical unit.
2 I'm not stupid!  You can't get out of here fast enough, then you take back command; you agree to wait on Smith, then you risk everything in a stupid stunt to get him out --	Don't question me, Captain!  This is <u>my</u> crime scene!
3 -- then when you get him, you damn near assault the man in the ambulance!  <u>What</u> <u>is going on</u>?

1 The kids are in here!	Where's the office?
2 Help me, goddamnit, we can get the disks later!

1 Yeah!  Here's a name.  This is somebody's personal tax --	Who is it?
2 Charles G. Benza.  They're coming!

1 When this phone rings, you answer.  It will be me.  I'll tell you what to do. When I have what I want, you get your family.	You want . . . Marlon and Al.
2 I have people in York Estates right under your nose.  If you do <u>anything</u> except what I'm telling you, you'll get Jane and Amanda back in the mail.  We clear on that?	These disks . . . where are they?
3 Smith will know.

1 Paul...  ...I have to talk to you.	I'll be back.

1 Ten.	And four children?
2 I'll give you a hundred thousand francs for all of them.

1 They fired a rocket at us.	Yes. Where are the Rwandan police?
2 I ran out of bribes. Bizimungu took them away.	That explains it. I'm sorry to tell you this but we've heard rumors the Militia are getting ready to storm the hotel.
3 Will you protect us.	I can't, I don't have the men.

1 Please, General, I will give you money, whiskey.	You said you had no whiskey.
2 Please, I have money. They're driving into an ambush, it's on the radio.

1 You lie.	If you do not help me, you will stay on that list.
2 I committed no war crimes.	Who will tell them? You need me to tell how you helped the hotel. The others who have gone, they blame you for all their misfortune. They say you led the massacres.
3 I led no massacres.	You think they will believe you?
4 You will tell them the truth.	I will do nothing unless you help me now.

1 You fucking see that!	Oh my God!

1 Where are we going, sir?	For supplies, you drive.
2 The fog is too heavy, sir.	Just drive, Gregoire.

1 Who did you call?	Call, sir?
2 Don't lie to me. What's your name?	Rusesabagina. Paul Rusesabagina.
3 I will remember that name.  Let's go.

1 This time the Militia will kill us.	They will surely kill us here. It's over here. We have to take the chance.

1 The president has been murdered.	Murdered! By whom?

1 Has Roger spoken yet?	No, Odette says he's in shock.
2 How can we help him.	He needs to be in a safe place.  Have you heard from Mr. Garindi?
3 Give him time.

1 Please, Paul, why do we have to go to the roof?	It's alright. This is the only place I can find some peace.

1 We have to have a plan.	What sort of plan?
2 Our children cannot see us die first. If the Militia comes, you must hurry up to the roof. I will meet you there.	Please do not talk like this.
3 We have to. If I do not come, you must take them all by the hands and jump.

1 Where are the receptionists? Where's Gregoire?	He has taken the presidential suite.
2 What! Paul storms off.

1 All. What do you mean all?	The staff, the guests.
2 The staff and guests! How many?	Now we have eight hundred guests and one hundred staff. I have ten minutes left.

1 It's not, baby. Just a matter of minutes now, before somebody pulls the trigger --	-- but nobody has yet, Donald. They just haven't been brought to that breaking point. They have to believe proof-positive that their lives are in danger.
2 How much more do they need than your death at his hands?	But they didn't see it happen, they still have doubts. What we need is another body, and Steven's bloody hands right next to it!
3 And how the hell are we going to do that?	Okay: this may sound crazy, but --

1 More the merrier.	No. I'm going back to try and find Ms. Marr. If she's hurt, I'll tend to her. Dead, then I'm coming back for him.

1 Where is it??	I don't know!!

1 Shouldn't somebody like, stand guard or something -- just in case?	I'll stay, if it'll ease your mind.
2 You sure? You'll be alright by yourself?

1 Hey! Where'd you guys go?	Left, goddamnit!

1 Right here, Mr. Pritchett. As well as five other bona fide, bank drafts for one million dollars each. Made out to cash.	And we get this money when?
2 The second the sun hits tomorrow morning. Assuming you have stayed the entire night - and you're still alive, of course. Any other questions?

1 Three steps forward -- I want to get up there.	Why?
2 This whole place can't be wired to just one circuit --

1 I think we should have taken a right back there.	Back where?

1 What --	-- was that??

1 Melissa Margaret Marr, Celebrity.	Eddie Moses, Communications Attache -- which translated from ancient bullshit means: I work for a Messenger service.

1 What are you talking about?	Must be getting old, Stevie -- you're repeating yourself -- this is the exact same set-up you used for the Son-Of-Sam Hunt back in '94.  Girlie, open up that casket there and see what you find.

1 You think this is fucking funny??	No, no, it's just --
2 -- well, here's a better one: you're fired.	What?
3 And here's your goddamn severance!

1 -- it's getting older by the second. Mr. Price, if I could just please have --	Sorry, Pritchett, here you go.

1 This is all maybe getting a little too strange --	-- I wouldn't worry, Ms. Jenzen: the unexplainable will probably explain herself before too long. In the meantime, let's all relax, have a drink, the evening's young --

1 Then tell me, please -- help me...!	Don't think so. Stay the fuck back.
2 Please! I need your help.	Not even for a million dollars, Mr. Price.

1 Uh, excuse me? Don't think I'm not having the time of my life watching this train wreck that's your marriage -- but this isn't what I had in mind... I want to know that we can get out of here if we need to.	Believe me, we need to.
2 Pritchett, this "lockdown" thing -- it's gotta have like a master control -- you know machinery, gears, whatever -- somewhere in this place?	The basement -- but, believe me, you don't want to go down there.
3 No, you don't want to go down there. I am going down there. And I'm going to find <u><b>reverse</b></u> on this thing and floor it.	You'll never find it, it's a maze down there.
4 Well, that leaves you with two options then, doesn't it: either show me where and maybe we get out of here -- or it's spend-the-night-sleep-tight.

1 I feel something.  It's faint, but...it's there...	You say you saw some activity here?

1 Did you find her?!	No!

1 Can I do it again tonight?	We'll have every leprechaun in Ireland here honey.

1 H-how long will it take?	Go to your room!  Now!

1 We're here Aubrey!  Look, don't be afraid.  We want you to come back to us...	It's dark!  I can't breathe!

1 Well maybe we don't need to remind her of it.  She has a lot more to adjust to...new friends, new schools...it would be good if she had a stable family environment.	You didn't think much about that before.
2 Look, I thought we were all right on this, Maura.  It's over.  You know that.

1 What is it?	It was in the cellar.  Weird.
2 Well something just happened to the power upstairs... Maura heads off and shakes her head, troubled by the event -

1 Aubrey!	Aubrey!

1 You're bleeding.	I'm all right...

1 You must be a Londrigan.	Yes, I am.

1 She's coming back.  Keep talking!	Come back to us honey!

1 I said nothing before, for fear you wouldn't believe me.  I've been here before to cast evil from this house.  The amulet is a guard against evil, blessed in countless rituals.   It is an ancient ceremony of the early Catholic church, a ceremony whose secrets are all but lost.	So what does that have to do with Aubrey!  Where is she!
2 We must return it, if you want your daughter back.	What are you getting at!
3 I said nothing before, for fear you wouldn't believe me.  I've exorcised forces from this house. Eliza knew, she was there.  It wants another soul, the one we've taken away. We must weaken it!

1 Where did you find this?	It was nailed to the cellar wall.
2 I see some faint lettering.  It appears to be the...Runic alphabet?	Runic?

1 Wait ... wait.  You ... you have to help me.  I don't understand.  Am I dreaming this?	You have to help me.  You will understand.  And no, you're not dreaming.  Do you know where we are?
2 It's ... I don't know.  First World War, right?	Correct.  The fields of France.  And many dead flowers ... Oh.  Forgive me. My name was Spenser.  Elliott Spenser. Captain.

1 Look, lady!  I told you!  It's not my problem!  I was just there!	Where?

1 Sorry.  It was my father's.  It's temperamental.	It's okay.  It's just someone burned me once.

1 I was downtown looking for a ... a friend.  A guy I know.  Anyway, there was this store.  Like real old?  Lotsa weird shit in there.  I saw this statue. Pillar.  Thing.  I knew he'd love it. You've seen the club.	Would you know this store again?
2 Sure.  Why?	It's Saturday morning.  Let's go shopping.

1 Yes really.	Wow.  Thank you.
2 No.  Thank you.

1 How do we start?	It has already begun.

1 That was beautiful.	I laughed, I cried.

1 Alex, did you know this ape was going to be here...	Sure.  That's why his meatballs are made out of marinated Chuck Wagon.

1 You got about five minutes and change.	5:32.  "Swinging on a Star."
2 You know they invented something while you were inside.  Called a watch.

1 Rio, Alex?  After all they've done to...Hey, these tickets are for Moscow!	Damn travel agency.  That Kremlin thing is in Moscow, isn't it?

1 Alex, are you....	I can't believe you didn't notice. My weight.  I lost ten pounds in Rome
2 You're a reed, man.  I gotta get Anna.  Hang in there...

1 Lucky for us, the Da Vinci is located in a wing of the Kremlin that they used to throw the Miss Ukraine pageant and stuff.  It'll have the least number of guards....	As for our plan of action, anybody'd be insane to go in from the ground floor...

1 My God, that was bold of you, you didn't have to do that...	Forget about it--it was nothing-- anybody would have done the same thing--It's an impulse...
2 No, I meant you didn't have to tackle me and rip my dress.  A polite push, perhaps?  A clear shout of "watch out, Anna" would have done nicely...	Excuse me, Milady.  I would have flown over and carried you up to a pink cloud, but I left my cape at the cleaners.

1 What have you been doing?	Uh....old badminton injury.

1 Hey, don't take your disguise so seriously.	Uh, yeah.  Guess I'm a wee bit nervous.  I'm sorry I could only score clergy passports.
2 Fits my new image.  A thief for the masses.  This is one job I'm not going to feel guilty about enjoying.  Gum.

1 You're hitting Rutherford's Auction House.  Easy as my brother's wife.  Directions are in the bag.  Just open the seventh floor safe and take out the thingie...	Or you cut off my thingie. Directions even your brother would understand.

1 Alchemy!  Is the business term of the 90's, my man!  Minerva read about it in an airline magazine about four years ago.  I dumped some lira into research... Shazam, we come across a diary by one of Da Vinci's apprentices detailing La Machine de Oro, the gold machine for those at home, and the rest is about to become history.  Money isn't everything, gold is.  Fuck blue chip stocks!  Fuck T-bills! Fuck Junk Bonds!  I got the real deal!  Money will always be paper but gold will always be gold!	Market crashes.  Bomb drops. Greenhouse effect affects.  We'll still be the richest, most powerful people in the world.  In 1992, Europe is coming together to become one business superpower.  It's one party we'd love to poop.
2 Well, that said, the last ingredient in the recipe is in, get this, you're gonna die, the Kremlin.

1 The auction house, asshole.  One night's work and you're free like no ex-con's ever been.  No checking in with a shrink, no community service teaching retards how to play air hockey. It's a great deal, I can't lie.	The only thing you can't do is get sex for free.  I know I was in prison for like basically the 80's, but, call me daffy, aren't you supposed to <u>stop</u> me from committing crimes.  You know, Book-em-Dano, Call-for-backup, Give-a-Hoot-Don't-Pollute.

1 Cool, isn't it?  Weight, feel, mal1eability, they're all but identical.  On the periodic chart of elements, they're but one proton apart.  Great minds worked for centuries to turn worthless into priceless.	Alchemy.

1 Don't I know you...	You just might.  I'm the guy who tricked you into robbing a government installation and then had you sent to prison for it.  At the time, I was bald with a beard, no moustache, and I had a different nose, so if you don't recognize me, I won't be offended.
2 Bastard, you're going to need another nose!

1 The Daddy-Oh!	The Circle-o'-Gaiety!

1 I'm tellin' ya, this guy's just the patsy and I'm gonna find out what for. There's a real story, Smitty, some kind of plot, a setup, a cabal, a -- oh, and say, did I tell ya?!	He didn't offer you money.
2 A sawbuck!	Ten dollars? Let's grab a highball!
3 On Norville Barnes!

1 You're from Muncie?!	Why yes, do you know it?

1 Norville... there's something I have to tell you. You see, I'm not really a secretary.	I know that, Amy.
2 ...You do?	I understand that you're not very skilled yet in the secretarial arts. I'm not that skilled as president. Oh sure, I put up a big front --  -- not that everyone's buying it.
3 I believe in you, Norville -- At least I believe in your... intentions --	Oh, I don't blame them, really. I guess I have sort of made a mess of things. These folks have to protect their investment. Most of them are very nice people --
4 Norville, you can't trust people here like you did in Muncie...

1 ...Oh, it's you! Lookin' for a nitwit to buy your lunch?!	Oh Norville, I --

1 Just got hired today!	Terrific.
2 Ya know, entry level!	Tell me about it.
3 I got big ideas, though!	I'm sure you do.
4 For instance, take a look at this sweet baby...

1 Say, buddy! Who's the most liquid businessman on the street?	Well, I --
2 Waring Hudsucker! Na-ha-ha-ha-ha! Say, buddy! When is the sidewalk fully dressed? When it's 'wearing' Hudsucker! Na-ha-ha-ha!

1 -- Uh... Buzz, I'm sorry, I -- Buzz, you gotta forgive me! I shouldn't a fired you, I didn't know what I was doing! I was a little funny in the head, I --	Aw, buddy, I don't care about that.

1 I'm brushing up on my French with the most charming man, Pierre of Fifth Avenue. Do you know him?	I haven't had --
2 Sidney and I are planning a trip to Paris and points continental -- Aren't we, dear?

1 My God! The Bumstead contracts!!	Oh my God, sir!

1 ...Congratulations, kid, you've really outdone yourself. Reinvented the wheel. I'm going to recommend to the Board that we proceed immediately with this, uh... with the, uh... that the dingus be mass-produced with all deliberate speed. Of course, as president of the company the ultimate decision is yours.	Well... I'm for it...

1 Maybe he's wise.	He don't look wise.

1 I really intended going out to the Fort and meeting you long before this, Miss Connell.  I'm Mrs. Rand -- Wesley's mother.	Oh, Mrs. Rand --
2 Come, come, don't tell me how sorry you are that I should meet you this way.  I'm even a little glad that Wesley's difficulty brought us together.

1 She can never be cured?	I've never heard of a cure.
2 Is this disease common in the tropics?	Fortunately, not.  This is my first experience with it as a physician. But I have seen half-witted field hands -- whom the other peasants call Zombies.  I am sure they suffer from a similar destruction of spinal nerves as the result of high fever.

1 Perhaps you ought to get on to the mill.	It'll wait.

1 No, Wes.	Jessica was never any good for Paul.  You will be, you are.  And Mother -- seeing Jessica day after day -- never able to escape, never able to forget.  Please, Betsy -- it's only merciful.

1 Good morning, Miss Connell.	Good morning.

1 I still can't believe it Paul -- that you wouldn't say a word in your own defense.	I have no defense.  So far as I know -- it is true.
2 You can't believe that.  You don't know what viciousness it would take to drive a person mad.  You're not vicious or cruel, Paul.	How do you know I'm not?  I was cruel to Jessica.  When I got to know her -- when I found out how empty and ungenerous she was, there was something about her -- something smooth and false -- that made we want to hurt her.
3 I can understand that.  Everyone feels that way about someone.	No.  It's not just how I felt toward Jessica.  I've been cruel to even you.

1 An accident at the mill?	No -- it's about Mrs. Holland.  A result of our discussion the other day, I'm afraid.
2 What about her?	In view of all the circumstances, the commissioner has decided on a legal investigation.
3 Investigation of what?	Of the nature of Mrs. Holland's illness.  And, of course, the events which led up to it.
4 In other words, I'm on trial.	I did everything I could to forestall this, Paul.  I don't think there's any question of your innocence in the matter.  But there's been too much talk.  The thing's out of hand.
5 Maybe it's better this way, Mother. I'm glad you're going home, Betsy -- you'll be out of the mess.

1 Benjie!	Clair, George Clair! What the hell brings you to New Canaan?
2 Well, it's the funniest thing. I've been talking to some investors -- a little outside venture, you understand, between you and me -- about a scheme to manufacture a new Styrofoam packaging. Little peanut like pieces that can really keep an item free from trauma during shipping. Miraculous. Anyway, it turns out the genius behind the whole project is your neighbor, Jim Williams. How about that!	Well, hey, isn't that a one-in-a million coincidence. A real dreamer, Jim Williams, eh?
3 Darned right. Look here, Benj, whaddya make of this sequel to The Godfather? You think it's gonna work?	Don't see how. I think the public's had its fill of this gangster stuff. No, trust me -- disaster pics. And air hockey.
4 Yeah, good.

1 You all right there?	Oh. Sure, I -- Did you remember to pick up the cranberry sauce?
2 Um, yes.

1 You've...	In the car.
2 Oh, yeah. Yeah, we'll be right back, Dot.

1 About?	Well, the whole gamut. Facts of life and all. Some fatherly advice, because, I tell you, there's things happening that you're probably old enough... well...  For example, on the self-abuse front -- now this is important - it's not advisable to do it in the shower -- it wastes water and electricity and because we all expect you to be doing it there in any case -- and, um, not onto the linen, and not on your sister's underwear or any clothing belonging to your mother --

1 A prior engagement overcame me.	What?
2 Listen, Benjamin Hood. I have obligations that precede your... from before you showed up. One or two, you know, good-natured encounters, that doesn't mean I'm... I'm not just some toy for you. When I remembered some chores I wanted to get done before the party, I just did them, that's all, because I wanted to do them before I saw Jimmy.	Jimmy? Jimmy? I don't know how to take this. And what do you mean, Jimmy? I thought you said you and your husband --
3 How you take it isn't all that interesting to me, Benjamin. I'm sorry --	I just can't believe you could be so --

1 He's probably been waiting all night at the station.	C'mon.

1 And to think -- they met at a key party of all things.	A key party?
2 You know, it's a California thing. That scuzzy husband of hers dragged her kicking and screaming to one when they were out in L.A. you know, the men put their car keys in a bowl, and then at the end of the evening the women line up and fish them out and go home with whoever's keys they've got. Anyhow that's how she met this Rod person or whatever his name is and he's left his wife and she's packing for California. Irwin is devastated. It's so ironic.

1 Hi mom.	Hi Wendy.

1 I'm thinking of going back to school.	Social work?
2 How'd you know?	Educated guess.
3 I'm that predictable? No, you don't have to answer that. It's just that with the kids almost grown --	You don't have to apologize. I'm too much of a cynic. You actually seem to be trying to figure things out -- don't mind me.

1 Waste not Master Hood -- that was $20 for the bag.	Man, Francis, you are one drug addled elitist freak, and when the revolution comes I do not want to be lined up with you and shot, 'cause you're fucking ripe for political reeducation, you know, like in the fields.
2 Paul, cancel your mental appointments, baby. What are you, like still stoned from last night?	I gotta get to English class.

1 Come on Paulie, share the wealth. You copped 'em from her mom's stash anyway.	Let's see!

1 Stupid!  Is Wendy Hood your girlfriend?	Who said so?
2 No one.	I don't have a girlfriend.

1 Wow!	Wendy!

1 Sandy, you scared the shit out of me.	What are you doing?
2 Just thought I'd stop by.	Mike's out -- I think he went to Silver Meadow to see if you were hanging around there.
3 Yeah.	Are you his girlfriend?
4 No.

1 Just after Leland Street.	What's that, then?

1 Don't give misdemeanors a bad rap.	But they're so boring.  All small stuff.
2 It's all about the small stuff.  Small lies.  Small mistakes.  Small oversights. People give themselves away in a traffic violation just as much as they do in a murder case.  It's human nature.

1 Duggar called him?	About an hour ago.  Said he was more than happy to cooperate.

1 She left the party early.  Friends said she had a fight with her boyfriend and stormed out.	What time was that?
2 Around twelve-thirty.

1 That's right.	Mrs. Connell found this copy in the house.  It's signed.  Personally.
2 So?	This is a local writer.  Kay had all his books.  I think we should check it out.

1 Weston Dobbs killed an eight year-old boy and left him hanging in the basement like a piece of meat.  You remember that?	You know I remember that.
2 One word to I.A. and he walks.	Maybe not.  We could talk to Buck...
3 No way.	Cut some kind of a deal.  I heard that's what Flynn's doing...
4 Mike Flynn's a dirty cop, Hap!  We are nothing like Mike Flynn.  We did what we needed to do to make sure that son-of- bitch Dobbs paid for what he did.  And every bastard like him.  We say one word about it and every case we ever brought in is going to blow wide open and they'll all walk.  Every last one.  And I am <i>not</i> going to let that happen.  No deals.  No compromises.  No discussions.

1 Will.	There've been other cases.  Where we've changed results.  Pushed witnesses. Manipulated evidence.  But Dobbs.  I wanted Dobbs more than anything.

1 Hey...	Thought you wanted something fun...

1 You gave her gifts.	Yes.
2 Expensive dresses.  A heart necklace.	Yes.
3 Doesn't sound like a mentor to me.	I gave her things she didn't have. Couldn't have.

1 Monstrous.	Yes, and very beautiful.
2 Your lips, they didn't move.	They did, but too fast for you to see them. No magic, just grace and speed.

1 Claudia is dear to me. My... daughter.	Your lover.
2 No, my beloved, my child.	If you say so. You are innocent.
3 I'm not innocent. But I'm afraid. She feels she's in danger from the others.	She is.
4 But why?	I could give you reasons. Her silence. Her youth. It's forbidden to make so young, so helpless, that cannot survive on its own.
5 Then blame the one who made her...	Did you kill this vampire who made you both? Is that why you won't say his name? Santiago thinks you did.
6 We want no quarrel with him.	It's already begun. If you want to save her, send her away.
7 Then I leave too.

1 More.	Yes, cherie, of course you want more. And I'll show you how to get it. You drink from morals, my beauty, but from me? Never again.

1 Oh, Claudia, you've outdone yourself. Where did you find them?	Drunk on brandy wine. A thimblefull. I thought of you when I saw them.
2 We forgive each other then?

1 You see the old woman? That will never happen to you. You'll never grow old. You will never die.	And it means something else too, doesn't it? I shall never, ever grow up.

1 Hush, Claudia, hush now my dear -	Tell me you don't hate me Louis. I did it for you -

1 You know her?	Yes. Should I take her, Louis? Among her dolls? make a doll of her in turn?
2 Come, Claudia...

1 You would leave me for Armand if he beckoned you.	Never.
2 He wants you as you want him. He's been waiting for you. He wants you for a companion. He bides his time that place. he finds them as dull and lifeless as we do.	That's not so.
3 Do you know what his soul said to me without saying a word? When he put me in that trance...	So you felt it too!
4 Let him go, he said. Let him go.

1 Diane!!!!	They are gone, Louis. Death took them. Death which you can now destroy...
2 NO!!!!!

1 Take him.	The crucifix -
2 Forget the crucifix. Take him.

1 The trick is not to think about it. See that one? The widow St. Clair? she had that gorgeous young fop murder her husband. She's perfect for you. Go ahead.	But how do you know?
2 Read her thoughts.	I can't.
3 The dark gift is different for each of us. But one thing is true of everyone. We grow stronger as we go along.

1 Why do you do this Lestat?	I like to do it. I enjoy it. Take you aesthete's taste to purer things. Kill them swiftly if you will, but do it! For now doubt, you are a killer Louis. Ah!

1 You are the devil! You are the instrument of Satan!	That's enough, cherie. Stop before the heart stops.

1 I tried to tell you Louis... that night in Paris... when I first came to you... no-one can refuse the dark gift, Louis... not even you.	I tried...
2 And the more you tried, the more I wanted you... a vampire with your beautiful, suffering human heart. And how you suffered... I need your forgiveness, Louis.	You have it...

1 But why did you tell her?	How could I not? She had to know.
2 And did you lose her? Did she go?	Where would she have gone? She was a child, and beautiful, heartbreaking merciless child. And I had made her that...

1 And the child who did die?	My daughter...

1 I want off this island.	Not possible, I'm afraid. The last ferry left hours ago. And we got a storm coming. There won't be another one for days.

1 I thought you were out of town!	What are you doing in my closet?
2 i just wanted your black pants, but I'm not ready to die for them!

1 Oh!	Hey, sorry...  He's my friend, too. And that ticket is not going to waste.

1 It's okay...He doesn't believe me. That's his right. I'm starting to think I'm crazy, too.	Hey, slow down, turn off the little motor up in there...What do you say we go to the gym and work off a little stress?

1 Be careful, Julie.	I've got to see.

1 I understand something.	It's not like that. It's not you. It's me. My head. I want to go back. I want to be with you. I want to be fine. I want everything to be like it used to be.  It just isn't.

1 I am not crazy, Tyrell. He was right there.	Fine. Show me the body.

1 Just take deep breaths and think of something happy from childhood.	What if I don't have anything happy from childhood...Sorry, I can't relax going five hundred miles an hour, or four thousand, four hundred feet a minute...  Which is over seven hundred feet a second. Imagine hitting something at seven hundred feet a second.
2 Deep breaths --	Fumes build up in the fuel tanks. You can by surface-to-air missiles over the internet. Planes use O-rings...which freeze in tap water. Planes fall from the sky for practically no reason at all.
3 You've got a better chance of getting hit by lightning.	Right. Planes get hit by lightning. They get hit by meteors. They hit other planes.

1 Why are you doing this to me?	Me, me, me. It's always about you. I'm having bad dreams. I can't sleep. I'm not doing well in school. I'm having trouble with my boyfriend.
2 I trusted you.	We had a connection, didn't we? I can tell you one thing, though. Ray didn't trust me. He was right. He's dead, but he was right.

1 Pretty cool bar.	They all start to look the same once you've worked in one.  Am I right, sister?

1 To a great weekend --	Yeah, a great weekend. Forget the weather!

1 Hell, that's worth three, easy. And you got your waiting period.	I'm not waiting...So give me the gun and keep the ring.

1 Where is everybody?	They're all dead...Dead, I tell you.  Ahhhh, we're all deaaaddddd. Tyrellll, joinnnn usss.

1 But the gods played a little trick on me. I was born in Switzerland.	You collect these to sell, abroad?

1 She's right. This is hardly the time to bandy old tales.	I have lived long enough to doubt everything -- which is to say, I believe everything, a little.

1 I'm not sure that it is the plague.	We will know when the next one sickens.  Until then you and I remain here. I will not bring the plague to my troops.
2 In the meantime it would be useless to alarm the others.  Let them think it was a normal  And, perhaps it was - perhaps it was.

1 Where's Thea?	I think she went to bed  I saw her going toward the house

1 I have been troubled about you. I want you to know that my room is just downstairs --  You have only to cry out if you are ill  or frightened.	How kind you are. It is so comforting to know that someone cares.

1 I felt he did not like me.	That should decide it or you --
2 I will let him go. He is dead to me as he is to all my mother's people. I turn my hand against him.

1 I'm a woman -- a lonely woman. I have few friends.	Yes?
2 I have not had a happy life --but that one thing - - that terror which brings me awake out of deep sleep - I want to avoid it.	I don't understand you.
3 I don't want to be buried alive. If I die I want to be sure - quite sure.	If you should fall sick we'll be careful. You need not worry.
4 No, I want more than that. I beg you General, make sure --drive a knife through my heart -- anything.	You ask that of me? You're afraid to live in your coffin. You know what that means?
5 That's superstition. That's something out of old tales -- about the dead who live - I'm talking of something else --cataleptic attacks -- apparent death that is not real.	Never fear -- when you are dead you will remain dead. I will see to it that you do not walk about again. I promise you that. There is another one here who can not die. I will watch you both. Never fear.

1 There is something evil about her.	Oh, now  now look here 
2 I know all you are going to say -I have been saying it to myself, but the thought will not leave my mind. She resembles my wife -there is something about her the way she moves  the way she turns her head.	But that should make you like her.

1 Daughter -- my daughter --	She was born before your wife returned here to die. You never knew.

1 Times are bad, Mr. Potter. A lot of these people are out of work.	Then foreclose!
2 I can't do that. These families have children.

1 What the Sam Hill you yelling for, George?	Don't . . . George?

1 Well, that's the doggonedest thing . . . I haven't heard anything out of that ear since I was a kid. Must have been that jump in the cold water.	Your lip's stopped bleeding, too, George.

1 Yeah, yeah, I know. You told me that. What else are you? What . . . are you a hypnotist?	No, of course not.
2 Well then, why am I seeing all these strange things?	Don't you understand, George? It's because you were not born.
3 Then if I wasn't born, who am I?	You're nobody. You have no identity.

1 Why, yes. This is amazing.	If you ever get your wings, you'll see all by yourself.
2 Oh, wonderful!

1 Thank you very much.	It was his faith and devotion that are responsible for this organization.

1 Well?	Mother . . .
2 Mother? What do you want?

1 Hee-haw!	Hee-haw!

1 Oh, no, Please, don't go out this way, Mr. Bailey.	I'm all right.

1 Mr. Gower, I won't ever tell anyone. I know what you're feeling. I won't ever tell a soul. Hope to die, I won't.	Oh, George.

1 I know it's soon to talk about it.	Oh, now, Pop, I couldn't. I couldn't face being cooped up for the rest of my life in a shabby little office.

1 Two cents worth of shoelaces?	She was here first.

1 Avast, there, Captain Cook! Where you headin'?	Got to see Pop, Uncle Billy.
2 Some other time, George.	It's important.
3 There's a squall in there that's shapin' up into a storm.

1 Those Rockefellers!	Get a tray for these great big important simoleons.
2 We'll save them for seed. A toast!

1 Yes, sir.	Have you notified the police?
2 No, sir. I didn't want the publicity. Harry's homecoming tomorrow . . .

1 I'm not very good at this.	Neither am I.
2 Okay  what can we lose?

1 They're way downtown. They'd be on my side, too.	I'm going to scream!

1 After that, who cares?	That does it  come here.

1 Oh, George, George, George.	Mary! Let me touch you! Oh, you're real!
2 Oh, George, George!	You have no idea what's happened to me.
3 You have no idea what happened . . .

1 Great!  Find one for me.	With butter, if they got any....

1 Don't!	Stop paddling!

1 Putz -- that won't be for hours.	I was counting on hours.

1 But the island!	The Shark.

1 How're we going to do that floating on this garbage...?	Anyone got another set of sails?

1 We got a helluva tide this month.	Could you just keep that crowd back, please?

1 You're too close.  Back off.	Goddamnit, Hendricks, untie the rope there.

1 Is Hooper coming to dinner?	Not till next year.

1 May I have this dance?	Sorry, I'm all booked up...  Come, m'dear.

1 The shark that did this.  It was a shark, wasn't it?	We don't know that, do we?
2 But that's what we're here to find out, right?	You don't tell me my job, and I won't tell you about yours, okay?

1 Mmmm.	MMMmmmorning....

1 Oh, hi -- How was dinner?	Oh, perfect -- a 75 per cent family affair.  Where were you?
2 Santos' place.

1 What is it?  What's the matter?	Mike's out there.

1 Harbor Air, do you read?  Over?	Brody?  This is Patrol Base.

1 The lighthouse is a make-out spot.	Now I really want to see it.
2 You going to fool around with Mike?  Well, I'm not doing anything with him.

1 Did you ever see a dolphin?	Sure.  They like to play.  We may see some today.
2 Great!

1 Take a break for a minute, okay?	Huh?

1 Rich or poor, it's nice to have money.	Figure they split?
2 Happens every season -- someone takes off.  Once we had a schooner for a month while the owners went fox hunting.

1 That's fun!  Let's race for some- thing!	Name it.

1 I don't need you.  Andy's here.	You always go with Andy.
2 How was dive class?

1 You should've been out there.  You should've seen him waving that gun, like a maniac.  There were shots fired!	He thought he had a good reason.

1 I'll need more men to look.	Can't help you, Mike.  Don't have the manpower.
2 We're going to have to cover the entire lagoon.	I know, but you're just going to have to find another way.  So you better start.

1 That macho pompous English --	Don't let him get you.  Just continue your patterns and pretend he's not around.
2 My imagination isn't that good.	Honey, I gotta go.
3 Okay, bye.

1 ... If nothing's wrong, why are we stopping here?	... Electrical connection malfunctioning.
2 You sound like Houston Mission Control.  What the hell does it mean?	That we swim.
3 Swim where?  Out there?  Oh, no, forget it, not me!  You go, I'm staying.	Michael, the sub's dead.
4 Yeah, and so will I be if I start swimming in that blackass jungle.	Okay, stay.  We'll come back for you.

1 Wouldn't this whole thing be a little safer in the daytime?	It's easier to lure sharks at night.
2 Why?  'Cause they're hungrier?

1 Honey, what is it?	Hydrophobia...
2 Michael, take deep breaths.	I have to get out of here.
3 Come on.	I can't take water, Kathryn.
4 Yes, you can.	I can't!  My dad had it, and I don't know if you can inherit it or what, but I got it, and I hate it.  I can't stand it!

1 Are you okay?	I'm  fine.

1 I insist you get rid of that bomb.	Afraid I can't do that.
2 You're supposed to film it, not turn it to hash!	Look, Doctor, this isn't one of your pet porpoises we're after. It's a torpedo of muscle. Murderous expertise!  I've seen bleeding sharks try to eat themselves!  Don't be so concerned about them.  Worry about yourself.

1 We can assume he's back in the water intake passage.	She, Mister Hutton.
2 He.  She.  Let's blow the bitch up!

1 Sean.  Sean, where are you?	Someone's looking for you.

1 Besides that.	I don't know, what else is there?
2 I know!  We can take the gondola ride!	The one that goes underwater?
3 Yes, it's great!	No, Kelly, I don't want to...
4 Come on, it's fun!	Not for me.  I don't go in the water, remember?
5 You're not in the water.  You're in a gondola.	No, think of something else.
6 Sean, this is ridiculous.  You're acting very immature.	I'm not acting!  I don't want to go in it, okay?

1 Back, Kelly.  Lean back!	Ohhhhh shhhhiiiit.

1 How far away is filter number four?	Five hundred yards.
2 You have a man near it?

1 How is he?  Still fighting crime?	Last week he broke up a major counterfeiting ring.  Gang of kids were using slugs in the Pac-Man games.
2 Big bust!  He confiscate their water pistols?	Booked them all at Baskin- Robbins.
3 That's Dad...

1 It has its virtues.  It hasn't fallen down yet....	Watch me, Grandma....

1 What do I think?  I think it's a lovely idea....	Please, Mom.  At least consider it. You should get away.  You shouldn't be alone now....

1 What the hell are we arguing about?	I don't know...You...I don't know.

1 I could use a half-dozen more arms ...I've only got two weeks to get this thing finished....	Do you and Michael ever talk about his work...?  About spending so much time working in the water?
2 Usually it's all he talks about...You mustn't worry....	I can't help it....
3 I used to worry...But you know what happens, you find out that scuba diving's safer than climbing into the bathtub....	I shouldn't interfere...  My mother-in-law is so neat she puts paper under the cuckoo clock....
4 Henny Youngman....	You caught me....
5 You're not interfering, Ellen....

1 What the hell's it doing in warm water anyway...?	What difference does it make?  It's here....

1 Ask the big doctor about his work.  Tough life you Bahamian beach bum... Playing in the water all day....	He heard that.
2 Good.

1 We have to dig it deep so the water will go all the way around...So we can swim to it....	You're silly....

1 I want you to get out of the water....	What?
2 I want you to give up that terrible job.	Come on, Mom, you can't be serious....
3 You're damn right I'm serious....	I'm just getting started....
4 I don't want you in the water anymore....

1 Nothing out of the ordinary....	Once he locked himself in the bathroom and your grandfather had to get the ladder and climb in through the window....

1 You hungry?	No.

1 Depends on where you want to go....	Doesn't matter....

1 Couple of more passes and I'll buy my own airplane.. Hell, maybe my own airline....	You're not going to bet it all....
2 All or nothing.  You want to roll them for me?	No!

1 I can't....	Yes you can....

1 You're going after her in that? You're crazy...It'll take all day in that bathtub....	You got a better idea...?

1 I want you to leave her alone.  I don't want you involving her in....	What's that....?

1 The stuffing came out of the pillow he was wearing....	Feathers all over the place....
2 It was like having snow in the house ...Jesus, I miss them.

1 Office of Naval Research has some money....	Forget it....
2 Money is money....	They put bombs on dolphins....
3 I know a guy who got money from them to study eels....

1 We're out of money, partner.. We wrap it up, write it up and turn it in... How come your heart sounds stronger than mine?  You got two of them...?	We don't write up anything until we're done....
2 Okay.. .we're done, man....	When we got the grant....
3 When I got the grant.....	When I signed on....
4 When I invited you...	We got it together, Jake....
5 Okay...we got it together....	We have at least three months' work left.  We can't write a report...We don't know enough....
6 We've got a rare bird here, Michael. Great whites don't come to the Bahamas.  There's never been one down here before.  I'm not just going to let it swim away.	My name goes on that report.  It's a half-assed job, I don't get my doctorate.  Neither do you....
7 The shark will get it for us.

1 We lost it....	Maybe the gear crapped out....
2 If you hadn't been gassing about Hoagie....	Maybe it's gone....

1 If it works, if we can get it inside the bastard and set it off, it'll shock the hell out of it.  We'll need a slave switch to set it off. Pull the dry cell out of the radio.	Anybody ever tell you you're nuts....

1 Woman has taste....	When he has a pillow over his head....
2 You want to be careful how you talk to me... I'm about to become famous...You should see....

1 No, Sir. I haven't started till Monday. I'm a "tourist."	"Welcome to Eureka."

1 How's the new residence?	O.K.
2 What does that mean?	Not too good in daylight ..
3 C'mon, just shut your eyes until it's painted.  You're gonna love it. This is "God's Country," John.

1 Pig Woman agreed to take a test.	I think I got something - twenty two years old, dark hair - study- ing mathematics -  - Last seen <u>5 weeks ago</u> ..

1 Did he shut you down?	All but .. How <u>you</u> doing?
2 I dunno, I daren't go in there - just about get her wired up, and the fucking mayor walks in - mad as hell - what are we doing fuck- ing with his staff? We should be out chasing major violators ..	I wish he'd tell that to Citrine.

1 Ease off, John ..	<u>I'm sick of this toy town shit</u>.
2 Everything you say sounds reason- able. But there's also a reason- able explanation for the opposite.	Don't give me that! <u>Not another</u> <u>word</u>! When you had the Fat Lady in there, and I asked you if she was lying, you looked me right in the eyes and said <u>yes</u>. So as far as I was concerned, <u>she's ly-</u> <u>ing</u>. And if the King of fucking England had walked in & told me different, I wouldn't have bel- ieved him - because <u>you</u> told me ..

1 Policemen's bodies age at diff- erent rates. Look at me. Gut in its fifties. Balls in their six- ties. And feet in their eighties ..	<u>Hit those wipers, Ross</u>.

1 You're pushing this too hard. It's like you <u>want</u> me to say <u>stop</u>? You must know that's the way this is going, John? There's other work to do, why don't ya ease off a little?	Coz this is a major & we're closer to this bastard than anyone's ever been.
2 Then <u>where's the body</u>? .. Where's the body, and <u>why's he hidden it</u>?	He <u>hasn't</u> hidden it. He never made a hit this far north before, and he never read a weather forecast .. She's probably fifteen feet from the highway, three feet under snow.
3 Have you got a match on the bullet?	No.
4 Have you got a print from the hand?	No, Sir.
5 It could be anyone's hand. Illeg- ally disposed of hospital debris ..	It's <u>her</u> hand. <u>Her</u> scars. <u>Her</u> dog. Her dog's shot. And she's missing.
6 She's <u>not</u> "missing." Did she shout? Did she scream? Did he coerce her? <u>No</u>. She left of her own free will .. And if she gets on a plane and goes to Peru with the prick, she's still not missing. You got no case, John.	If you're not gonna hear me, Chief ..
7 I <u>have</u> heard you. You just don't like hearing <u>me</u>. You got this whole damned thing outta proportion. I don't know what you gotten used to in Los Angeles, but I don't believe there's a Police Chief, <u>in this country</u>, would put a task force together for a body part ..	We have a multiple homicide, Sir ..
8 We have a body part in suspicious circumstances - a tailor's dummy wearing a brassiere - <u>and a bill</u> <u>for seventeen dollars for its wig</u>!

1 Did you find the knife, Sergeant?	No .. But we have a theory ..
2 Kid told me he didn't take it?	Maybe he's lying to you?

1 Yes, Sir.	As she's a member of my staff, may I ask what this is about?
2 Well, apparently, she saw Amber the weekend she left, & was briefly in the room with the guy she left with.	I see .. Well, she's teaching an- other class at four .. I'd apprec- iate it if you don't detain her ..

1 I suppose I'm the worst witness you've ever had?	I gotta admit, you're one of them. Just wish I knew what you meant by a "hollow car?"
2 Well, some cars sound fat and some cars sound thin, and this kind of car sounded "hollow" ..

1 I have to talk to you, Helena.	I know.
2 You know? How do you know?	Coz you hardly said a word since you got here. But you been thinking pretty loud ..

1 What are you doing, Travis?	I been told to take your car in, Sir.
2 Why?	I dunno, Sir. Brought you up a Chevy.

1 Is that Margie?	I'm here, honey. I'm right here.

1 Hey, we're not talking "talk" tonight.	No one's gonna make that Gent. Six months investigation, & the nearest we got, we thought he was a sailor.

1 The coroner wants to know if we can release the derelict?	Ask him.

1 This can't be happening to me.	Jerry!  Do something --

1 Oh Jerry.	You know I didn't ever want to hurt you.

1 Airight.  Enough.  I'm pulling him out of this.  This isn't what I had in mind anyway.	Then you shouldn't have begged me to hire him.

1 But I mean really... wonderfully...  great.	Absolutely.

1 Thanks for inviting me over. Where's the little guy?	He's asleep.  Watch out for that lamp.
2 I'm glad you're home.  That "alone" thing is... not my specialty...

1 Well.	Sorry about this hand.  You know that feeling -- you're not completely embarrassed yet, but you glimpe tomorrow's embarrassment?
2 Don't worry about it, boss.	Oh shit.  You said "boss."
3 Yeah, I did.	Now I feel like Clarence Thomas.
4 No.  No don't feel like Clarence Thomas.	No, I do.  I feel like Clarence Thomas.  I'm like... harrassing you... right now.
5 I may not sue.

1 Well -- this would be goodnight.	Good night.

1 It's my fault.	What --
2 It's not fair to you.  This whole --	Tell me -- let me help --
3 I took advantage of you and worst of all, I'm not alone. I did this with a kid.  I was just on some ride where I thought I was in 1ove enough for both of us.  I did this.  And at least I can do something about it now.	Well -- I'm not the guy who's going to run.  I stick.
4 I don't need you to "stick."	You want...
5 I don't know --	...my soul or something. _ 117.

1 I heard.	No kidding.  I looked over and saw the shadow of two curious shoes in the doorway of the kitchen.
2 This guy would go home with a gardening tool right now if it showed interest.  Wait.  Use the frosted glasses.	Thank you.
3 Look, here's some of that chicken with salsa too, I warmed it up -- _ 74.

1 Matt, I came here because in all honesty your son is just another piece of cattle to SMI.  But to me --	We decided to stay with you.

1 --  now to recap, I want to stay in Arizona, I want my new contract, I like you, you're nice to my wife, I will stay with you, that's what I'm doing for you, but here's what you're gonna do for me. You listening?	Mmm.  Hmm.
2 It's a very personal, very important thing.  It's a family motto.  So I want to share it with you.  You ready?	Yes.
3 Here it is.  "Show me the money."  Show.  Me.  The.  Money. _ 36.

1 See this jacket I'm wearing?  You like it?  I don't really need it, because I'm CLOAKED IN FAILURE. I lost the number one draft pick the night before the draft. They will teach my story to other agents on "do not do this" day in agent school. Why? Let's recap. Because a hockey player's kid made me feel like a superficial jerk, I had two slices of bad pizza, went to bed, grew a conscience and wrote a 25-page Manifesto of Doom!	Well, boo-fucking-hoo.
2 The least you could do is nod and act sympathetic --	No.
3 It's a quality that might come in handy for a commercial sometime. _ 69.

1 What's wrong.	Forget it.  Forget it.
2 No tell me. _ 84.

1 Tidwell moves to a tan in a wheelchair, signs an autograph and moves on.  Jerry alongside. The quarterback sucks, man.  He's gonna get me killed.	I'm a little worried --
2 I'm worried too.  I'm worried that the only reason I'm here getting my brains blown loose is that you weren't asshole enough to get my ten million three months ago.

1 You're with the sports people on the plane, right?	Jerry Maguire.  SMI.
2 Bobbi Fallon.  BPI.  I'm producing the Coke commercials for the playoffs.	Well.  Good luck with that --

1 I'll go back to them.	And say what?  "Please remove your dick from my ass?!"

1 You...	You did this to yourself.  You said "fewer clients."  You put it all on paper.  Scully was very upset.  Heart attacks make some people sweeter, but not him.  You did this to yourself --

1 I don't see any.	Funny.
2 Funny...   I better go to bed.

1 Eric!	Quiet!

1 Her new boyfriend.	A friend. We were vacationing. Eric wanted to see the island and the dinosaurs, so Ben found a guy who would take them parasailing. They never came back.
2 We called everyone, did everything we could. Because of all the controversy over this island, no one will step in. Costa Rica says it's a no-fly zone, it's their own damn fault. Guys at the U.S Embassy -- our U.S. Embassy -- said we should "accept the inevitable." You believe that?

1 It's not safe.	We have to help him.

1 We should try fishing again.	You mean it?
2 I do. It's worth another shot. And who knows? Things might turn out differently.

1 We have to keep looking for Dad. We have to.	I know. I know. I want to look for him too.
2 then we should...

1 Absolutely not.	They're here.
2 What?

1 You have to believe me. I did it with the best intentions.	Some of the worst things imaginable have been done with the best intentions. You rushed in with no thought to the consequences, to yourself or anyone else.  You're no better than the people who built this place.

1 Eric, your parents are both here.	In Costa Rica?
2 On the island.

1 Do you have any kids?	No. Although I've studied them in the wild.

1 That's a very nice offer, Mr. Kirby, but I'm afraid I'm much to busy. If you like I can refer you to a number of highly qualified...	No, no, see Dr. Grant, you're the best. You've seen these animals in the flesh. No one else has come close to you.
2 I'm flattered, but I've taken this little adventure tour. And with the air restrictions they've imposed after the incident in San Diego, you cant fly low enough to see anything of interest.

1 Whatever you do, don't call the U.S. Embassy. They won't do a God Damn thing.	Well, we don't exactly have a Costa Rican phone book here, so it will have to be somebody we know in the states. Someone we can absolutely count on to send help.
2 Stan.

1 Why didn't you tell us about these guys, Ian?!	Because I didn't know!  I don't have the faintest idea what they're doing here.

1 Are you looking for a problem?	Everyone, keep your voices down!

1 "InGen."  What's InGen?	Where does it say that?
2 On the side of that one truck.

1 What?	I hadn't planned on bringing carnivores back because of the liability risk, but I only thought of adults, it never occurred to me --  You are a billion dollar idea, my little f-

1 If I don't move, I can't shoot it.	Let it go, Peter.  The animal won.

1 Then this is our chance.	Our chance to do what?
2 I don't know these guys, but I know 'em.  I've seen 'em on Japanese whalers, French barges trying to dump barrels of nuclear waste in the North Atlantic.  They're all the same. They spray us with water cannon when we try to stop 'em, sink our boats, and then call us crazy.

1 No.  I'm quite certain you can't.	Look, we have two choices.  We can hike back down to the lagoon, where we can sit for two days, in the open, next to a heavily used water source while we're waiting for your boat to arrive, or we can head for the village, where we might find some shelter and we can call for help.
2 We'd never make it past the raptors. Trust me, I have some experience in this matter.

1 Can you set up?	It has to be temporary, something that'll break apart and fall off as the animal grows...
2 Think fast, Sarah.

1 The kid scores with cheap sentiment.	Ian, if we recall the boat now, we've made two invasive landings in one day.  That'll have to go in any paper I write, and it will leave room for people to say our findings were contaminated.  You know the academic world as well as I do, once they smell blood in the water, you're dead.  Our presence has got to be one hundred percent antiseptic.  That means if we bend a blade of grass, we bend it right back the way it-

1 We have to send someone to look for him!	You go if you like, but we're not waiting for you.  MOVE IT OUT!!

1 Phones are out too.	Where did the vehicles stop?

1 What?  No menthol?	Mr Nedry, Mr Nedry.  The embryos have to be back here in San Jose by then.
2 That's up to your guy on the boat.  Seven o'clock tomorrow night, at the east dock. Make sure he got it right.	I was wondering, how are you planning to beat the security?
3 I got an eighteen minute window.  Eighteen minutes, and your company catches up on ten years of research.

1 Did I say jerk?	I'm sorry for the dramatic entrance, but I'm in a hurry. Will you have a wee bit of a drink now and then?

1 But you know, I should  really be the one going .	Why?
2 Well, because you're a - - I'm a - -	Look.

1 Ellie, we can tear up the rule book on cold-bloodedness. It doesn't apply, they're totally wrong!  This is a warm-blooded creature.  They're totally wrong.	They were wrong.  Case closed.  This thing doesn't live in a swamp to support it's body weight for God's sake!

1 - - like birds - -	- - like birds.  What happen is, they swallow the stones and hold them in a muscular sack in their stomachs - -
2 - - a gizzard - -	- - which is called a gizzard, and it helps them mash their food, but what happens after a while - -
3 - - what happens is that after a while, the stones get smooth, every six weeks, so the animal regurgitates them - -	- - barfs them up - -
4 - - and swallows fresh ones.	And when she swallows the stones, she swallows the poison berries too.  That's what makes her sick.  Good work Tim.

1 What about the lysine contingency?  We could put that into effect!	What's that?

1 That's right.  Will break through.	I get ah - -
2 I know, it's very exciting.	And scary.
3 And scary.	When people try to control things that it's out of their power - -
4 It's anti-nature.	Anti-nature.

1 Hola, Juanito	Hola, bienvenido

1 And we can charge anything we want!  Two thousand a day, ten thousand a day - - people will pay it!  And then there's the merchandising - -	Donald, this park was not built to carter only to the super rich.  Everyone in the world's got a right to enjoy these animals.
2 Sure, they will, they will.  We'll have a - - coupon day or something.

1 Okay, that's not so bad, ah Tim?	Yes it is.
2 It's just like coming out of a tree house.  Did your dad ever build you a tree house, Tim, eh?	No.
3 Me too.  Okay.  Well, the main thing about climbing is never, never look down, never.	This is impossible.  How am I going...I can't make it. This is...it's about fifty feet.
4 So am I going to help you with your foot?	What if the car falls?  What if the wheels fall?

1 Go, go, go, jump!	You're crazy!  I'm not gonna jump!
2 Tim, you're going to have to let go of the fence.  Tim! Get down right now.  Get off the fence!  Now!

1 Where does he think he's going?	When you gotta go, you gotta go.

1 Robert.  Robert Muldoon, my game warden from Kenya.  Bit of an alarmist, I'm afraid, But he's dealt with the raptors more than anyone.	Alan Grant.  Tell me, what kind of metabolism do they have?  What's their growth rate?  rate of growth.

1 Hear that?  Are you hearing this?	No, I didn't hear anything.  No, we're okay.

1 Do as he says!  The power's coming back, Timmy!	Timmy, let go!  You're gonna have to let go!  Count to three.  I'll catch you.
2 Timmy!  Do as he says!  Timmy!  Do as Dr. Grant says, quick!

1 I think perhaps I'll just sit down.  I don't suppose you think all that much of me now, do you?	You're all right, John You're okay.  It's just you don't have intelligence.  You have "thinktelligence."  You think narrowly and call it "being focused."  You don't see the consequences.  You're very good at solving problems, at getting answers - - but you just don't know the right questions.

1 I don't know, I don't know.  I'm sorry - -	Why did you do this?
2 I don't know!  I'm sorry!

1 Fifty.	Fifty? We need seventy-five.
2 Ken, we've been through this...

1 There doesn't seem to be any water damage. Kind of cozy, actually.	I really think we should go back...
2 I want to look at the rest of the house.

1 What's going on?	Some kind of emergency back at the Sheriff's Station. Four deputies shot... some kind of explosion... I don't know what's going on, but they're panicking back there.

1 Now... I think the video store's open for another couple of hours. Let's go.	Video store?

1 That's the problem with this case. Everyone thinks they know Jason's life story. But they don't. What you're remembering is a _movie_. Fiction. In the movie, Jason's mother runs around, killing people after Jason drowns in Crystal Lake	None of that's true?
2 Well, Jason _was_ in a canoe accident in 1967 and presumed drowned. His mother died a few years later after a long bout with cancer. Some time in the early eighties, there were a string of murders out by Crystal Lake...  People started saying it was Jason... back from the dead.	So, what are you saying... that he didn't kill all those people?
3 My job is not to determine his guilt or innocence. That's up to the jury. My job is defend him.

1 I thought you said Krueger burned to death.	That's right. The murders in the eighties were never solved.  But... there were teenaged witnesses who said Krueger had the ability to appear in your dreams... and that if he killed you in a dream, it would kill you in the real world.
2 Uh-huh...	Don't you see? Jason was _asleep_. And he was dreaming -- the REM patterns prove that. And I saw finger blades just like Krueger's come out of Jason's chest. There has to be a connection.
3 Yeah... I think I understand...  You're drunk, too.

1 Where's he going?	I don't know... but I think he's pissed.
2 Great. Now there's _two_ serial killers on the loose.	Krueger's the greater danger right now. We have to stop him.  _Springwood_. That's where he'll go. That's where he's always gone. But Springwood's not like Crystal Lake. There's a couple hundred thousand people there. He could be anywhere.

1 It's only majestic from here. When you get closer you see it for what it really is.	What is it really?
2 A glorified office block.  They keep all the old records there -- the final resting place for facts and figures that have ceased to matter in the world of the living.	Well, as long as I admire it from afar it shouldn't worry me if it's hollow.

1 Gabriela was right -- it's easier for me to understand suicide. I'm a practicing suicide.	-- In what sense?

1 In an organization as efficient as ours, if a document once in a great while gets lost it might never be found at all.	Burgel, I thought it would be easier, as long as I was passing --
2 But <u>I'm</u> the messenger.  An error like this damages my credibility.	Your credibility -- yes, it's well known.
3 When I deliver a message the very act of delivering it, you might say, gives it an official stamp, and only in this way are both the sender and the receiver satisfied that it was delivered at all.	I'll commit that to memory.

1 I'm sorry, but I just wondered --	Excuse me, I have to copy this for Central Docketing by 2:30.

1 Ah -- we're back to the "authorities" you spoke of.	They're ubiquitous.  What we try to do ... is make them a little less so.

1 Or what if there really <u>was</u> an error? -- I don't know what kind -- any kind that needed correcting -- and what if Burgel was responsible for it?  One mistake -- even a small one in a firm like ours -- it could cost him a promotion.	First these nameless authorities were the root of all evil, now it's insignificant Burgel.  If indeed there was a mistake -- and a minor one at that -- you're suggesting someone went to a lot of trouble over something so trivial as to not matter at all.
2 What seems important to these people is not determined by the amount of work it entails -- you're far from understanding the authorities if you believe that.	Now Burgel's one of the authorities?

1 Maybe it's true then what she said.	What did she say?
2 That the police may have allegiance to something other than truth.

1 -- You said so yourself the firm is large and powerful.  If the discrepancy really was something big, Eduard's responsibility would still have to be small.  No poor young <u>clerk</u> could find himself in such a fix.	When a scapegoat is needed, my friend ...

1 -- And the new patients they bring me aren't usually as dexterous as you've been in evading us.  Not perfect specimens by any means, but not the type of person who'll be missed either.	What have you done with Gabriela Rossmann?
2 As a matter of fact you've caught us in a state of considerable excitement.  Our latest preparation we believe -- we pray -- is perfected. It should take years off her.

1 They keep switching us from department to department.  He doesn't mind because he can't sit still.	We used to be in the supply section, carrying boxes of medicine about but we dropped too many of them.
2 It's not too bad working here.

1 Can I see the map? My father spoke of references to a Beast God ...	Kong is a myth, nothing but a native superstition, Miss Darrow. All we're going to find on that island are some primitive people in grass skirts. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm trying to reduce my handicap.

1 Oh God, it's that bloody yank!	Now now, Ann! Try be to polite.

1 It's the same image - Kong!	Leave it, Ann.

1 They're stoking the boilers. As soon as we've got some steam, we're outta here.	We should never have come! I pay you good money, only to have my life endangered. You'll be hearing from my lawyer!

1 Hey! I thought these things were supposed to be extinct!	) They are now.

1 Are you gonna start it up?	Yeah.
2 Why?	Coz of something I lost.
3 What's that?	Compassion.
4 What's compassion, mister.

1 -- I have to close up now. Leave your name and number with his message service, Mrs. Daniel, and why don't you just go home and wait until he --	No.
2 Well I have to close up now.	Look -- could I use your phone?
3 Yes indeed.	Look. I almost killed my -- I almost killed someone.
4 Well I'm certain Doctor Spangler will want to talk with you; excuse me.

1 Who?	Tom Grunemann. He wrote you some letters.
2 Gee.	He was a research engineer at the Tuscarora Laboratories in Pennsylvania. He disappeared from there last April. I've been hired to look for him.
3 Why?	You know what I'm talking about. Miss Daniel.
4 Honest?	Will you let me ask you some questions?
5 Dew yew hayuv ah-dentifikyshun?

1 Klute, tell me, what's your bag? Are you a talker, or a button man or a doubler, or maybe you like them very young -- children -- or get your chest walked around with high-heeled shoes, or have us watch you tinkle? Or --	-- OK --
2 -- You want to wear women's clothes, or you get off ripping things --

1 Oh golly, oh just what I've always dreamed of, dirty phone calls.  How come?	You told me what you could. I guess I'm through with your part of it.
2 Is there anything more I could --	I don't see anything, do you?
3 What're you gonna do next?	Try some other ways. 
4 What do I do meanwhile? -- wait for that clown to fall through the skylight on me?	And I don't think that was Tom.
5 You said it was!	No, I said what did you think.
6 Oh -- wait -- oh I get it. You said that just to keep me scared. So I'd tell you everything I -- oh clever; oh you smart, tricky hick.	Well --
7 Hey, but did we get to you, Klute? A little?	Yeah, you got to me.
8 -- Us city folks? The sin, the glitter, the wickedness?	Oh. No. Not that way. I'd say it was more -- I don't know --  -- too bad? Pathetic?
9 Goodbye.

1 Please.	We did this before.
2 No.  Well all right. But you want to and I want you to and we both know it and all right.	I don't like getting splashed.

1 Where'd you spend last night?	With Trina.
2 I called Trina.	Maybe I wasn't there when you called.
3 Bree, what's actually happened? It wasn't that bad.	How do you know how bad it was?
4 Why couldn't you stay here with me?	Because I didn't want to be touched! I didn't think you'd get that!

1 All right, suppose it wasn't Tom Grunemann; where does that get you?	It's where it doesn't get me. I've got nothing left that connects to anything.
2 Then, close the case.	I better keep looking.
3 Where, how?	I could try Arlyn Page again. She saw much more of the Dumper than Bree Daniel.
4 You just finished telling me she had nothing to offer. Not Tom, you said, the Dumper was clearly not Tom.	It's got to make sense some way.

1 I'm looking for a man. Tom Grunemann.  Bree thinks he may have been the dumper -- that call she had two years ago. She says you sent her on it.	Two years ago? Sorry.
2 They tell me you use narcotics. Could I bring someone around to look at your arms?	Look -- dad -- I may stand better with the cops than you.

1 Think this is our guy?	I don't know. It looks familiar to me.
2 Thought it might. It's off an arrest report you typed two years ago. Man you wanted samples of everybody.

1 Mr. Kramer, do you ever have sex in here with anyone?	Doctor, I attempt to conduct my social life discreetly.  At the moment I am seeing no one.
2 Does that distress you?	Not particularly.
3 What does?	The prospect of losing my child.
4 Very well, I'd like to see him if I may.

1 I'll tell you what, kiddo--why don't I fix us some French toast?	Wow!  French toast, really?
2 Sure.  Didn't I ever tell you French toast was my specialty? I'll bet I never told you that. Now then, the first thing we need is...  ... eggs!  Right?

1 Mom, I mean dad...	In a minute...

1 Daddy?	Yeah?
2 I'm sorry...	That's okay, pal.  Go back to sleep.  It's very late.

1 Objection.	Sure.  Lots of times.

1 Objection!	Overruled.  The witness will answer, please.

1 Objection!	Your honor, I would request a direct answer to a direct question.  Does she have a lover?

1 Ummm, hmmm... umm, hmmm...  Well, this looks very good.. Of course  ... you understand this is the worst time of the year to look for a job.	What?!  What do you mean, I don't understand.
2 Mr. Kramer, nobody even thinks about leaving their job until after they get their Christmas bonus.	Look, you don't understand.  I need a job.  I've got a kid and--
3 I understand and I'm absolutely sure something wonderful will turn up....  ...after the first of the year.

1 My American Express...My Bloomingdale's Credit Card... My check book--	Okay, okay...What is it this time? What did I do now?...
2 I took two thousand out of the savings account.  That was what I had in the bank when we got married.	Joanna, whatever it is, believe me, I'm sorry.
3 Here are the slips for the laundry and the cleaning.  They'll be ready on Saturday.	Now listen, before you do something you'll really regret you'd better stop and think--
4 I've paid the rent, the Con-Ed and the phone bill, so you don't have to worry about them.

1 Joanna, go be a mother.  Get married, have kids.  Don't get married, have kids.  Do whatever you want.  I don't give a damn. Just leave me out of it--and leave my baby out of it.	Ted, if you can't discuss this rationally--
2 Joanna, go fuck yourself!

1 Listen, don't let it get you down.  You're going to be fine.	Me?  I've never been better. I mean having my wife walk out on me after seven years of marriage agrees with me just fine.
2 Look, Ted, I'm the oldest whore on the beat, okay?  Three marriages, two divorces...You're gonna be okay.	I'm going to be okay.  The way I see it, Joanna'll come home, it's just a matter of time.
3 She'll be back...

1 Okay, Phyllis, what's up?	Kramer...

1 Look, she walked out on her own child, right?  That's desertion, right? Mr. Shaunessy, I'm telling you it's an open and shut case.	First, there's no such thing as an open and shut case. Especially where custody is involved.  Got it?

1 What?!  She wants what?!	She's the mother.  That means she's within her legal rights.
2 John, what if she kidnaps him.

1 I've got enough trouble raising my own kid.  I don't need another one.  Got it?	Got it.
2 You're on your own, understand?	I understand.
3 You're sure?	I'm sure.

1 Please go away, Thel...I...I just have to be by myself for a little while...	Ted, I just heard...
2 Please, Thel...

1 I am sorry, Lhamo.	It is alright, Father.

1 Do you have plans to return soon, Dalai Lama?	Soon.
2 Good. Our first request is that you allow us to build a road. You have no roads in Tibet. We can discuss the plans in Lhasa. When you return.

1 Oh, no. Where will he go?	Far, far away.

1 May I listen to the news with you, Holiness?	Please.

1 What is the size of our army, now?	Eight thousand, five hundred, soldiers and officers. We have recently requested mortars, anti-aircraft guns and ammunition from India. We have several hundred in the area.

1 The pursuit of non-violence. Very difficult.	Non-violence means co-operation when it is possible. Resistance, when it is not.

1 I have news. The Regent has resigned his post.	Is he a bad man? Norbu says he is "lavish" and "willful". "How can he give you monk's vows if he has not kept them himself?"
2 Well, some say. It's not for you to worry about. Another will be chosen.	He was always nice to me. He found me. He saw me in his dreams.

1 We have enemies.	The Chinese.
2 Yes.	But, surely, we are safe in Tibet. We don't believe in killing.

1 Taktra Rinpoche, I understand there was an attempt on your life.	It is possible, Holiness.
2 You are unharmed?	Completely.
3 Good. Where is Reting Rinpoche now?

1 And how would you have accomplished this, Ma'am?	Well, he was very ill and he refused to go see a doctor and well... I think he had Alzheimer's, he would be coherent one day, incoherent the next and one <u>coherent</u> day, he asked me to end his suffering.  I wouldn't <u>do</u> it but he kept insisting and insisting and deteriorating till the point the only cognitive thing he could really do was that I finish him off.  Finally I just gave in and hit him on the head with a skillet then buried him under the bulkhead.

1 I might get a shot.	<u>No</u>.  If you don't kill him instantly, I'm dead and you'll only kill him instantly if you get his brain, which is about the size of a cherry.  And even if you <u>were</u> on target, a bullet might not penetrate his hide.
2 Jesus.  About twelve more yards.  Keep coming just like that.

1 Jesus Christ!!	What the hell are you doing?!!
2 What are <u>you</u> doing?!	You're crawling around like a--
3 I'm laying a spring trap!	A spring trap!
4 I keep telling you, they <u>can</u> come on land, I don't wanna wake up in the middle of the night--	I coulda shot you, you--
5 This could end up saving your life,--

1 Maybe he doesn't play well with others.	Is everything a big fucking joke to you?
2 <u>Bite</u> <u>my</u> <u>bishop</u>.

1 Well, you can try talking them into that, if--	I have enough flaxedil with me to put him out.  And I think I know a way to--
2 <u>Forget</u> <u>it</u>.	Look.  I know I'm crazy, but when they come, they will kill it.  They have to, politically, he's too dangerous, if something were to go wrong... the odds are he will be destroyed,--

1 You take care.	You talk to Bickerman?
2 She didn't tell us about the other croc 'cause she was afraid we'd blow it's head off.	Women's intuition.  Are there anymore?
3 Just those two.

1 <u>Did</u> you want to be killed by it?	You think I'm <u>that</u> nuts?
2 Hector.  What you just did... there was at least some sort of a death wish going on.	Nothing's real.
3 Excuse me?	<u>Nothing's</u> real.  I'm rich, people are automatically my friends, sycophants ooze out like oil slicks and and and--

1 Did you make anything of the tooth?	Yes, it <u>did</u> seem prehistoric but I'm sure he just carried the thing for luck.  Not that it <u>worked</u>, obviously.  It probably somehow got lodged into his body.

1 He could be right there and you wouldn't see him.	I'd be able to see something.

1 You know they say the brain confuses fear for passion.	Excuse me?
2 When you get scared, the brain releases a chemical, same chemical it releases when somebody's...  in high school, the thing to do was to take the girl to a scary movie.	What are you talking about?
3 I'm saying between the moonlight, a beautiful lake <u>and</u> a monster that bites heads off... you look good.	Gee, that was so poetic, Jack.  I'm all moist.
4 Forgive me for trying to be nice.	Nice?  Nice would be "you look pretty," nice is not some man- eating monster has tricked my brain into making you look good.
5 I didn't say it like that.	You <u>did</u>, you--
6 I was trying to pay you a compliment, I was guising it as science 'cause I know you're comfortable in that arena. Science.	A man just died, you're hitting on me with science.
7 Just forget it.

1 Thing we can lift it?	Maybe.  Don't mush it.
2 I'm not mushing it.	You're mushing it a little around the--
3 <u>I'm</u> <u>not</u> <u>mushing</u> <u>it</u>.

1 Hector!!	Take him.

1 That was... y'know if the guy asks me can she kiss, now I'll be able to tell him if you can.	Good thinking.

1 I can't.  I'll get Hector!!	Where is he?!

1 You're sort of a rude person.	It's just that--

1 Was that like a homo-sexual remark?	I asked you to be nice to him.

1 If he gets close, you go <u>up</u>, Hector, don't you endanger that cow.	She's worried about the cow now.

1 Oh.  Oh.  That's okay.  Well.  This uh... this probably wasn't meant to be, y'know.  I mean, I'm... God, I gotta be ten years younger and you, <u>you</u>... you're y'know...	A jerk.
2 <u>Oh</u>...  No, no, I'm not angry I'm not, I'm just thrown, I'm...  I actually have an early lunch, so...	It's ten after nine.
3 Yes, well...  famished.

1 You missed Fourth Amendment law. Unlawful seizure, real juicy stuff. Where were you all afternoon?	Pleading with a crazy man, with come all over my face.

1 Wear it, don't ever leave it in your purse. Dry fire it whenever you get the chance. And do your exercises.	I will... I promise.
2 Listen, I hope you never need a thing I've taught you. But you've got something... Jack sees it, I do too. If you ever need to, you can shoot.

1 Do you need a police escort, Starling? Or do you think you can find the airport by yourself?	Yes sir. I can find it by myself.

1 Are they close to catching somebody, do you think?	I think we may be, yes.

1 Okay, Starling. Let's have it.	You haven't said a word today about that garage. Or what I found there.
2 What should I say? You did fine work. We'll wait on the lab.	You knew. You knew from the start that Lecter held the key to this... But you weren't up front with me. You sent me in to him naked.
3 Are you finished?	He starts this - buzzing in me, in my head. He makes me feel violated... You used me, Mr. Crawford.

1 All his victims are women... His obsession is women, he lives to hunt women. But not one women is hunting him - except me. I can walk in a woman's room and know three times as much about her as a man would.  I have to go to Belvedere.	You heard them. I don't have that authority anymore.
2 You do until six p.m.

1 Doctor, we have a hard problem in psychological profiling. I want to ask for your help with a questionnaire.	"We" being the Behavioral Science Unit, at Quantico. You're one of Jack Crawford's, I expect.
2 I am, yes.	May I see your credentials?

1 "Plum Island Animal Disease Research Center." Sounds charming.	That's just part of the island. It has a very nice beach. Terns nest there.
2 Terns... If I help you, Clarice, it will be "turns" with us, too. Quid pro quo. I tell you things, you tell me things. Not about this case, though - about yourself. Yes or no?  Yes or no, Clarice. Catherine is waiting. Tick-tock, tick-tock...

1 They were slaughtering the spring lambs?	Yes...! They were screaming.
2 So you ran away...	No. First I tried to free them... I opened the gate of their pen - but they wouldn't run. They just stood there, confused. They wouldn't run...
3 But you could. You did.	I took one lamb. And I ran away, as fast as I could...

1 Look... search your own records, if you prefer. You can do it a lot faster than us, anyway. If we find Buffalo Bill through your information, I'll suppress it. Nobody has to know this hospital cooperated.	I doubt very much that the FBI or any other government agency can keep a secret, Mr. Crawford. Truth will out... And then what? Will you give Johns Hopkins a new identity? Put a big pair of sunglasses on this building, and a funny nose?
2 Oh, that's clever, Dr. Danielson. Very humorous. You like the truth? Try this.  He kidnaps young women and kills them and rips their skin off. We don't want him to do that anymore. If you don't help me, just as fast as you can, then the Justice Department is going to ask publicly for a court order, We'll ask twice a day, just in time for the morning and evening news. And each one of our press conferences will focus on Dr. Danielson, over at Johns Hopkins, and how we're still hoping for his cooperation. And every time there's any news on the case - when Catherine Martin floats, when the next one floats, and the next one - why, we'll just issue another press release about good ol' Dr. Danielson, over at Johns Hopkins - complete with all his humorous fucking remarks.	It may be that - I could confer with my colleagues on this. And get back to you.
3 Would you, Doctor? That would be so kind.

1 Are you alright?	Can we rest soon?
2 Absolutely.

1 Mr Poe?	Miss.  May I?

1 Where will we go?	Winter with the Delaware, my father's cousins. And in the spring, cross the Ohio and look for land to settle with my father in a new place called Can-tuck-ee.

1 I see...	I am sorry, Duncan...

1 Who were these people?	Ottawa!
2 Excuse me...

1 So what is it, Jack? What brings you up here?	A French & Indian army out of Fort Carillon's heading south to war against the English. I'm here to raise this county's militia to aid the British defense.
2 Folks here goin' to join in that fight?	We'll see in the morning...

1 Many men here, their homes are in the path.	That's all, sir.

1 Things were done. Nobody was spared...	Terrible feature of war in the Americas.  Best to keep your sight fixed on our duty.

1 Men are to stay in file, Sergeant Major!	Yes sir!

1 That's where a lead bullet has torn you.	And this?

1 What's wrong?	Pretty good imitation of a hangover and I ought to know.

1 I've been looking at the duty roster...at the shack hours outstanding...	Uh, oh...I see where this is going...
2 ...all of you owe time and I thought tonight would be a good time to---

1 Go on!	No!
2 That's an order!	Fuck your orders!

1 How's astronaut training?	Why?  You going to give me hard time like the others?
2 No.  I'm just being friendly.	Good...It's going good.

1 It hit me!  Where are they?!	I can't see them!

1 Wait till you reach thirty- five before you blow your suit...	Roger.

1 What're you saying?  That we're not even going to be picked up tomorrow?	It shouldn't be a long delay.
2 But it's a delay!  How long? A day?  Two days?!	Twelve hours, no big deal.  We should know something first thing in the morning.  Don't worry.

1 Cute, DeJesus...Specimen cups?	Aw, loosen up, Bowman...  Hey, Willie, I got one served up for you.

1 Oooooh.  Damn!  Not so loud. Turn down the music.	What music?  There ain't no music.

1 Bad as he is there's no way we can make our quota with- out his sad self out there. You just can't do it.	He's tanking on us...

1 How far away is she?	Two hundred meters.

1 No...he's really sick.  I heard him last night.  The company will take that into consideration...	Honey, the company don't give a flying fuck about "whys," they just look at the numbers and the contract says if we miss our quota they only got to pay us half-pay for the entire month.

1 Are you sure you saw something?	How many times I got to tell you.  I saw a ship.
2 Well, why haven't they answered our flares?

1 Is there something we should know about you, Soap?	I am not sure what's more worrying, the job or your past.

1 Let me tell you about Hatchet Harry. Once there was this geezer called Smithy Robinson who worked for Harry. It was rumoured that he was on the take. Harry invited Smithy round for an explanation. Smithy didn't do a very good job. Within a minute Harry lost his temper and reached for the nearest thing at hand, which happened to be a fifteen-inch black rubber cock. He then proceeded to batter poor Smithy to death with this; that was seen as a pleasant way to go . . . Hence, Hatchet Harry is a man you pay if you owe.	I'll think of something, don't worry.

1 What's that?	A cocktail, you asked for a cocktail.
2 No, I asked you to give me a refreshing drink. I wasn't expecting a fucking rainforest; you could fall in love with an orang-utan in that.	You want a pint, go to the pub.
3 I thought this was a pub.	It's a Samoan pub.
4 Well whatever it is, could you get your man to turn the TV down?	You ask him if you like, but I would leave him to it if I was you.

1 Shotguns? What, like guns that fire shot?	Oh, you must be the brains then. That's right, guns that fire shot . . . Make sure you bring everything from inside the gun cabinet. There will be a load of guns, that's all I want. I'll pay you when you deliver. Everything outside the cabinet you can keep; it's yours.
2 Oh, thanks very much. And there had better be something there for us.	It's a fucking stately home, of course there'll be something there.

1 Son?	Made a few quid, did ya? Now where is it?

1 We gotta get those guns.	This is dangerous shit, Dean; we don't even know who lives in there.
2 Listen, I don't care who lives in there; all as I know it's got to be preferable to death by Hatchet.	Furry muff, let's go.

1 It must be this one.	Just give me the keys.

1 Are you sure you can afford twenty-five?	Well that depends on how you look at it. I can afford it as long as I see it again, if that's what you mean. You got the rest from the fat man and Bacon?

1 I don't think we will take the risk for seven hundred quid.	Tom, go and throw those guns off a bridge.

1 Tom, this is our case.	. . . What?
2 This is our money, Tom! . . . Now I think we should go.

1 That you, boy?	It's Ed, if that's what you mean.
2 It's pay day, ain't it?	I wanted to talk to you about that.
3 I bet you did. I have got half a million nicker sitting in front of me, which means that some poor sod doesn't. You must have upset a few people, boy . . . but that isn't really my concern, is it? But what does concern me is the guns you had. I want to talk to you about that. Get your arse over here now, and I do mean now!

1 Sawn-offs are out, Tom; people like to have a bit mare range nowadays.	Range? I don't want to blow the arse out of this country, granted, but I don't want anybody blowing a raspberry at me either. I want to look fucking mean.
2 Of course you will look mean, Tom, you will look really scary.	All right, let's forget about them for the time being. What about your weed man?
3 Rory Breaker is standing by. You stand to make a lot of money, Tommy boy.

1 This guy Rory Breaker can afford to do the deal at the price we are selling. It's not worth him giving us trouble; he knows we would be a pain in the arse, and who wants a pain in the arse?	I would take a pain in the arse for half a million.
2 You would take a pain n the arse full stop.	Tom, the fatter you get, the sadder you get.

1 I'm only going to have you for two more years. If you decide not to go on to college--	I can't take any more school.
2 --you're going to be on your own.	So?
3 So I'm worried about you. I don't want you to end up in jail like your friends.	They're not going to jail.
4 Don't try to con me, Amado. You knew how they got all those things.	Just some rich Anglo out on the lake. Don't even live here all year.
5 That makes it okay?	They stole our land--
6 Save your breath. That line doesn't cut it with me.

1 Sergeant Major? How is Richie doing? Private Graves?	He'll live.

1 What's that for?	Jimmy got a kitchen full of wetbacks, most of 'em relatives. People breed like chickens.
2 So?	I roust some muchacho on the street, doesn't have his papers, all he got to say is "Yo trabajo para Jimmy Herrera."

1 Where'd he get all this?	Your mother got a brother--Alphonse--
2 Uncle Al--	Otis stood on good terms with the man. Whenever you do something makes the news, he sends it on. When they made you General, Otis just about drove away all our customers going on about it.
3 I'm a colonel.	Yeah, I know--Man made me memorize the whole damn Army chain of command before he'd marry me. So this is a big deal, commander and  all?
4 It's a small post and they're phasing it out in two years, but I moved up in rank and--well, a command is a command.	Otis went on like you were that guy who won the Gulf War. Colin whatsit.
5 My mother said he never asked about--	He never asked her.

1 Homework?	I finished that. I'm just messing around.
2 Tanks, huh?	You got to be in the Army, you might as well have something slick to drive.
3 So you're going into the Army?

1 Since I've been stationed here? A fistfight now and then--	We had a kid pass out in the men's room. The town isn't much.

1 Sheriff--hi--this is Sergeant--this is Priscilla Worth.	Pleased to meet you.
2 Sheriff Deeds was in on our archeological find yesterday.

1 Your boys out there cooped up together, need somewhere they can let the steam out. If they're Black, there's not but one place in this town they feel welcome. Been that way since before you were born.	We have an enlisted man's club at the post.
2 Well, you're the Man out there now, aren't you? It's your call.	That's right.
3 I been hearing rumors about this new commander coming for a couple weeks now. Boys say they heard he's a real hard case. Spit-and-polish man. Full- bird colonel name of Payne, they say-- Bet you never figured you end up back here.	The Army hands you a command, you go wherever it is.
4 Right.	I hear things, too.  People call you the Mayor of Darktown.
5 Over the years, this is the one place that's always been there. I loan a little money out, settle some arguments. Got a cot in the back- people get afraid to go home they can spend the night. There's not enough of us to run anything in this town- the white people are mostly out on the lake now and the Mexicans hire each other. There's the Holiness Church and there's Big O's place.	And people make their choice--
6 A lot of 'em choose both. There's not like a borderline between the good people and the bad people--you're not either on one side or the other--

1 Es muy lindo, su coche--	En ingles Enrique. This is the United States. We speak English.
2 Is very beautiful, your car.	Good night, Enrique. She slides into the car--
3 Buenas noches, Senora Cruz. Enrique walks in the opposite direction--

1 Every other damn thing in the country is called after Martin Luther King, they can't let our side have one measly park?	King wasn't Mexican, Fenton--
2 Bad enough all the street names are in Spanish--

1 Dammit, Sam, the people are concerned about crime--	We need a drug rehab program, we need a new elementary school--

1 Besides my father, I mean.	There's no call for that, Sam. Fella made himself a pile of enemies over the years.
2 And Buddy was one of them.	We got that dedication tomorrow. This is a hell of a time to be draggin' up old business.
3 People have worked this whole big thing up around my father. If it's built on a crime, they deserve to know. Now I understand why you might want to believe he couldn't do it.	And I understand why you might want to think he could.

1 There isn't money allocated for that. But a jail--	Look, I'm not gonna campaign against your deal here, but if anybody asks me, I got to tell them the truth. We-- don't--need--a new jail.

1 Buddy was more a part of the big picture--county political machine, chamber of commerce, zoning board if I kept those people happy, he was pretty much on my side.  Whenever somebody thought--they start up another bar for the black  folks, they'd be--how should I put this? They'd be officially discouraged.	He ever accept cash for a favor?

1 You built our patio while you  were on the county?	Out in the fresh air, nice gringo lady making you pies--who's gonna sit back in a little jail cell all day? Sheriff Buddy, man. Como el no hay dos. And after that cabron Charley Wade--
2 I've heard Wade was a bit tough on the Mexicans--	He murdered Eladio Cruz. That tough enough for you?
3 Murdered him?	Chucho Montoya saw it with his own eyes. Shot him in cold blood.

1 I should get back.	Pilar--
2 Looks real bad if the teacher's late for class. It's really nice to talk with you, Sam.

1 Hospital says the other kid is in bad shape--	The shooter local?
2 Down from Houston. I think he knew the girl before.	Okay--we'll take a statement from all the GIs before they go back to post. You can get the story from Otis over at the club.
3 Any poop on the John Doe you found out there today?	Nothin' much. The Rangers put Ben Wetzel on it. Catch you later.

1 --but longhorns are hard to come by these days.	You sell much out here?
2 How am I gonna sell things if nobody comes by? This stretch of road runs between Nowheres and Nothin' Much.	Hell of a spot to put a business.
3 But you don't see much competition, do you?

1 Hello, L.A.	Have a nice evening, Mr. D'Amour.
2 You bet.

1 Thanks, Billy.	Hey, anytime.  Actually, no.  This was enough.

1 We've all of us waited too long to have the homecoming spoiled.	What do you mean, "all of us?"
2 You didn't think it was just going to be you and me?  A lot of people believed in Nix. They haven't forgotten his promise.	About?
3 Death.	What about death?
4 It's an illusion.

1 Ever watched a man die?  If you watch very closely, you can sometimes see the soul escaping. And if you're very quick, you can catch it.	Please... Butterfield... I wasn't there.  Ask Pimm.
2 Pimm's dead.  Jennifer Desiderio's disappeared.  They knew the Puritan was coming home.

1 He's good.	You haven't seen anything yet.

1 It's okay.	No it isn't.  You can't help me.
2 I'm here, aren't I?

1 ... oh... God...	I'm here, Harry.
2 ...yes?	Yes.

1 I'm putting in a new illusion tonight.  Will you be there?	Sure.  You want me to find out about Quaid?  I mean, the funeral?
2 No.  I'm not going near him.

1 With what?	Evil.  He was evil.  Come on.

1 I can't let you in.	Yeah, I know.
2 You want more money, is that it?

1 My God.	What?
2 You've taken some strange journeys in your life.	Yeah.  You could say that.
3 You're drawn to the dark side, over and over.  And it's drawn to you.  You don't like that.	Not much.
4 You can't change it.  You have to walk...  ...walk the line between Heaven and Hell.  It's your destiny.  Accept it.

1 So Nix won't come looking for her?	It's me betrayed him.
2 And she shot him I  I think that'd piss me off if I were Nix.	I don't know what else to do.
3 Help me.

1 He did something with the ground.	Yes?
2 Can you do it?	I don't know.
3 Try.

1 You could still help me do that.	Why would I want to?
2 Because you've got nothing else to live for.	Not true.
3 The woman has a new love in her life.  Your friends are dead. Nobody's left to save you, but me

1 A Soul's Search: Finding Your True Calling - are you reading this?	No.

1 Do you remember when we met at the bar? ...You were wearing a tuxedo.	But the first time I saw you was in the elevator.
2 Really?	Yeah, you don't remember?

1 It's bad isn't it?	We should get you to the doctor.
2 You think so?	Yeah, look at that thing.

1 I don't want to go back tomorrow.	I know. But, it doesn't last, you have to go back sometime.
2 Why can't it last?	I don't know, it just doesn't, reality changes things....we can't stay here forever, unless maybe we started a Jazz band.

1 Hello?	Bob?
2 Hi, Lydia.	Is this a bad time?
3 Uh, no.	It's really hard to reach you... Did you get the carpet samples? I like the burgundy.
4 Ok, whatever you think... I'm lost.	It's just carpet.
5 That's not what I'm talking about.	What are you talking about?
6 I don't know.	Is there anything I can do?
7 I don't know... I want to be more healthy. I want to eat better.	What?
8 You know, eat healthier.	Alright?
9 Not all that pasta.	Fine.
10 Like Japanese food.	Why don't you just stay there, and you can have it everyday.
11 Oh, come on.	I have to go, Adam's tormenting Zoe, I'll talk to you later. Are you going to be Ok?
12 Yeah, I'll be fine. Bye.

1 I gotta go meet Kelly for a drink downstairs. She wants to talk about some photo thing.	Ok. Maybe I'll walk down with you.
2 You wanna come?	Sure.
3 Ok.

1 A Soul's Search: Finding Your True Character and calling? Is this yours?	Oh... that's nothing, someone gave it to me.
2 You don't have to be embarrassed.	I'm not. It's just corny, but I'm not into it.
3 It's ok if you are.

1 Uh..thanks.	Sorry if I have the worst B.O., I've been sweating in this little room with T.V. lights for hours...

1 Hey, what are you doing here in the middle of the day?	Forgot my car keys.  What are you doing on the fourth floor?
2 I spaced out.	Well, it's a nice surprise.  Should I hit the "stop" button?

1 Listen to me, I love you, Peter, I'm trying to protect you!	You really had me going, Claire.  I was finally ready to propose to you.
2 We're still going to be together.

1 So you don't believe his condition is the result of anything supernatural?	Of course not.  They put him through severe mental stress.  Causing this aneurysm.

1 Between your book sales and this TV thing, there's going to be no living with you.  And let me guess, you boiled God down to a conceit.	You know how I feel.  The world is random.  The only certainty I believe in is death.
2 Given all that's happened, I understand. The world is random, but then there's faith.  Where are you in death without it?

1 Father, please don't die.	...art sank, sun set, ark sank again...

1 You're sure?  There was nothing?	I cranked it all the way up.  Nothing but hum.

1 Peter, I believe your baptism was perverted.  Look at your certificate. Your mother was the only witness to it. Your blood-type doesn't match who you thought your father was.  Peter...I'm sorry.	And if what you're saying is true, what would happen to me?
2 I don't know.  I do know that people who are possessed have to accept evil in some way.  I don't know if it works the same way in this instance.  I don't even know when it's going to happen.

1 He couldn't stop us and that's how he was punished.  Peter, what time were you born?	I don't know.  Probably have a copy of my birth certificate...my apartment.

1 Book five, Deuteronomy, chapter seven, verse five.  "But this shall you deal with them.  You shall break down their altars and burn their graven images with fire."	And what's that mean?

1 You know what?  You can go.	Suit yourself.  But does this mean anything to you?

1 What's this?	So you can see where you're going when you crawl up his asshole.

1 Ah, Mom.	I'm lucky I found it.  Someone put your box of dresses under a pile of rags in the garbage.

1 Hi.	Need any help?
2 I can manage.

1 Okay.	Thanks, sweetheart.

1 I can take it.	This time get your feet set.

1 That was nice.	Uh-huh.
2 Your sister told me hands off, but I can't help myself...

1 You need to.  She's alone in this house all day, taking care of Dad and your ungrateful behind.	No one's forcing her.
2 Just try and chill a little bit, alright.

1 That's what you get for trying to show out, freshman.	I was just playing ball.
2 You were trying to make me look bad.	Didn't have to try very hard.

1 So...does it hurt?	It's this big hole.  You could almost see bone.
2 For real?	Uh huh.

1 See, that's why you ain't getting recruited.	Who said I'm not getting recruited?
2 Your hot-ass temper.

1 When'd you get this?	It was on my bed when I came in.  Can you just...?
2 You sure?

1 Yo, where's the "D"?	Right here.

1 Hey.	Hey, what's up.
2 You weren't at my game.	Yeah, sorry about that.  I had this meeting with this guy.

1 Shouldn't you be lying down, or...	I'm alright.  But you can sit.
2 I'm fine.  My dad said you tore your ACL.	Yup.
3 What are the doctors saying?	A lot of things.  All I know is I'll be back in six months.
4 I thought a torn ACL was ten to twelve.	Not for Quincy McCall.
5 I forgot, "Q-man."

1 You asked me what was missing.	What?
2 From basketball.	you woke me up to tell me that?
3 It's not fun for me anymore because you're missing.

1 We should head over.	Just you and Quincy, baby.  I got a meeting.
2 With who?	Business folks.
3 You just got back from a four game road trip.	Nona, don't start bitching.  I got maybe two years left to play.  I'm just trying to put some things together for us.

1 How was your game?	Twenty-seven points, eleven assists and still undefeated.
2 Still the man.	Yup.

1 Sorry.	No, you need to hear me say it, I'll say it.  It's not true.

1 It's been the same fuckin' thing for thirty years, Burt --	These adults are tough enough, I think you'll be surprised -- the Mexican's a bit of a question mark --

1 Wanna call me a slut now, something?	No.  No.

1 Wilson.	Ok.  Claudia Wilson: You tryin' to go deaf?
2 What?	Did you hear what I said?
3 Yeah, but I don't know --	-- listenin' to that music so loud: You Tryin' To Damage Your Ears?
4 No.	Well if you keep listenin' to the music that loud you're not only gonna damage your ears but your neighbors ears.
5 I didn't realize it was that loud.	And that could be the sign of a damaged ear drum, you understand?
6 Yeah.	You got the TV on too, keep those on at that same time usually?

1 This is my job.	We were just gettin' warmed up. We were just getting started.
2 Well if you listen' to that music too loud again and that fella returns maybe we'll share another cup of coffee --	If you're not here for a 422 --
3 No. No.  Don't joke about that. That's not funny, Claudia.  Please, now.	I'm sorry.
4 Ok, then.  Keep your chin up and your music down, alright?	Yes.  I will.  It was nice to meet you Officer Jim.
5 Just Jim.	yeah, good, ok.
6 Bye, bye, Claudia.	Good bye.

1 You live alone?	Yes.
2 What's your name?	Claudia.
3 Claudia What?

1 Richard, shut it and keep it down.	If he hadn't pissed his pants, we woulda won.  We fucking had this game.

1 Doc it's Janet.	What's up?
2 I have to talk to Frank, is he nearby?	He's doing the interview with the lady --
3 I need you to interupt him, I need to get him on the phone with me right away --	What happend?
4 Doc, go get Frank and put him on the phone.

1 Things go round 'n round, don't they?	Yes they do, they do, but I'll make my dreams come true, you see?  I will.
2 This sounds Sad as a Weeping Willow.	I used to be smart but now I'm just stupid.
3 Shall we drink to that?

1 I don't know.	You were gonna ask me weren't you?
2 I've been a good worker, Solomon. A hard and loyal --

1 Do you know Lily?  Phil..do you know her?	No.
2 ...Lily...?	No.
3 She's my love...my life...love of it... In school when you're 12 years old. In school, in six grade....and I saw her and I didn't go to that school...but we met. And my friend knew her...I would say, "What's that girl?"  "How's that Lily?" "Oh, she's a bad girl...she sleeps with guys..."  My friend would say this....but then sometime...I went to another school, you see? But then...when high school at the end, what's that?  What is that?  When you get to the end?	Graduation?
4 No, no, the grade...the grade that you're in?	Twelve.
5 Yeah...So I go to her school for that for grade twelve...and we meet...she was fuckin...like a doll...porcelain doll...and the hips...child bearing hips...y'know that?  So beautiful. But I didn't have sex with anyone, you know?  I was not...I couldn't do anything...always scared, y'know... she was...she had some boyfriends...they liked her y'know...but I didn't like that. I couldn't get over that I wasn't a man, but she was a woman. Y'see?  Y'see I didn't make her feel ok about that....I would say, "How many men you been with?" She told me, I couldn't take it...take that I wasn't a man....because if I hadn't had sex with women...like as many women as she had men...then I was weak...a boy.... But I loved her...you understand? ....well, of course, I wanted to have sex with her...and I did and we were together....we met...age twelve, but then again...age seventeen...something, somethin... I didn't let her forget that I thought she was a bad...a slut.....a slut I would call her and hit her....I hit her for what she did...but we married...Lily and me and we married...but I cheated on her...over and over and over again...because I wanted to be a man and I couldn't let her be a woman...a smart, free person who was something...my mind then, so fuckin' stupid, so fuckin....jesus christ, what would I think...did I think....? ...for what I've done...She's my wife for thirty eight years...I went behind her... over and over...fucking asshole I am that I would go out and fuck and come home and get in her bed and say "I love you..."  This'z Jack's mother. His mother Lily...these two that I had and I lost .... and this is the regret that you make...the regret you make is the something that you take...blah...blah...blah... something, something.....  Gimme a cigarettee?

1 You're hurting a lot of people, Frank --	-- fuck you.

1 I'm here.  I'm here now.  What do you want? Do you want anything?	I don't think, he can't...
2 ...just wait...Dad...you want something...can you say...

1 You look great.	What the fuck is this, Jimmy?
2 ...you know...	Did your wife find out?
3 No.	Then what?
4 It's just...too late for me to be fuckin' around.  I gotta stop. I gotta clean my brain of all the shit I've done that I shouldn't have done --	-- that you shouldn't have done? That you regret, what? This? What's this? Fuck, man, c'mon.  Treat me like an asshole, but treat me like an <u>asshole</u>.
5 I don't wanna have to lie to anyone. I don't want to hurt anyone else, anymore.

1 I don't mean to cry, I'm sorry.	It's okay, Stanley. It's alright.

1 She thinks terrible things that somehow got in her head...that I might have done something.  She said that to me last time...when it was...ten years ago she walked out the door, "You touched me wrong..." "I know that." Some crazy thought in her, in her head...	Did you ever touch her?
2 ...No....

1 We're not going out two days before we set the record, it's not gonna happen.	When they want us done, they'll call in the Harvard S.W.A.T team or some shit.

1 listen...listen to me now, Phil: I'm sorry, sorry I slapped your face. ...because I don't know what I'm doing... ...I don't know how to do this, y'know? You understand?  y'know?  I...I'm...I do things and I fuck up and I fucked up....forgive me, ok? Can you just...	....it's alright....
2 Tell him I'm sorry, ok, yes, you do that, now, I'm sorry, tell him, for all the things I've done...I fucked up and I'm sorry.... And I'm Gonna Turn Away And Walk Now And Not Look At Him Not See My Man, My Earl, I'll leave now...and tell him it's ok and I'm ok. The whole thing was ok with me -- and I know.

1 I don't wanna go, I can't do it this time.	-- the fuck are you talking about?

1 ...oh Jesus, what the fuck...?	I'm fine. I'm fine, I just wanna keep playing --
2 Why did you do this?

1 What -- ?	No, stay back!  Stay back!

1 What had you to do with this, Mother?	He is your brother!
2 He is nothing now.

1 Porthos sleeps, and you plot.  Don't you think it's time you told me what it is you are plotting?	Soon enough.  Here we are.

1 Hang himself?!	He's threatened to do it, it's been building up in him for months.
2 We must stop him!	Come now, Athos, if Porthos is determined to end his life, then he will certainly manage to find the opportunity.
3 But -- but --

1 No!  Stop --	I will need you all.  All for one. One for all.
2 You -- You cannot ask me to betray my king!  I have sworn to him!

1 Where are we?	Jesus of Nazareth found the holy among the profane.  If we are to have a place of private prayer, where better than here, beside the channels where the shit and the garbage run to the river?

1 Aramis... These are... these are whores!	So was Mary Magdalene, and our Lord loved her.
2 Did she have tits like that?

1 What choice is there?  If Phillippe is in the Bastille, then to the Bastille we will go.	You are right.  But it is a trap.
2 So what?  I'd rather die covered in blood, than an old man, lying in my own piss.

1 This cannot be.  Everyone knows the Queen Mother is a recluse, and the ladies-in-waiting are but mistresses for the king!	If the young woman truly loves Raoul --
2 She's a woman, d'Artagnan!  From a poor family.  You may still be young enough to believe love conquers everything, but I am old and hard and I've seen too much.  Even when kings are hunchbacks they have any woman they desire, because power seduces even more than love!

1 You look so sad.  Is it something I have done?	It is something I have done -- or did not do.
2 What is that?	I did not share beauty with someone... who is no longer here for me to share beauty with.

1 The old man and woman called me... Phillippe.	Phillippe.  Rest now.

1 I was told this impostor was dead!	... You knew you had a double?
2 He is my brother.

1 You've... memorized...?	What was the end page?

1 Ah yes, the riots.  We have food stocks on the wharves right now, no?	That food has spoiled.  That is why it was not shipped to the army.
2 Exactly why it should be given away.	What... an excellent idea, your Majesty!

1 Captain Doyle?	Yeah?

1 You can cut the shit, asshole--	we've got kidnapping, grand theft auto, burglary, and two counts of murder on you, and I'm gonna see to it personally that it sticks!

1 If you can trail him to a remote area do it. We all want a piece of him but let's keep our heads and stay within the law - we got people everywhere out here.	These crowds are going to make it a bitch!
2 I'm sure you can handle it.  Now I want to do an alley-to alley sweep beginning at the north and south ends from Marine to 30th.  Foot beat units continue on the boardwalk.

1 Anyhow... you wake up and she's gone. But--  --this is my favorite part--  she leaves you the keys to a brand new Beemer.	She stole my car!!

1 Vice...you think they had something to do with this dead hooker?	Could explain why Fleming was there.

1 You always carry a gun with you?	No.
2 Only on dates?

1 Operator, I'd like to make a collect call - 213-467-0972...	This is Tubbs. Sorry I can't answer the phone, I'm out square dancing. Leave a message--

1 OK...county tax records...they're saying 1490 Breckinridge is owned by... an Atlantic Trust Corporation...they have a P.O. box in D.C.	How about Marvosa and the others?
2 I'll access the LAPD mainframe, but we gotta be careful - that one's kind of tricky -

1 Where did you learn to fight like that? JIM  I read a book.	Well, you saved me from a bad situation. Thanks.  I admit this is...unusual.
2 Are you a regular there?	Are you serious?  My boyfriend ditched me...
3 Ditched you?	We were fighting - I told him to let me out.  So where are you headed?
4 Bartender said there are motels south of here.

1 Sidney: I don't understand him.  We know he re-arranges the kids and husbands into a dead audience.  To witness the act. We know he thinks the act is making him into something different. His 'becoming'... but I don't know what it is he thinks he's becoming.  The answer is something to do with how he uses the mirrors. That's what's missing for me.  Why the mirrors?	The usual motivation doesn't apply to him, nor the way he uses them.  I don't have an answer for you.  Listen to me, my friend: leave this.
2 And do what? Read about the next family in the morning paper?  In my Monkey Ward safehouse 'cause I can't take my family home?  This ends when I make it over.	How are Molly and the boy?
3 Kevin and Molly are on their way to Montana.  Who the hell is he to do this to my family, Sidney? Answer me that...!

1 This is Chester here. Who am I talking to?	Will Graham, Jack Crawford...
2 We got an ad order in tonight's "Tattler" with 'six-six-six' in it. It's being Telexed to you right now.	Read it.
3 'Dear Pilgrim, you honor me.'	That's it. Lecktor called him a Pilgrim when he was talking to me...
4 'You're very beautiful.

1 ...snuck in the hospital while I was sedated, flipped back the sheets and shot pictures. The only decent thing he did was run a black square over my balls...	I know...

1 Who is it?	Will, Bowman just broke the code. It was a James Beard cook book. You need to know what it says right now.
2 What'd it say?	I'll tell you in a second. Now listen to me: everything is okay, I'm taking care of it, so stay on the phone when I tell you.
3 Tell me now.	It says: 'Graham home, 3860 DeSoto Highway, Marathon, Florida. Save yourself. Kill them all.  It's your home address, Will. The bastard gave him your home address.
4 Get me a plane...	Wait, Will...
5 Get me a plane!	I'll pick you up in...
6 I won't be here.

1 What it's going to say on the Jacobi film can is the same as it says on the Leeds' film can: Gateway Lab, St. Louis, Missouri.	Is there a label on the Jacobi can that says what lab processed it?

1 Where the hell's Graham!	He went to the men's room.
2 For Christ's sake get him!

1 You worked out well.	You know you speak very well, although you avoid fricatives and sibilants in your speech. At the Riker Institute for the Blind. I trained in speech therapy for speech and hearing impaired children...

1 Two groups of people were changed. Leeds and Jacobi. The police think they were murdered.  Do you know what they call the being that visited these people?  You can say.	The Tooth...

1 Do you see?	Yes.

1 I want to see Lecktor now.	Uh... sure...

1 Our people swear he wore surgeons' gloves the whole time. They dusted everything.	The report didn't mention nails and eyes.
2 Why do you think he took his gloves off?	Mrs. Leeds was a good-looking woman. I'd want to touch her skin in an intimate situation, wouldn't you?
3 'Intimate? !"	Yes. 'Intimate.' They had privacy.  Everybody else was dead.

1 ...sorry, Molly. I'm sorry this happened to you.	You didn't do it to me, Will; it's happened to us.  And if I survive the wallpaper we'll be okay...  He's after you now, isn't he?

1 It's Will Graham. Is Molly there, Mr. Swenson?	Well, how you doin', Mr. Graham?! You sure are in the center of a storm. Burning up lots of taxpayer's dollars, too, I bet.  On the news they said he was a white man. He isn't really, is he?
2 Sure he is. Blond.  Probably Scandinavian, too...	You going back down to Florida after?
3 Yes. Is Molly there?	My grandboy's been eatin' a ton of breakfast every day. Been out riding. Must be the good air. You oughta see that little booger eat.  I'll bet he's gained ten pounds.  Molly's out in the motor home...
4 I know... 'Out in the good air...'	What's that?
5 Tell her I called.

1 That's the same atrocious aftershave you wore in court three years ago.	I keep getting it for Christmas.

1 Glaser Safety Slugs?	...commercially prohibited.  Number Twelve shot in liquid Teflon in a copper casing. On impact it all opens up in the target. Expect the recoil. They're hot loads.  Body armor?
2 Kevlar Second Chance.	I hope you have a second chance...
3 Because he's gone for the head shot seven out of eight times'	You got it.
4 Let's walk the route.

1 Okay.  Fine, I'll do it.  But I have a few terms.	Of course!  That's what negotiations are for.

1 I'm here with Ed over at Taxi. There's been some trouble with Tony.	Oh no!  Did he get hurt?

1 The world thinks Andy Kaufman sucks. So I was just giving 'em what they want...	Andy, they don't think you suck. They've just... lost a reason to love you.

1 So, Mr. Besserman, same slot tomorrow...?	Eh, I dunno... Andy.  I'm... thinkin' of letting you go...
2 You're firing me??  You don't even pay me!	Look -- I don't wanna seem insulting.  But... your act is like amateur hour: Singalongs... puppets... playing records...

1 Right...	Okay, great!  So let's reset!

1 Why did you call me?  The last person I ever expected to get a call from was you.	Gosh.  Gee, Lynne... I was just so impressed with your wrestling moves. EXT. MOVIE THEATER - DAY

1 Is this an act -- or are you addicted to causing trouble??	I can shtop whenever I want...

1 Hey Andy, good show.	Oh George, this is Bob Zmuda.  Bob and I have been buddies for years.

1 This is great.  The crowd's gonna love this!  Hey... do you still think any of those cowgirls are still alive?	I dunno.  If they were, they'd be pushin' 80.
2 Well, call SAG.  It'd be cool to get one on the show.  I want the evening to build and build.  It's gonna have the most incredible ending: Singers, dancers, the "Hallelujah Chorus" -- then the sky opens, and Santa Claus comes flying down!	And you say, "Santa, what am I gettin' for Christmas?"  And he says, "Cancer!"
3 No!  NO NO NO!  None of that!  I want this show to be positive!

1 Gene, you misunderstood!!  You're not getting BOTH of them!  It's physically impossible!	Why's that?  You said over and over and over, Tony Clifton is not Andy Kaufman --
2 Yeah, I KNOW what I said!  But -- trust me, it's not gonna happen!	Sure it is.  Tony called me himself. He yelled at me, insisting that his dressing room be bigger than Andy's. They're both going on tonight, believe me!

1 Why...?  Andy, why...?	I used to think you were original.

1 Sure...	What's your name?
2 Bob.	"Bob"?  BOB!  Bob bob bob.  Bob what?
3 Bob Gorsky.	"Gorsky"?  What is that, Polish?
4 Yes.

1 I sent two units.  They're bringing her down now.	No, Lieutenant, your men are already dead.

1 You weren't supposed to relieve me.	I know but I felt like taking a shift.

1 Goddamn you, Cypher!	Don't hate me, Trinity.  I'm just the messenger.  And right now I'm going to prove it to you.

1 There was an accident.  A fucking car accident.  All of a sudden. Boom.  Jesus, someone's going to make a believer out of me.	I got you.
2 Just get me outta here.	Nearest exit is Franklin and Erie. An old appliance store.

1 Morpheus...	I've been looking for you, Neo.  I don't know if you're ready to see what I want to show you, but unfortunately, we have run out of time.  They're coming for you, Neo. And I'm not sure what they're going to do.
2 Who's coming for me?	Stand up and see for yourself.
3 Right now?	Yes.  Now.

1 I imagine, right now, you must be feeling a bit like Alice, tumbling down the rabbit hole?	You could say that.
2 I can see it in your eyes.  You have the look of a man who accepts what he sees because he is expecting to wake up.

1 Right now, we're inside a computer program?	Wild, isn't it?

1 If you are killed in the Matrix, you die here?	The body cannot live without the mind.

1 No.  No!  Morpheus!  Don't!	Trinity!  Go!  Get to the basement. Find the catch basin!

1 That vase.	Shit, I'm sorry.

1 It's the question that brought you here.  You know the question just as I did.  It is a hacker's question.	What is the Matrix?
2 When I asked him, he said that no one could ever be told the answer to that question.  They have to see it to believe it.

1 Did you go to her?	Yes.
2 What did she tell you?	She told me...

1 No, you... have to be.	I'm sorry, I'm not.  I'm just another guy.  Morpheus is the one that matters.
2 No, Neo.  That's not true.  It can't be true.	Why?
3 Because...

1 See who?	The Oracle.

1 Yes.  They're moving him.  I don't know where yet.	He's alive.

1 What are your plans?	Well, we're here for about two weeks, then whatever else comes along... we're still working on our album and...
2 Great...great...listen, I'm very interested in you guys because I'll be opening a new club myself soon... uptown...and maybe we can work something out...	Sounds good.
3 Of course, 'The Season of the Witch' won't be ready for a while yet but we have to keep in touch.

1 Well, we want good stuff.	Well, my stuff comes from Maryland... you know what that means?

1 May God be with you.	'And with your spirit.'
2 Salute!!!

1 Panther...	Panther!  Same thing...
2 Hey...no more good times like before.  Until you come back.	Sure.  And you're gonna take the vows next Tuesday, right.
3 Yeah, I'm gonna worry about you, too.

1 You'd better make a move kid.  He thinks you're trying to screw him.	Wouldn't bother me.
2 Yeah, big man...get yourself in more trouble.  You make a fool out of him, you're doing the same to me. I signed for you don't forget.	Don't worry.  I can handle it.

1 Shut up!	Yeah, Teresa, shut up!  We don't wanna get Charlie here in trouble, do we?...We love Charlie.

1 I think we should see your uncle.	No.
2 This can't be settled any other way now...I'll take full blame.	Forget it.

1 I don't know that.  That's what I'm telling you.	Michael, believe me.  You know the kid's a little crazy sometimes.  I vouched for him and he'll come through.  I promise.  I'll talk to him and straighten him out.  Don't worry, OK?
2 OK.

1 Be seeing you and Johnny tonight... here...right?	We'll be here.

1 Take a drink!	Ok.

1 Wasn't a book...was a short story.	What was it?
2 Nothing.	No, c'mon...Y'know, I read.
3 "Francis Macomber."	Wha?
4 "Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber."	Oh yeah...didn't read it but I saw the movie...Gregory Peck...pretty good.

1 Bore.	A paper on that one too?
2 Yeah...but don't worry about that now.  The Hemmingway one is first.	It was nothing.  I'm almost finished.
3 Take your time.  I don't care.	I know you don't.  You've been very preoccupied lately.
4 That's the word...preoccupied.

1 Lower the fuckin music--I can't hear nothin.	The girls like it loud.
2 Girls?  You call those skanks girls?!

1 I know what you're going to say but don't say it.  These drinks are all on the tab.  I'm gonna see you this Tuesday payday, I promise.  I give you my word.	You what?

1 Look who's talking.	Yeah, speak for yourself.

1 Daddy.  Does your friend have a name?	A name?

1 What about the Mayor?	He said he would be there with bells on.

1 'Laura Scudder's Peanut Butter'.  You like it?	I would say, sir, it is right up there with Jif and Skippy.  But miles ahead of Peter Pan.  Like a taste?

1 We have an arrangement now.	What side of the industry did you say you were on?
2 I didn't say.	Joe sounds like a ringer, Bill.  I have the feeling you guys got the broad strokes already.  Need any help with the details?

1 No, I don't --	Not good, not bad, you know what we got?  Nothing.  No credit, no cars, no mortgages -- no wives.  Nothing.

1 Sorry...um - you - you know it's gone right out of my head --	What?!

1 I was a little abrupt with you this afternoon, Drew.  Forgive me.  I want you to know I value your advice.	As much as Joe's?

1 I've already introduced Mr. Black to you all.	But who is he?  What are his creden- tials?  What is his relationship to you?

1 I'd like to come, too.  See Susan strut her stuff.	You're on, Quin-cee.  Destination Hospital.  Joe, you'll be the Tour Guide.  Okay?  How's that sound to you?

1 Oh, you come to see Doctor Lady?	Yes.
2 My Doctor Lady?	Mine, too.

1 That's very gracious of you, Quince.	No problem.  I'll leave you two alone.  I can tell you guys have something on the fire --

1 What are your intentions?  To make little dreams in coffee shops, turn a woman's head, and I don't mind admitting it was turned, I liked it, but ten hours later I feel like a fool.  I don't get it.  You, my father, here in this house, the cof- fee shop, it's making me upset, and I don't like being upset.  Who are you anyway?  And what are you eating?	Peanut butter.

1 I have to go, I'm sorry to say --	Be sorry for nothing.

1 Almost.	I said get out.

1 Did you like making love to me?	I loved it.
2 More than you love peanut butter?	Yes!

1 I - uh --	You want me to wait for you, you'll be back --

1 When you go, I go.	That's the best I can do.  ...but minute-by-minute, I find myself lingering.
2 ...I just saw my doctor, he told me everything was fine.	Your doctor?  Did your doctor say anything about a tiny, undetectable hole in your aorta?  Did he mention an irreparab- ly weak vein in the further reaches of your famous brain?  Were there any prognostications about the possibil- ilites of a fatal collision on a golf cart or suffocating in an avalanche on a ski vacation in Gstaad?
3 No --	I hope you realize, Bill...in your office this morning, that was your time.
4 Closer than that.

1 Perhaps you would like to wait in my office --?	No.
2 What I'm trying to say is this is a Board meeting and you are not a mem- ber of the Board.	I'm sure you'll see to it that it won't be a problem.

1 I thought you'd heard a trillion times --	This part I'm interested in.

1 Yes, I saw you see me.	Well, you're at the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong woman.
2 I'll be the judge of that.	I'm her father!
3 With all due respect, Bill, I'm not asking your permission.	Well, you goddam well should.  You walk into my life, give me the worst news a guy can get, have me dancing on the heads of pins with my busi- ness and with my family, and now you're spooning with my daughter.
4 'Spooning'?	Yes, and stop repeating everything I say, and turning it into a question. Spooning, fooling around, God knows what.  You arrive on the scene -- why you picked me, I still don't under- stand --
5 I picked you for your verve, your excellence, and for your ability to - how shall I say - instruct.  You've lived a first-rate life.  And I find it eminently usable.

1 I don't like what you're saying.	I don't expect you to.
2 Are you threatening me?	I certainly hope so -- I loved Susan from the moment she was born, and I love her now, and every minute in between, and what I dream of is a man who will discover her and she will discover a man who will love her, who is worthy of her, who is of this world, of this time and has the grace and compassion and fortitude to walk beside her as she makes her way through this beautiful thing called life.

1 Yes.	Death!
2 That's me.	You're not Death.  You're just a kid in a jacket and a pair of pants.
3 The jacket and the pair of pants came with the body I took.  Let me ask your opinion.  Do I blend in?

1 Where are you?	I'm here.

1 This one.	The vodka.  What'd I tell you?

1 Good morning, Dad.	Hi, honey.

1 I won't.  And when I tell Drew about it, he won't either.	You won't tell him, and even if you did, he'd clock it and punch it into his laptop in order to pull out some key phrases when he gives the Commencement Speech at Wharton.
2 You're terrible.	I know.  But I'm the only father you've got.

1 I won't say you may be getting onto shaken ground --	Then what will you say?
2 I don't think this is the lightning you are looking for.  Drew's a good man.  I know I didn't seem to be completely in his corner before, but I've come to appreciate --	Now we love Drew and Joe in verbo- ten?  What's going on?
3 Nothing.	When you say 'nothing' that way, it's not nothing.
4 Then what is it?	It's something.

1 But what?	I want you to know how much I love you.  That you've given a meaning to my life that I had no right to expect, and that no one can ever take from me.
2 Daddy --	No -- I love you so much and I want you to promise me something.  I don't want you to ever worry about me.  If anything should happen, I'm going to be fine and everything's going to be all right.  -- And I have no regrets.

1 ...It's kind of a pro bono job.	'Pro bono'.  That means doing good -- Going to be doing good all your life?
2 I know what you're saying.  Doesn't pay very well.  Depends on the woman I marry.  Maybe she'd like a bigger house, a better car, lotsa kids, college doesn't come cheap --	You'd give up what you want for the woman you marry?
3 I would.

1 79.	Not to me! I wasn't fucking married to her!

1 Hiya.	I'm Mr. Shelby from 304.
2 What can I do for you, Leonard?	I'm sorry... um... ?
3 Burt.	Burt, I'm not sure, but I may have asked you to hold my calls -  MEMENTO Blue Revisions - 8/27/99

1 Well, at least you're being honest about cheating me.	Yeah, well you're not gonna remember, anyway.
2 You don't have to be that honest, Burt.	Leonard.

1 You think you can bargain with me?!	Take the money and walk away!
2 I don't want your fucking money!

1 Calm down. You're not into anything. It was my problem, you offered no help. It's got nothing to do with your investigation.	That's the problem! How can I find John G. when I don't know what's going on?! How did you get me into this?!
2 Leonard, you offered to help when you saw what this guy did to me.

1 Me? Why would he be interested in me?	I told him about your car.
2 Why would you do that?	He was beating the crap out of me! I had to tell him something!

1 They're not looking for him.	Why not?

1 I don't know. I'm sorry.	You have no idea where you've just come from? What you've just done?

1 What the hell you want to go there for?	You know it?
2 Yeah, it's just this fucked-up building.      * Why are we going there?	I don't remember.

1 I'm not gonna help you kill this guy, if that's what -	No. No, just let me think for a minute.

1 Why's that?	Because she'll have taken one look at your clothes and your car and started thinking of ways to turn the situation to her advantage. She's already got you staying with her, for fuck's sake. 

1 Envelopes?           *	He knows you're no good on the phone, so      * he calls you up to bullshit you.      * Sometimes you stop taking his calls, so   * he slips something under your door to     * frighten you into answering your phone    * again. He's been pretending to help you.      * Feeding you a line of crap about John G.      * being some local drug dealer.     *
2 How do you know this?	'Cos he fucking told me. He thinks it's funny. He's laughing at you.
3 How do you know him?	I'm a snitch. He's a cop from out of town looking for information. The local boys put us in touch.

1 She wasn't diabetic. You think I don't    * know my own wife? What the fuck is wrong      * with you?       *	I guess I can only make you believe the things you want to be true, huh? Like ol'     * Jimmy down there.
2 But he's not the right guy!       *

1 What was it for?          *	A load of amphetamine I told him I had.

1 ...eliminated one.  SWAT's on the next two...	Trudy and I are goin' for Gina...

1 So...?	Meth precursors and the Dutch party favors are en route.
2 All I want to know is the where and the when.  Spare me mini moves, progress reports and bullshit.	Okay.  You got the "item"?
3 I got the item.	And our friend don't like the rest of the people bringin' the merch to you.
4 How many?	Two main players plus three.
5 My end?	25% discount on the load.
6 Make it 40%.	Make it 35.
7 Deal.

1 Were you born in Havana?	Angola.  My mother was being a surgeon there.  She volunteered. Mozambique and Mali, too...  ...those days, in those days...she was part of Cuba's gift to the third world.  She came from a bourgeois family with a house in Verdado...we still have the house. We will go there...
2 Where's she now?	She's dead...

1 I forgot the napkins.	And the chopsticks and fortune cookies?
2 What's the best fortune you ever got?	They're all the same.  "Financial security is around the corner." "Your friends love you."
3 In Kowloon, once, I got one that said, "Live now because life is dust."

1 What...?	Who you run loads for?  Cause other than Nicholas, you knows you?

1 Proof of life.  How do I know Mrs. Rico's alive?	'Cause she will tell you.

1 And specialize in very fast go-fast boats for coastal runs.	What kind of weight?

1 Where'd you go?	Hit a couple of jazz clubs.  Fell back to her place.
2 Where?	Verdado.
3 Verdado where?	It's in the suburbs outside Havana.
4 Havana, Cuba...?	No.  Havana, Louisiana.  Don't we have a meet?
5 ...where you're makin' a move on the wife of Archangel de Jesus Montoya?	No.
6 You're not makin' a move on her...?	We're makin' moves on each other.
7 Oh, that makes it okay, then.

1 Hello?	This is Agent James Fujima.
2 Detective Crockett.	What's your Miami PD badge number?
3 4-4-7 Charlie 12-92.	Okay.  What's up?
4 A C.I. we cut loose to your Joint Interagency Task Force.  Name of Alonzo Stevens.  Now, he's YOUR informant.  Stevens, called us.  I haven't spoken to him for six months. I do not know what case you have him on.  I do not know what he is talking about.  But whatever he is doing for you, it sounds like it is going bad.  Right now...	How do I discuss operations over an open line?
5 How do I know?  I got the call from Alonzo on an open line.  That is the hand we have been dealt at this moment, at eleven-forty-seven o'clock Friday night.  Okay?  I am trying to alert you, here.  <u>You</u> know whether or not...you have a thing goin' down.  I do not.  But we know this guy.  I think you know this guy.  Normally, he is cool.  Tonight he is distraught. That is atypical.  That engenders foreboding.  Do you understand the meaning of the word "foreboding"? As in badness is happening to <u>your</u> deal right fucking now?

1 This I gotta see...  ...the "make up an excuse and stop" part.	Have faith.
2 I have faith.  In horoscopes and fortune cookies...

1 C'mon, man!	We think NLR.  We don't know! Alonzo only fronted as a broker for our guys to make the meet.  He wasn't deep into the crew.

1 Okay.	Good idea.  We'll grab a bite.

1 That sonofabitch!	You set this up!
2 Of course!  That is why I placed myself here, with you, knowing Yero would pull this crap.

1 Transshipment point is here at 17:00 hours on the 23rd.	Uh-uh.  No predetermined places and times to meet.  Give me their heading and radio codes and I will talk to them directly with the longs and lats and time which will be a last minute deal...
2 <u>You</u> give <u>yours</u> to me.  <u>We</u> position all the assets hauling our loads...

1 Were you looking? About the Statue of Liberty?	Joking? No, ma'am. Oh no! I mean business!
2 I'm sorry. I thought you were -- never mind -- I've never actually been there, but let me see, you take the Seventh Avenue subway, I think, to the end of the line...	You sure are a pretty lady.

1 That is one hell of a shirt. I bet you paid a pretty price for it, am I right?	Oh, it ain't cheap. I mean, yeah, I'd say this was an all right shirt. Don't like to, uh, you know, have a lot of cheap stuff on my back.

1 Smart thing for me to do is haul ass outta here.	Whatsa matter now?

1 Look at yourself, Joe, no offense, but frankly, you're beginning to smell. For a stud in this town that's a handicap.	You talk like a man with a tin twat.

1 You got a comb?	Don't need a comb.
2 Few dozen cooties won't kill me, don't guess.

1 Hey -- whatsa matter?	I'm wet.
2 You're what?	I wet my pants! My seat's all wet.
3 Hell, don't cry about it!	Here I am going to Florida and my leg hurts, my butt hurts, my chest hurts, my face hurts, and like that ain't enough, I gotta pee all over myself.

1 I'm lonesome. I'm lonesome so I'm a drunk. I'm lonesome so I'm a dope fiend. I'm lonesome so I'm a thief, a fornicator, a whore-monger. Poop, I say, poop! I've heard it all and I'm sick of it, sick to death.	Yessir, I can see that.
2 Lonesomeness is something you take. You bear? Dammit, you take it and go about your business, that's all.	Well, uh, I'm raring to go.
3 Yes, I believe you are. Cowboy, huh?	Uh, yessir.
4 Ready for hard work, son?	Ready for anything.
5 I got a hunch, Joe Buck, it's gonna be easier for you than most.	Gonna be like money from home.
6 Money from home, see, there's your strength, you put things in earthy terms any man can understand, son. I warn you I'm gonna use you, I'm gonna run you ragged!

1 Yeah.	History, man, history. How much?
2 Two kilos.	Where?
3 The airport. Trying to get on the plane for the States.	Could be ten or fifteen.  Maybe even twenty.
4 Twenty months?	Twenty fucking YEARS, man - YEARS! I figger ten at the least.

1 To what?	The prison, man. There was this German cat an architect in the hospital. He was helping the Turks build some shit round the place. I laid some bread on him and he let me copy them.

1 Why'd you do it, Billy?	For the money... )
2 I know you kids smoke that stuff, and we drink booze, but taking it across a border - it was stupid, Billy. Stupid.	I know.

1 How much you pay this joker... this cab driver?	Two hundred dollars. It was my last two hundred.
2 How much did you figure to make?

1 And you?	Hashish.  Ninety percent of the foreigners are in for hashish.

1 Best way is get your ass out... any... way... you can...	What do you mean?
2 Get the... midnight... express.	What's that?

1 Yeah I got it all worked out. Billy, listen to me.  That old guard likes you, You drop some acid on him.  When he's Seeing rainbows yer know. walk out - tonight.	Then we're outside the kogus. Then what?
2 What?	After we're outside the kogus?
3 Oh we... we...	Max... Your BILLY shirt's on fire...

1 Billy, what's the matter?	My passport!
2 No!

1 Lawyers?	Yeah... there's no straight lawyers in Turkey... They're all bent bent as hairpins...

1 You all watch your step.  We got some burrows goin' down seven stories here.  You fall, I don't wanna have to come pick you up.	New York's finest.

1 Oh, that's gonna work.	You got a better way up?

1 Can we get this car there?	Someone'd have to go to the switchroom, pull the coupling lever, that'll send us left and to the elevator.

1 But the power...	Hell, I might be able to juice the whole area, if I can get to the power box. It's just a couple of cables...

1 We did no impact evaluation.  The consequences of...	Is this a Catholic guilt thing...?

1 Honey, just leave it.	No, there's...

1 Don't.	Listen to me:  we're getting you out.

1 You go first. I'll be right below you.	Your arm, you can't...
2 I can.  We can do this...

1 I'm gonna pull it out and I want you to pin it down, okay?	What is it?
2 I have no idea.  Are you ready?

1 Thanks, Miz Wilkes, but I don't want to take up any more of your time. I best be going.	But you didn't even taste your cocoa.

1 What's your new book called?	I don't have a title yet.
2 What's it about?	It's crazy, but I don't really know, I mean I haven't written anything but "Misery" for so long that--you read it you can tell me what you think it's about. Maybe you can come up with a title.
3 Oh, like I could do that?

1 I just kept reading them over and over. I know when I finish this one-- and I've only got two chapters to go-- I'll just turn right to the front page and start reading it again.	I'm...
2 Done?	Yeah, thanks.
3 No problem.

1 See, isn't this nice?	Great. I've always wanted to visit the other side of the room.
2 And look what I've got for you. An electric razor so you can shave yourself now.	If I knew this was gonna be the surprise, you could've gotten me to burn all my books.
3 Now don't josh. This is a very big day for you, Paul. Here. You just sit tight, and I'll set everything up.

1 "HE DIDN'T GET OUT OF THE COCKADOODIE CAR!"	They always cheated like that in cliff--  --chapter plays.
2 But not you. Not with my Misery. Remember, Ian did ride for Dr. Cleary at the end of the last book, but his horse fell jumping that fence and Ian broke his shoulder and his ribs and lay there all night in the ditch so he never reached the doctor, so there couldn't have been any "experimental blood transfusion" that saved her life. Misery was buried in the ground at the end, Paul, so you'll have to start there.

1 Annie, I think we should have a toast.	A toast?
2 Yes, to Misery. Let me pour you some more wine.

1 Paul, don't you think it's time for you to start writing again? It's been over a week.	I don't know, it's weird, but a couple of broken bones hasn't done a lot for my creative juices. Get the fuck out of here.
2 Don't talk to me like that.	Why, what are you going to do?  Kill me? Take your best shot.
3 Why are you so mean, Mister you'd-be- dead-in-the-snow-if-it-wasn't-for- me?	Oh, no reason, you keep me prisoner, you make me burn my book, you drive a sledgehammer into my ankles...
4 I'll drive a sledgehammer into your man-gland if you're not nicer--	Be my guest.
5 That's disgusting.

1 Stop--stop right here.	What? What is it?

1 No, no, of course not. It's just that his daughter hasn't heard from him, and when he's got a book coming out, he usually keeps in touch. So when there was no word from him...	You think he might be missing?
2 I hate that I made this call--tell me I'm being silly.

1 - pull the NO2 tank and dump it, it's potential evidence..	All done, chief..
2 - right -  - don't go too far ahead of me now -	Not possible..

1 Won't do, love.  It's not spring.  It's nearly autumn..You're in Oz.  everything's upside down and backwards here.	Maybe that's it, then.  Everything's upside down and backwards...

1 Outrageous.  I won't let you take control of my company.	Sit down.  You'll be a billionaire.  Better than being broke.  I've got terrorists and other pharmaceutical companies standing in line.  Ball's in your court, Mr. McCloy.

1 Damn.  Just when it was about to get interesting.	It's okay.  She scrambled the transmission.  Luther, continue feeding the GPS her position.

1 Before we kill her or cure her..	Right.

1 Look, it's either you or the rent and I don't mind telling you it's not an easy choice.	What if I pay the rent?
2 Uh-huh.	Uh-huh?

1 Pull over and listen to me, will you? Just listen..	Listen to what?
2 I need your help and I thin you can use mine.	Your help?  What are you talking about?
3 Scotland Yard, Interpol, every Dutch authority.  I can make them go away.	Oh bloody hell.  You're a spy.

1 Go and insinuate yourself back into Sean's life.	I'd like a little more conviction..
2 So would I.  But it's not mine to give.	You've either got it or you don't.  Let your conscience be your guide?
3 Something like that.

1 I managed.	You noticed.  What're you going to do? Spank me?

1 Sorry I didn't let you know where I was.	Don't be.  Wouldn't be on vacation if you did.
2 Well.  You're sorry and I'm sorry.	Why did you phrase it like that?
3 Like what?	'You're sorry and I'm sorry.'
4 You gotta be kidding.

1 - good.  Then if you manage to get hold of Ambrose, and obtain what he's got, you've got -  - 8 hours 57 minutes and twenty-three seconds to destroy the largest remaining source of Chimera on earth.	She sacrificed herself..
2 Brave girl.  If you can get hold of Bellerophon with the time limit, you may spare her the ultimate sacrifice.  But in either case you've got less than nine hours to kill her or cure her.  After that it's out of our hands and a matter of worldwide material law.  And Hunt.  However you obtain it, we want you to preserve a sample of Chimera.  Bring it back alive.

1 Luther..get us everything you can on the outbreak of influenza on Bruny Island last month, including photos of the victims.	Right.  I guess there aren't many flu epidemics in the middle of summer.

1 Ethan, I keep telling you there's not a chance of locating Nyah til I access the satellite and there's not a chance of doing that til I get this thing booted up and running!  How much time does she have left?	Ninety-seven minutes, twenty-seven seconds.

1 The man's gone black, Barnes.  He's under until he decides to surface.	Look we can use someone from the Embassy and we can get the local authorities involved. Close off his transportation.
2 What can we do, Barnes?  Put a guy at the airport?  How many identities do you think Hunt has?  How many times has he slipped past custom, in how many countries?  These guys are trained to be ghosts.  <u>We</u> taught them how to do it, for Christ's sake!	So what do you suggest?
3 Let's not waste time chasing him.  Make him come to us.  Everybodys got pressure points.  Find out something that's important to him personally and you squeeze.

1 Dont Jim.	Now we dont have to eliminate him?  You like that, dont you Claire?  Dont you?
2 Yes.

1 Where were you?	I walked away.  He said abort.  He was gone so I walked away.
2 That was four hours ago!  Who sent you? Did they send you here?	Who is "they?"
3 Did they send you...Did they send you?	Who is they, who is they?

1 What are you going to do?	He's expecting my call.  I'm going to the station...  And I'm going to call him.

1 You seem hell bent on blaming yourself, Ethan.	Who else is left?
2 Yes.  I see your point.	Why was there another team?
3 What?	Of IMF agents.  At the Embassy.  Tonight.
4 I don't quite follow you.	Let's see if you can follow me around this room.  The drunk Russians on the embankment at 7 and 8 o'clock...The couple waltzing around me at the Embassy at 9 and 11. The waiter behind Hannah at the top of the staircase - Bowtie, 12 o'clock. The other IMF team.  You're worried about me. <u>Why</u>?
5 You're right.  Maybe this'll save some time.

1 Reach your folks?  How they feeling?	About what?
2 The official apology from the Justice Department, the VIP treatment, you know, the whole nine yards.	Well my Mother was a little confused about how the DEA could mistake her and Uncle Donald for a couple of dope smugglers in the Florida keys.

1 Merci.	We're not outta here yet.

1 Higher.  Higher.	Higher.
2 Right, right.  Good.

1 You're going to use Walter?	He's our guy.
2 Isn't he chairing the Armed Services hearing?	Not this week. This week he's flyfishing at the Oughterard Slough in County Kildare, with one of our best Irish guides.
3 He won't be back in a hurry?	No, not in a hurry.  What do you think? You think the plot'll work?
4 Sure.  If the main character does.	If you were me, Ethan, who would <u>you</u> trust to make him believable?

1 - no.  She cant know about me.  No one can.  Not til this is over.  Theres too much at stake, Ethan.	Youre probably right.
2 I usually am.	Once we leave the safehouse, get in there and crash.  Ill call you from Paris.
3 You got it.	And get a doctor.
4 Good luck.

1 Thirty-two and change.	Doesn't mean it's a signal.  Could just be the hard drive heating up.

1 I don't like him.	You're not gonna marry him, Cosmo. Do you love him, Loretta?

1 Rose, pass the wine.	I never seen anybody so in love like Cosmo back then! He'd stand outside the house all day and look in the windows. I never told you this cause it's not really a story. But one time I woke up in the middle of the night cause this bright light was in my face. Like a flashlight. I couldn't think a what it was. I looked out the window, and it was the moon! Big as a house! I never seen the moon so big before or since. I was almost scared, like it was gonna crush the house. And I looked down, and standing there in the street was Cosmo, looking up at the windows. This is the funny part. I got mad at you, Cosmo! I thought you brought this big moon over to my house cause you were so in love and woke me up with it. I was half asleep I guess and didn't know no better.
2 You were altogether asleep. You were dreaming.	No. You were there.

1 Why you looking around so much?	I don't know. I got a feeling.
2 I'm wearing your bracelet.

1 Gimme the big knife! I'm gonna cut my throat!	Maybe I should come back another time.
2 No, I want you to see this! I want you to watch me kill myself so you can tell my brother on his wedding day! Chrissy, gimme the big knife!

1 What?	That light.
2 I don't know. I think it's the moon.

1 They get some turnout for this stuff.	It's the best thing there is.
2 I like parts of it, but I don't really get it.

1 You've gotta get outta here.	No. I'm gonna wait.
2 Ronny, please...

1 It's Johnny Cammareri.	Johnny.

1 I'll call you when I get to Mama's house.	You've made me very happy, Johnny.

1 Will you live here?	No.
2 Why not?	Pop don't like Johnny.

1 Hi, Loretta.	Hi. Why ain't you at the store?

1 Maybe I should go?	What are you doing here? You're supposed to be in Palermo.
2 That's what I came to tell Loretta. There's been a miracle.	A miracle. Well, that's news.
3 My mother's recovered.	You're kidding?
4 The breath had almost totally left her body. She was as white as snow. And then she completely pulled back from death and stood up and put on her clothes and began to cook for everyone in the house. The mourners. And me. And herself! She ate a meal that would choke a pig!	That's incredible.
5 Yes.

1 When I was twenty-seven years old, in Jersey City, I asked a woman to marry me. She had red hair. She smelled a jasmine. She wore black shoes with pointy white tips.	What happened?
2 She didn't hear me. She asked me to repeat, so she could understand what I said. But I wouldn't repeat it. Outta shyness. So I'm a bachelor.

1 Good night. Can I kiss you on the cheek, too?	Sure.

1 How do you know she is a witch?	She looks like one. Yes, she does.
2 Bring her forward.

1 Where does he live?  Old man ... where does he live ...	He knows of a cave ... a cave which no man has entered.
2 And ... the Grail ... The Grail is there?

1 What word?	I cannot tell you.  Suffice to say is one of the words the Knights of Ni! cannot hear!
2 How can we not say the word, if you don't tell us what it is?	You said it again!
3 What, "is"?	No, no ... not "is"!

1 Good Sir knight, will you come with me to Camelot, and join our number at the Round Table?	My liege,  I am honored.

1 What?	It's the ... oh ...  it's the ... it's on the tip of my tongue ...

1 Where?	There.
2 Behind the rabbit?	It is the rabbit.
3 ... You silly sod.	What?
4 You got us all worked up.

1 Sorry ...	And don't apologize.  Every time I try to talk to someone it's sorry this and forgive me that and I'm not worthy and ... What are you doing now?
2 I'm averting my eyes, Lord.	Well, don't. |      I really don't know where all this got started. It's like those miserable psalms.  they're so depressing. Now knock it of
3 Yes, Lord.	Right.  Arthur, King of the Britons, you're Knights of the Round Table shall have a task to make them an example in these dark times ...
4 Good idea, O Lord!	Course it's a good idea.

1 That's easy!	Stop! Who approacheth the Bridge of Death Must answer me These questions three! Ere the other side he see!
2 Ask me the questions, Bridgekeeper.  I am not afraid.	What is your name?
3 My name is Sir Robin of Camelot!	What is your quest?
4 To seek the Grail!	What is the capital of Assyria?
5 I don't know that!

1 Did you kill all those guards?	Yes ...  I'm very sorry ...
2 They cost fifty pounds each!	Well, I'm really am most awfully sorry but I ... I can explain everything ...

1 Hurry, brave Sir Launcelot!	Shut up!  You only killed the bride's father - that's all -

1 Well, look er, I ...	What is your name, handsome knight?
2 Er ... Sir Galahad... the Chaste.	Mine is Zoot. Just Zoot  But come.

1 Oh, let me go and have a bit of peril?	No.  It's unhealthy.
2 ... I Bet you're gay.	No, I'm not.

1 Oh!	Don't say that word.

1 So what did Ponsonby do when she started shouting?	I think he nearly ruptured his truss.

1 She'll drop you.  When she's done with you, she'll drop you.	Get out.  Out!

1 No doubt you've heard the rumors.	I take no account of gossip, Your Highness.
2 My concern is for the reputation of the Monarchy.	Of course.
3 I fear the influence he has on her. The man's word is not to be credited. He is an arriviste of the very lowest water.  She's having a bust cast of him.  In Nero Marquino marble.	I see.
4 I would talk to her myself, but she won't listen to me.  She must be persuaded, by someone she respects, to abandon this ridiculous favoritism before a situation develops.	A situation?
5 I don't imagine you frequent the Republican Clubs.  But the fact that neither you nor I are members should not blind us to the significance of their existence.  The Tory Party has always been our party.	I'm flattered you think so.
6 I tell you, if we don't stick together on this, you could find yourself First President's Opposition.  Du Royaum Uni.	Quite.

1 The order of seating at the Upper Servant's table is arranged personally by the Queen herself.	That's a tautology lad.  If you say the Queen arranges something, you've no need to say she's done it personally.  That's understood.

1 She'll be away on Friday between eight o'clock and six in the evening to visit the Grants in Glasalt.  If she's to make the journey there and back in the day she's to have no distractions the night before.  She'll take a light supper alone in her private drawing room and retire early.	She'll need to sign dispatches before she retires.
2 That can wait till the weekend.	There are important papers from --
3 It can wait.  Anything else?

1 You will not be unaware of the threat now posed by Republicanism.	Why do you think I keep her here?
2 Ah, but therein lies the paradox.  It is her very isolation that encourages the malcontents.  The longer she is away, the stronger they become; and who, honestly, can promise security against that?  However many doors you lock, someone will always get in. Even here.

1 If Prince Albert were here today, he'd tell him a thing or two.	Sir Henry is not alone.  They all wish it.  The same people who refused to grant my husband the title of King because he was deemed of insufficient rank--

1 John?	Yes, ma'am?
2 I was told you were in a fight.	Yes, ma'am.
3 Has someone seen to those bruises?	Yes, ma'am.

1 I never thought to be bullied by you, Mr Disraeli.  You, I thought, understood a widow's grief.	Forgive me, ma'am, I cannot speak for the nation, only for myself.  As Prime Minister I confess I miss your presence, but that is only an expression of my own selfish desires and I should not burden you with it.

1 Erysipelas.	Not too protracted, I hope.
2 A few days...  When he heard, the Prince of Wales threw the bust from the window of the Royal Gallery.  It took four hours to gather the fragments.

1 Well?	Mr Brown is unable to attend today.
2 Why?	I believe he is unwell, ma'am.
3 Unwell?	I understand he was in a fight.
4 Has he been hurt?	I believe not, ma'am.  I understand -- he'd had rather too much to drink.

1 Ma'am?	Please tell the Princess, and other signatories to this letter, that the Queen will not be dictated to, or made to alter, in any way, what she has found to answer for her comfort.  Do I make myself clear?
2 Ma'am.

1 We're having some problems with ARCADE...	Yeah, who isn't.

1 Has anyone seen Greg?	He's probably outside.  You know how he is. Gets bored...

1 Can you turn off the game?	I'm in the middle of it...
2 Turn if off!

1 Well?	She thought Benz was at school.

1 You mean we learn the rules...	And beat it at it's own game.
2 You realize that in order to do that, we'd actually have to play the game.	I was afraid you'd say that.

1 You're not coming, Alex.	Yes I am...
2 I know how to do this!  I'm good at these games.  You never play, you'd be nailed in an instant.	And what if something happens to you? Am I suppose to go in after you alone?!
3 No.  If you're smart, you run like hell.

1 Hey, my strength's low.  Look out for Fireflies.	There...

1 Come on.  We'll hit Dante's after school, try the game out, maybe get some dinner.	And then keep on driving?
2 Sure.  Never come back.  Disappear forever.

1 Mom?  You're alive...	Of course I am.
2 But I don't understand...	I miss you so much, Alex.  I want so much to be with you...

1 Cool.	Can you say anything but "cool"?
2 Of course I can.  I can say all sorts of things...

1 You'd better fix this, Ray!!!	I'll speak to someone.
2 And you'd better speak to someone too ... or find yourself another client!! This smells like a set-up to me!  And by the way, Ray, I don't know who these guys are kidding, but every foot of film I've shot is in a vault at the lab that only I can access. No one's getting that film!!

1 It's unbelievable!	I told ya.
2 Wow!	Now I guess you and your Aunt have an understanding. So here's the key and you need anything, just give a holler.  Everybody in this building's pretty much okay with me or they wouldn't be here. If you want, later I'll introduce you around. No hard feelings if you don't, and don't forget the rooftop garden. It's just up the stairs we passed. It's open to all the tenants. You can see the Hollywood sign from there.
3 Oh Coco thank you. Thank you so much.	You got it! See you later honey.

1 Betty Elms?	Yes.
2 I'm Wally Brown. Your Aunt is a very dear friend of mine so it's particularly nice to meet you.	Very pleased to meet you.
3 Come in. I'd like you to meet everyone.

1 Well ... we'll leave her a note.	I'll go with you. She's still got some of my stuff.

1 There's nothing?	Not that I can see.

1 Is everything all right? Is it bad for you that I'm here?	Everything is A-okay, but I've gotta get that sandwich!

1 What's  the matter now?	Nothing... I don't like being out in the open like this.
2 It must be just so pathetic being you. Sure Billy, grab your dog we'll eat in the van.

1 Not here...no thanks.	Not a coke or anything?
2 No ... thanks though... I'll take a cigarette if you have one.	Sure, reach in my shirt pocket there.

1 You have 43 unpaid parking tickets, sir. You have the right to remain silent, anything you say can & will be held.....	What's going on ?
2 Please don't be alarmed, Ma'am.

1 So where does this lead ?	No where. We've got about seven minutes before this thing slams into a concrete wall.
2 So what do we do ?	I'm working on it.
3 Who the hell are you anyway ? What is this place ?	It's called Murderland. It's paid for by First Bank.
4 First Bank ? But how ?	It's a tax write off for John C. McCay.
5 McCay knows ?	Knows ? He watches every "Guest" on tape. This whole place is here for his sick amusement. And no so are we.

1 Just remember, hold your breath as long as you can. Then go right over to that corner. The door will open and go in and up.	Okay.

1 What are you DOING here ?	I work here, remember ?
2 That was eleven years ago.	Well, surprise, surprise, I've been on the payroll for several years now. I still have an office and secretary. No one even batted an eyelash. Do you realize what the high turnover is in a multi corporation bank in New York ?
3 Apparently pretty high, we just got a new CEO last week.	That's a shame.
4 Yeah a real shame.	Well, I'll see you at the next staff party.
5 Bye....

1 That's nice.  I think I lost my wallet.	I'd get out of the water if I were you.
2 Why ?

1 You okay ?	Ow...

1 Hand me the 3/8ths.	Here. Am I ever going to get to run the controls for one these capers ?
2 When I think you're ready.	When will that be ?
3 When you are ready.	Look, you're going to have to start trusting me sometime. I am a trustworthy person.
4 Trust is earned not given away.	RESPECT is earned not given away, trust is given away to anybody.
5 Not down here. I'll start trusting you when I feel there the time is right. It's not personal, it's just survival.	I've been working with you for four years, don't you think that's worthy of at least one turn at the controls ?
6 No.

1 I propose we consider a hostile take over. Perhaps Ol' Bruce is in need of a new job opportunity.	What do you mean sir ?
2 What if we were to put Bruce into the Park as a Guest ?	Sir ?
3 I'll bet that would be the Park run of the century !	Sir, he created the Park. He would know how to circumvent any of the traps.
4 I'm willing to bet that even the creator can't out wit his creation.	What then sir ? What would we do with the park with out Bruce ?
5 Do you think the assistant, what's his name...	John, sir.
6 Yes, do you think he would like a raise and a new position ?	Sir, this is not like firing any employee. We can't predict what will happen.
7 That my boy, is the best part. Life on top of the world is boring... predictable. If I wanted life without chances, I never would have paid for Murderland. Now go. Make a formal proposal and see about the assistant. Find out if it's viable.

1 How long till the drug wears off ?	We should have another fifteen minutes at least.
2 Bruce has just awaken.	What ?????

1 Was that the Old Man ?	Yes. I think he's feeling sick or something.

1 Listen, I was thinking, you know. Would you go, it's I think you're...	Do you want to go out with me ?
2 It's sounds so much better when you say it. I'm semi traditional here, and it's important that I ask. Will you go out with me ?	Yes.
3 Really ? On a date ?	Yes.
4 This is too easy, I mean I had a speech prepared, then I even wore these pants because I could get on my knees to grovel.	As appealing as that sounds...
5 Dinner at my place then ? Say, seven o'clock ?	Sure.

1 Are you okay ?	Fine, fine, I feel like a chicken McNugget.

1 What now ?	I want to go to sleep for about a month.
2 No, idiot. Where do we go now ?	Where are we ?

1 Do you still teach?	No, no, no, I gave it up ten years ago...actually it gave me up.

1 So charge him with something...who's gonna know?	Me, I'll know!

1 Okay, no problem.	Okay thanks, atta girl.

1 You were just having a fight about me. Wouldn't you like to hear my opinion?	Of course.
2 I think that if I'm old enough to accept a new baby, and if I'm old enough to accept a new room, I'm old enough to go to California.	Honey I know it's fun to think about these things but....
3 I already bought a ticket.	What??
4 I used my own money and got a great deal, it's a Q47NR five day fare, which means that I have to change planes in Dallas and stay over a Saturday.

1 Oh, Shell, that's ridiculous, where are my needle nosed pliers?	Listen, if a boy wants to do homework with you, it really means he didn't have nerve to ask you out on a date, so you'll get your homework together and pretend to be studying, and the next thing you know you're ordering pizza and talking about your favorite movie stars.

1 It's okay really, I was just a baby.	I'm sorry, it's just...I've been taking all these seminars to get in touch with my feelings and...sometimes it gets out of hand.

1 She's beautiful.	We performed on the beach one summer...ha...everything went wrong.

1 Is it okay if I drink this?	It's okay with me, hi Kevin.
2 Well if it isn't Vada, the grasshopper girl.

1 Hey Vada. How's your report coming?	Great, I have so much to say, I hardly know where to start.
2 You know I've been re-reading Virginia Woolf, I think she'd be a natural for you, she led a fascinating life.	Thanks, but I think I'm gonna stick to my mom, she led a fascinating life too.
3 I'm sure she did. 

1 I don't mean to alarm you, but I'm getting a nose bleed from the altitude.	Just remember the needle in the haystack.
2 I never did understand that story, did someone find the needle or not?	What difference does it make?
3 A big difference, if someone found it we should keep looking, if they didn't we're just wasting our time.	Oh my gosh, here it is!

1 Look at it this way, however bad I feel, it isn't as bad as becoming extinct in a bottomless pit of tar.	And I thought I was weird.
2 You are weird. Let's just go.	Oh, no wait, I like that you bought me here.

1 Never heard of her.	Montgomery Clift, wait 'till I tell Shelly.
2 Here's Judy Garland!

1 ...umm...Listen, I'm sorry...you had to sacrifice your entire vacation.	Some sacrifices are worth it.
2 You mean...it wasn't that terrible?	I wouldn't say it was terrible...it was...kind of...
3 An adventure?	Part adventure...part miracle.

1 Sounds like you have a fear of commitment, Uncle Phil.	That's ridiculous, I'm...I'm very, umm, what do you call it?
2 Committed?	Committed.
3 So does that mean that you sleep here every night?	Yes, it does.

1 Then you'll be all set.	Sounds like you're very organized.

1 You're Nick's mother?	What, did you think he was raised by a pack of wolves? Don't be misled by the haircut.

1 Ahh, why don't I come in first thing in the morning and you can check out that left blinker for me.	Oh, sure okay.
2 I'll see you then...I look forward to it.

1 Let me hold him.	O.K.

1 Danny?	WHAT?
2 Okay, I know you've suffered a terrible loss, and there's really nothing anyone can do to comfort you, but I urge you to focus on the times you had with the camper, the trips you took, the sights you saw, those days are gone now, but they'll live on in your heart forever.	This guy bonking you?

1 It's still available I hope?	I think it's still available.
2 I'm a licensed cosmetologist, I worked for two years, at the &quot;Dino Raphael&quot; Salon, all my customers cried when I told them I was leaving.	Uhh, Miss devoto...
3 I have a wonderful disposition, I put people right at ease.	Uhh, Miss devoto, these people are already at ease. This is not a Beauty Parlor, it's a Funeral Parlor.
4 They're dead?	Yes they are.
5 Stiffs??	Deceased.
6 The add just said &quot;Makeup Artist&quot;

1 I just had a terrible thought Harry.	What's that?
2 I'm gonna be putting makeup on some of these people very soon.	Why d'you think these seats were empty.

1 Do you want to?	Want to what?
2 Kiss me.	Yes.
3 Good.

1 Can we see it from the back yard?	You can get the general idea...

1 Of course not.	Then who's it for?

1 Yes..	Hey guess what? We're going to the carnival tonight, be ready to go in 10 minutes.

1 Well well well, what's going on in here?	Nothing, I'm dressing.
2 Oh, you're dressing, uh huh, Harry Harry Harry Harry, don't you know it's not nice to lie to your big brother?

1 Who's that?	That's Suzanne.  She and I are gonna be married this Fall.

1 He's allergic to everything.	Chocolate?

1 Are you going out somewhere?	No.
2 So how come you're putting lipstick on?	A girl's always gotta look her best.
3 I think lipstick looks fake, no-ones lips are that color.	Have you ever tried any?
4 No.	Come here, sit down.

1 Daddy??!?!?!	Vada, Vada, what's the matter?
2 Where's Daddy?	Well he just left, what's wrong?
3 I'm hemorrhaging.	What do you mean you're hemorrhaging?
4 I don't want, I don't need your help....

1 I knew he wouldn't come.	I can't, I have to go home.

1 Hmmmm, interesting.	What?
2 You have no personality.	Hey, where does it say that?
3 Never mind.

1 Run faster they're after us!!	I am running faster!!
2 Hurry!!!

1 Like this?	Uh huh.  Okay, enough practice.
2 Close your eyes.	But then I won't be able to see anything.

1 Stay, huh?	I honestly wish I could...
2 I'll call George's parents. Tell them I need a best man who actually looks after me.

1 Whenever George tells someone how steadfast I am, he always makes me sound boring.	Solid and genuine is not boring. Michael can be completely insane...

1 You flew all the way h...	I noticed.  I'm on the noon back. We have this thing with George's family in the Hamptons.
2 You're butting in.

1 How do you know you can touch that plug? Are you a licensed contractor?	What do you suggest?

1 Excuse me?	I can be quick.  I can even be funny.

1 I'm excited Sports Illustrated gave him this kind of shot, he's only there a ye...	So your honeymoon is exactly where?

1 About Michael's job.	Oh, that.  I forgot I even said th...
2 I just think you're wrong, is all.	Probably am.  Forget I brought it up.

1 Look at all this beautiful food, so lovingly prepared...	They'll eat it anyway, you ever been to a walk?

1 Ex-cuse me?	I had this crank call?  From some guy who thinks he saw her? I said, what would a bride be doin', on her wedding...
2 You are <u<so right.  What a nerve on that guy!  Bring my dress to church, huh?

1 I haven't caused... a problem, have I?	Nobody has.  So far.

1 What's the sec...	Mirrors.

1 Should I whistle down a cab?	Hey, cabs are expensive.  I'm cheap, remember?

1 No problem.  A little bullshit about Daddy's "needs," and presto, I'm a lap dog in high society.	Michael, it sounds like a wonderful opportun...
2 Does it, really? How come you never took some sell-out establishment job? You had plenty of chances!

1 I can hardly wait for your wedding.	Me either.

1 I forgot how cute you look.  When you get impossible.	It's just... up there... right in front of Walter's... y'know, computer. If memory serves.

1 Should we take a walk?  Or maybe some food sent up, or something...	I just want to be alone.  Is that okay?

1 Jules, what's wrong...	This is the dumbest thing I will ever do.  So dumb, in fact, that I can't.  I don't think.

1 The kiss.  May be hard.  For you to explain.  Because the only fear she really has, is...	... me, yeah.  And she likes Tommy Lasorda.  Case closed.

1 What a sweet little picture.  Mommy and Daddy aren't losing a daughter, they're gaining a eunuch!	Well, if that's the way you f...
2 Damn straight, it's how I feel! What's their wedding gift, a little gold collar that says "Mikey-poo"? Or do I have to change my name to "Binky"?

1 You're from out of town?	Yes. I'm cutting a record.
2 We have a Bible study meeting tonight if you'd like to come.	Is there food?
3 No.	Well, I just wondered 'cause being from out or town I wouldn't be able to make anything.
4 No, those are socials you're thinking of... Saturday's usually.

1 It's fine. We were just talking about Vitamin S.	I'll go on. Ester'1l be very glad.
2 You remember what I said about the Vitamins.

1 How is she?	A little slow, but she'll be fine.
2 Have you talked to Triplette?	Who the hell is he?
3 He's lining up talent for Hal Phillip Walker.	Who the hell is he?
4 He's going to run for president.	Third party?
5 He has that sign with the tree.	What does he want?
6 Barbara Jean.	What!
7 That's what he wants.	You know better than that.
8 It's on National television, Barnett.	I don't care. She's always been neutral in politics and that's not going to change.

1 President?	When is it?

1 Sorry to bother you, Bud.	Yes, sir. Like you to meet Opal.

1 What?	Your wire Ester - she passed away.

1 Well, I could use one, especially if I'm pregnant.	What did you say?
2 I said, maybe I'll change my name again.	I see... Well, those doctors are real miracle workers.
3 But not unless Nashville really inspires me.	Maybe you can look after me a little.
4 That Tom sure is cute.

1 Okay. I'll be talking to you.	Keep warm, dear. Let me hear from you.
2 Bye.	Bye.

1 When did you think it would happen?	I'm not sure.
2 I knew when I first met you.	Oh.

1 I can only give you fifty a week here and ten bucks for the benefit.	Money's no object.

1 How's your stomach?	Pretty good. Sure was surprised to hear from you. You talk to Bill?
2 Not yet. Listen, Norman, I want...	They're looking all over for you. Do you have a copy of the album.

1 No -- That's exercises. My coach says you have to do exercise because the vocal chords are muscle and need to be stretched. Every time you stretch them, the middle part sets stronger. That's the place where I sing.	You think I got any kind of a voice?

1 Thank you. Grace, there is one other thing...	What...

1 Why are Mickey and Mallory being moved to an asylum? And who made the decision?	The prison board made the decision. A board of which I belong. We're the who. The why is simple. Mickey and Mallory are mentally ill and need to be under a doctor's care, where hopefully they'll receive the help they need.
2 Mickey and Mallory were deemed competent in a mental examination before their trial. I'm confused. What's changed?	Well, since that time, they've killed one person during their trail. And since their incarceration, they've killed one psychologist along with several guards and inmates.
3 When they were found competent before, they had already killed fifty people. Other than the fact they're a disciplinary problem, which frankly shouldn't surprise anyone, I still don't see where this situation is any different then it was before. So, I ask you again, Mr. McClusky, what's changed?	What's changed, Mr. Gayle, is our minds. We felt they were competent a year ago. A year has passed, sir, a year where they were under close observation, day in and day out, and their behaviour has led us to believe we were wrong.
4 Who is we?	The prison board and the doctors who examined them.
5 Were any of the doctors who made the first evaluation on the Knoxs mental state asked to re-examine them?	Using the same doctors is not common practice.
6 I take it by your answer it was a whole new team?	Now that you bring it up, yes. They were different men. I hadn't really thought that much about it. Since many psychiatric opinions are, by a rule, sought out for this kind of situation. What do you think normally happens? The Knoxs are assigned a family psychologist that takes care of them throughout the rest of their lives? The state doesn't work like that.

1 Okay, buddy boy, where ya keepin' Mallory? I know she's still here, and I know you know where. So, start talking or my first work as a director will be your death scene.	She's in the holding cell, on this floor.
2 You're taking us to that holding cell now.  All right, Cut!

1 My problem Mickey, is that you don't exactly inspire empathy. I'm all alone on this. I need your help. I want what the prison board is doing to be the focus of our follow up episode. Now I have interviews with chairman of the prison board Dewight McClusky about this issue. And I'm tellin' ya, Mickey, he looks bad. The two psychologists they used for their psychiatric kangaroo court won't talk to us, which always looks bad. I have an interview with both the judge of your trial, Bert Steinsma, and the psychologist and author, Emil Reinghold, both of which discount the notion that you're insane. You put that all together, and what the state is doing becomes obvious. But the network isn't satisfied. They feel the show needs another element. It needs you. In order to put the show on the air, I need to get an interview with you. You haven't talked to the press since your trial. Now, a few days before you get transferred to an asylum, you grant an interview on television with Wayne Gayle. We're talkin' a media event here. Every son of a bitch out the with a TV set's gonna tune in to see that. We'll make their motives so blatant, we'll shame 'em into dropping the whole thing. At least for a little while, the publicity would keep them from just giving you and Mallory lobotomies. Well, whatta ya say?	Have you talked to Mallory about this?
2 She won't even see me, Mickey. Now you're not supposed to know anything about what's going on with her, but I'm gonna tell ya somethin'. Since you two've been sentenced, Mallory hasn't spoken one word.	She doesn't talk?
3 Not to anybody. She sings.	She sings? What does she sing?
4 Songs. 'He's A Rebel', 'Leader Of The Pack', 'Town Without Pity', that Dusty Springfield song 'I Only Want To Be With You'. That's what I hear anyway. Her behaviour was the main thing the doctors' report used against you. So even if she would see me, which she won't, I couldn't put her on camera anyway. If I ask her, 'Mallory, are you insane?' And she starts singing 'Dead Skunk In The Middle Of The Road', that blows our whole case.

1 You guys wanna hear a joke I heard?	Sure.
2 Now, I'm no comedian, but it's pretty funny. It's a Little Johnny joke. Now in the joke, Little Johnny can't talk. And Little Johnny's teenage sister asks her mother if she can go out on a date.

1 ...developed between the three of us. We're kindda in this together, don't ya think?	No. Not really.
2 Don't touch those triggers! Please. I think I've already proven that a live Wayne Gayle is much more better that a dead...Way-- Gayle. I was your passport out of jail, not Duncan Homolka. But me! I'll be your passport outta---	Just save your breath, Wayne. We hate you. If anybody in the fuckin' world deserves to die, it's you.

1 Yes.	Yes.

1 Okay, guys, we're here. L.A. County Jail. Julie, just park in the front.	Wayne---
2 Roger, I'm starting to get pissed. Just drop this fuckin' donut shit, and gather your gear.

1 We got tonight and tomorrow to get our shit together. The day after that they're shippin' Mallory. That's when we do the Mickey Knox interview, 'cause the next day he goes.	Would the network really not run it without the interview?
2 Are you kidding? The last thing they expected was Mickey Knox to get up close and personal. They wanted a follow up episode and would've taken anything I had given them. I'm not gonna tell Mickey Knox that. I'm gonna make him think his grey matter depends on it. When I told Woody and the brass about this coup, they practically shit a brick. I'm talkin' an adobe brick. They want to expand the show to a hour, and they want it on immediately.

1 Hello, Mr. Gayle. I'm Phil Wurlitzer. We talked on the phone. It's a pleasure to meet you.	Same here. Let me introduce my crew. Scott...Roger...and Unruly Julie ...this is...I'm sorry. What's your title again?
2 I'm the superintendent here at L.A. County Jail. Me and my deputies are who you'll be working with while you're here.	That sounds great. Look, I don't want any of this to intimidate you. This is not going to be a big deal. This is going to be very easy.  I need to talk with Mr. Wurlitzer. You guys get your equipment ready, power up the van and confirm a transmission code for the remote. Julie come with me.

1 How 'bout that furniture plant?	Man, the darkest thing they got in there is Coca-Cola.
2 Yeah.	Now, if you want to work like a real nigger, you can always go out and chop cotton.
3 They done that too long in my family.	They pay you three bucks a day an' all the cotton you can eat.

1 Look, boy, we got a smooth operation here, and I aim to keep it that way. Now I got an idea you're plannin' trouble.	No. You got the wrong idea.
2 All right, then. All I want you to do is tell these boys here you didn't mean what you said about stickin' together an' all.

1 Hey, boy - I'm talkin' to you.	Name's Duff.
2 How 'you doing?	Okay.
3 Looks like you're doin' a good job.	Thanks.
4 Don't say much, do you?	Guess I don't.
5 Just so you do your work.

1 Haven't seen you around, have I?	No. I'm new in town.
2 You working?	Yeah. On the section gang.

1 Not here, Duff.	I get it.  Yeah, I can see your old man with a shot-gun right now.
2 But I would like to see you again.	You would, huh? If I was you, baby - I wouldn't go 'round stickin' out my jugular vein.
3 What d'you mean?	You almost got into trouble back there.
4 I wouldn't have let you.	Hell, baby, I'm not in the third grade. Well, look - what' we gonna do next time -- have a nice long chat in the parlor?
5 No, on the porch.	Oh yeah, and then what?
6 What?	Well, either we're gonna hit the hay or get married. Now you don't want to hit the hay, and I don' want to get married.
7 You have some very primitive ideas, don't you?	All right, so I'm primitive. So what d'you want with me?
8 Look, Duff - most of the men I know - they're kind of sad. When I met you the other day I had a feeling that you're different. That's why I went out with you. I thought we might have something to say to each other.	Hell, baby, I don't know what to say.
9 Good night, Duff.

1 That's Bessie Hall. Barney works at the mill.	Yeah?

1 How would you like to have a baby, Duff?	Huh?
2 Don't look so scared.	You jivin' me?
3 Well, I haven't come around.

1 You heard me!	I can't stand to see you like that. I know you can't help it.
2 Stop bein' so damn understandin'.

1 We was just leavin', fellows.	Let's go, Jocko. The man's got homework.

1 I said, I come to town with a girl.	Plannin' on getting married?
2 No.	'Don't sound so sure.
3 Well, matter of fact, I done a lot of bangin' 'round.	Yeah. That's how me an' your mother got started. I'm tellin' you, boy, you ain't got a chance without dough. They take it all away from you.

1 That's the trouble with you boys! Don't listen when a man tells you something.	She don't look no worse to me.
2 Don't do her no good to get banged like that.	Don't do her no good to go into a tree.
3 What did you say, boy?!	I said, she's in great shape.
4 I heard you! Now 'stead of bein' smart, you just get that car out of here!

1 Maybe I could talk to Bud Ellis. He might have a job for you at his filling station.	Oh yeah?
2 I'll be seeing you.

1 Pour your own trouble, Will.	Your mother used to lay for her boss, boy. Did you know that?
2 Shut up, Will.	Okay, so what's a girl supposed to do? Me not workin' and her cleanin' house for a white man. I'm tellin' you, boy, keep away from marriage. Ya gotta stay light on your feet or you won't make it.

1 Omar, your wife's here.  Ny superiors: will allow me to make the trade now.  But I gotta see that you haven't hurt the other hostages.  If you haven't, I'11 take the girl and send in your wife.	Nice and slow. You come in. Get a look around.  Then I get my wife.

1 She's very striking, don't you think? Are these glasses a fashion where she comes from?	She was prettier before she tarted herself up with the hardware.

1 What's an A.I.	An Artificial Intelligence. A computer system that's developed the capacity for sentient thought. They're dangerous and totally unpredictable.

1 If someone is infiltrating the matrix on a global scale no political or economic system is safe. I'm assembling a team of specialists, Mr. Case. We need a man who can enter the matrix and trace this saboteur.	My days of punching deck are over. For you or anybody else.
2 What would you say if I told you we could correct your neural damage?	I'd say you were full of shit.

1 Fried Air Tram in the process. Not to mention half my gear.	What about McCoy?
2 He's got a little attitude problem, being that he's dead and all, but he'll come around. Where's Molly?	Prepping your trip.
3 Really? Do I get to know where I'm going? It makes packing so much easier.	Offworld. The A.I.... this "Wintermute" thing evolved on a computer mainframe on the satellite Freeside. If you attack it from within the matrix while Molly accesses its original programming we can cripple its defence systems.
4 That could work, but the timing will be a bitch.	You'll be linked during the entire operation.
5 Linked?

1 Tell me the words.	The words?
2 The access code to your mainframe.	Ah, yes... the code. It's a riddle, actually. Some fancy of 3Jane's. Unfortunately, you'll have to find out for yourself. I can no more know that code than I can shut down my own hard wired defences. Now, our time is running short... and you haven't even touched your drink.
3 What's inside me, Wintermute. What did your doctors do to me?	Patience, Mr. Case. Only one hour and thirty-eight minutes to enlightenment.

1 Maelcom... Do you think there's a hell for computers?	All things possible in Babylon.
2 Help me send this Wintermute motherfucker straight down into it.

1 I duped these prints off him. Can you run an I.D.?	No problem, amigo.
2 What about the A.I., Dix? Sense/Net hasn't even been able to trace it.	Those guys couldn't even find their own dicks with tweezers and a magnifying glass.  Tell you what, Bro. I'll make you a deal. I help you nail this A.I., you gotta do me one favour.
3 What?	When we're done, erase this friggin' tape.

1 You're late.	How's the ice?
2 One minute eighteen and counting. What about the access code?	It's coming.
3 You haven't got it?	I said, it's coming. Just get me in, man.
4 This thing's loaded with internal virus systems. You'll fry like an egg in there.	Then I'll fry taking this son of a bitch out. I'm making the run, Dixie.
5 I'm getting too old for this shit. One oh four and counting.

1 And we really do have to talk.	You set me up from the beginning. It was you that got Julius killed.
2 I had to limit your options.	And Linda...
3 You know why Linda's dead. She loved you and you let her down. It's that simple. Of course I did instigate certain events. Calculated the variables. I found her to be... expendable.	I'm gonna burn you to the ground, you son of a bitch.
4 Excellent. That's exactly what I had in mind. But if you're going to kill me, we have to work together, old son. I'm no pushover, you know.	Shut down your ice patterns. I'll take you out.
5 I can no more shut down my own natural defences that you can stop breathing. That's why I need you, Case. You're the only person alive who has a chance of penetrating my defences. My "ice" as you call it. I'm doing everything I can to make that possible.	Why would you want me to kill you?
6 Let's just say we have a destiny to fulfil, you and I.	I think you're full of shit.
7 No, It's you that is full of shit. And blood. And bones. A typically imperfect organic being. You've been hopelessly predictable all along, but you're going to have to do better than that now.

1 How soon is soon enough?	Couple of days. They'll examine you.

1 I'll get the car.	They'll cut you down.

1 The code's some riddle of 3Jane's. Once I'm in the matrix, you'll just have to take a shot at it.	...And if I guess wrong?
2 Then you and Maelcom get out of here before the place is crawling with guardsmen.	We've still got to find the mainframe.
3 No we don't...

1 How long will they watch us for?	Until Guy tells them to go. Once they watched me for like two hours. I found my car the next day in the T.J. Maxx parking lot.
2 Why do they listen to Guy?

1 Have you ever wanted to go to The Court?	Are you kidding, Josie? It's lame. All they do is stand around and get drunk. It's lame.
2 It is?	Yes, it's lame.
3 Yeah, it sounds lame. Why would we want to go there, and stand around?	Exactly.

1 I had a lunch break so I thought I'd come by and see you. Your teacher is a fox!  Why don't we discuss that after class. But the burning is totally normal.  Oh look. Class is over already.	I thought this was a 45-minute seminar.
2 Right. Right.

1 You don't think I can do it.	No - It's just a lot of pressure for your first piece, that's all. I mean, it's not a half-page article, it's a major undercover piece, Jos. Look what Rigfort did to Dutton - and that guy's his cousin!

1 George! What are you doing here?	Just get in the van, Josie.

1 : Wait. Do you know any gay guys?	Why?

1 It's an expose on cafeteria food.	And you're leading with the terrible truth about cole slaw?!
2 Well, the bulk of it will be about the pimento loaf--	Geller...you wanna be a reporter? Take a look at what sells! Sex scandals. Bribery. People jumping off buildings. So unless a kid just killed himself because he was being paid to have sex with the school mascot in a big vat of this cole slaw, you got nothing!

1 Yes you are. A guy. Guy. Quite a guy. Oh my. Look at that--I rhymed.  Yikes.  Bikes!	Are you in special ed?

1 God, I can't do this.	Maybe because we're not supposed to be having sex with bananas.
2 You know what, though? I feel like I'm really ready to do it. To have sex for the first time.	Wow. That's big. I mean sex is a really big deal. You shouldn't do it until you know you've found the right person.

1 No, I mean, no big whoop.	I can't do this.

1 Josie, finally. I just wanted to come over and make sure you're okay.	Really?

1 Boys.	I know.
2 I'd like to tell you that we all grow out of it, but that's a lie. Some of us will always be rattling cages.	Why do you do that?
3 I don't know. And you know what's scary--when you get older it just gets more confusing. I've spent the last ten years with women who are basically all wrong for me.  You know what, I shouldn't be talking about this stuff with you.	That's okay. It's nice to have someone to talk to--

1 Please. Please don't walk away.	I just can't look at you the same way.

1 Aloha! Welcome!	Relax, Monty. It's just my sister.

1 He <u>has</u> to know...	Everybody knows about--

1 I do the best I can to make it comfortable for us here.	I know.
2 But I guess my best just isn't good enough.

2 Don't tell me it's not the gas!

1 I'm not afraid of you.  You couldn't kill me...He's in there and I want him back.  I'm gonna take him away from you and you're going straight back to hell, you son-of-a-bitch!	Jesse's dead!  I sliced 'im real good!

1 You remember your dreams, Grady?	Only the wet ones.

1 You okay?	Yeah, yeah, sure.
2 Let me look at your eye...

1 This is amazing!  Your dream told you where this was?	Only it was more like, you know, sleep- walking.  All I know is I woke up on the cellar floor next to it.

1 So, you feeling anything?	What do you mean?
2 I thought you might be able to make a connection.

1 You should eat something - you'll feel better.	I'm not hungry.
2 I wish you'd talk to me.  We can figure it out, you know.  We can figure it out together.	There's nothing to figure out.

1 What's so funny?	We must look like a couple of escapees from a veterans' hospital.

1 Hi, guys.	Hi, Kerry.
2 I got your invitation yesterday. Thanks.  Any cute guys gonna be there?	All of them.
3 Yor dad picking the music again?	Mom's trying to keep him upstairs.

1 Good morning, Jennifer.	Morning, Doctor Goldman.
2 How's your hand?

1 I'm glad things have worked out for you.	I think new York was just what I needed.  So many people.  I never feel alone.
2 The city that never sleeps.  So what will you do now?	I don't know.  I'm busy with school. New friends.  But I'll never forget the old ones.
3 To old friends.  And your new dreams.	To old friends.

1 Joey needs us.  I can feel him.	How do we find him, Kristen?

1 Max, where's Kristen?	She's been waiting outside your office since breakfast.

1 It's over.  It's over.	Nancy...

1 Stop blaming yourself.	I'm running out of answers. A patient sleepwalks out of a security ward up to a tower with no access.  A girl, alone in a room, dies by jumping six feet straight up into a television set. Nothing makes sense anymore.
2 Then maybe you're ready.	For what?
3 The truth.	Try me.
4 Only if you're willing to put aside everything you've learned and trust me. Can you do that?	I can do that.

1 Neil, it's no use.  You saw how he is.	Just go.  Kristen needs you.  Keep her awake somehow.  Do it.

1 Somebody else is out here.	No.  We're alone.

1 I'm sorry, Neil.  You brought this on yourself.	For God's sake, Elizabeth...just try to help the kids, will you?  Listen to them.
2 Of course.

1 Lovely to meet you.	And you.  I'll wait till you've gone before I tell him you're a vegetarian.

1 That book's really not good -- just in case, you know, browsing turned to buying.  You'd be wasting your money.	Really?
2 Yes.  This one though is... very good.

1 Oh hi.  Forget something?	I forgot my bag.
2 Oh right.

1 I'm just a complete moron.  Sorry. This is the sort of thing that happens in dreams -- not in real life.  Good dreams, obviously -- it's a dream to see you.	And what happens next in the dream?

1 It's a disease I've got -- it's a clinical thing.  I'm taking pills and having injections -- it won't last long.	Step aside.

1 I'm really sorry about last time.  He just flew in -- I had no idea -- in fact, I had no idea if he'd ever fly in again.	No, that's fine.  It's not often one has the opportunity to adios the plates of a major Hollywood star.  It was a thrill for me.  How is he?
2 I don't know.  It got to the point where I couldn't remember any of the reasons I loved him.  And you... and love?	Well, there's a question -- without an interesting answer.
3 I have thought about you.	Oh no no -- no.

1 Rita Hayworth used to say -- 'they go to bed with Gilda -- they wake up with me.' Do you feel that?	Who was Gilda?
2 Her most famous part -- men went to bed with the dream -- and they didn't like it when they woke up with the reality -- do you feel that way with me?	You're lovelier this morning than you have ever been.
3 Oh.

1 You're right: of course, you're right. It's just that I've dealt with this garbage for ten years now -- you've had it for ten minutes.  Our perspectives are different.	I mean -- today's newspapers will be lining tomorrow's waste paper bins.
2 Excuse me?	Well, you know -- it's just one day. Today's papers will all have been thrown away tomorrow.
3 You really don't get it.  This story gets filed.  Every time anyone writes anything about me -- they'll dig up these photos.  Newspapers last forever. I'll regret this forever.

1 I hoped there might be -- but no, I'm assured there aren't.	And what would you say...

1 That's right.	And this is William.

1 This painting isn't the original, is it?	Yes, I think that one may be.

1 I was called and I came.  What's up?	William has just turned down Anna Scott.
2 You daft prick!

1 Mr. Thacker?	Yes?
2 Have you got a moment?

1 Max.  This is Anna.	Hello, Anna ahm...  Scott -- have some wine.

1 Oh God no.	So not over her, in fact.

1 Well, yes, that's perfect. Well done.	Thanks.  Great.  Wish me luck.
2 Good luck.

1 Thanks for your help on the glasses thing.	You're welcome.  Did you find them?
2 Sort of.

1 Which floor?	Three.

1 Yes, Mister Harding?	Is it true McMurphy killed two attendants and escaped yesterday?
2 No. Mister Harding, that is not true.

1 Yes, ma'am...	Will you come with me, please.
2 Hold the fort down, will ya, fellas!

1 Sorry to have bothered you.	Not at all, Mister McMurphy...

1 Mister McMurphy, you are deliberately violating the rules!...	He's into his wind-up. Here comes the pitch. Strike on the inside corner!

1 Whatcha boys playin'?	H-H-Hearts.
2 Shoot! No wonder you don't care nothin' 'bout showin' your hand.

1 A bus?	Y-y-yes, a b-b-bus!
2 Well, shoot, man! Whadaya say we take ourselves a little spin around the place.

1 In ya go...	M-M-M-Mack?
2 It's okay, kid. Everything it going to be okay... I'll come back an' getcha in a while... 'Kay...

1 She won't give me any more cigarettes!	That okay. I'll take your marker. How many ya want?
2 Lend me twenty.

1 Yeah, where we going?	I dunno. Where do ya wanna go?

1 Yeah, my feet are cold...	My feet hurt...

1 You boys seem to think you've got a champ in there, huh?	I don't see you scoring any points, buddy. And you're just the man for the job, right?
2 Hell, I couldn't get it up over old hatchet-face if ya paid me!	She's not all that homely, Mister McMurphy. In fact, she must have been a rather beautiful young lady.

1 Time in!  Hold it! Time out!  I said Harding out!	I refuse!
2 I said out!	No!
3 I'm the coach!	I just started!
4 You can come back later!	I don't trust you!
5 Scanlon out!

1 Hit me!	Wait a minute, Martini, I can't hear a thing.  What?

1 I wanna see it...	Me too! Me too!

1 How are you feeling?	Just fine, Doc... In fact, I think I might've put on a couple of pounds since I got here.
2 Good, good, and how are you getting along on the ward?	Come on, Doc, you know as well as I do what's been comin' down in that loony bin.
3 Yes, well, Miss Ratched feels that you're a disturbing influence on the other patients.	Shoot, Doc, the only one I'm disturbing is that old nurse and her fixed ways. That's all.
4 Yes, that may be so, but in making a careful study of your past record, along with your behavior since you arrived here, my feeling is that you are not mentally ill and it is going to be my recommendation that you be returned to Pendleton where they are better equipped to handle your case.

1 Put your money where your mouth is, Taber.	Yeah, yeah, you're a fucking phony, McMurphy!

1 Hey, how's it look up there, big boy?	He can't hear you. He's just a deaf and dumb Indian!
2 That right?

1 I'll be very glad to show you around, Miss...	Yeah, that's a good idea, Turkle. Why don't ya take Rose on a little tour of our facilities...

1 Hi.	Hi.

1 Of course.  Mister McMurphy.	After you, ma'am.
2 Thank you.

1 What are these men doing up wandering around?	Ah guess the natives are restless, ma'am...
2 You've been drinking on the job again, haven't you, Mister Turkle!	Ah, no, ma'am... well, yes, ma'am...  A man get awful lonely at night, if ya know what Ah mean, ma'am...

1 She was your sister.	No, she wasn't my sister.
2 Your mother.	Of course not.
3 Your grandmother?	Look, she wasn't a relative, okay? I don't know who she is.

1 She's trying to find out where she can rent a loudspeaker.	What for?
2 So she can drive through the streets of Rome paging the man of her dreams.

1 What?	My name isn't Damon Bradley.  I just told you it was Damon Bradley.
2 What is it?

1 I'M NOT PUSHING IT.	Wait.  I have to write this down.

1 It's an amazing place, don't you think?	Amazing.
2 Smoking or non-smoking?	Non.  Please.

1 Why can't you just tell me?	If it's any of your business, yes.
2 Yes?!  To be married, I suppose.	Yes.
3 To the foot doctor.	Yes.

1 Uh, I'd rather not say.	Tell me.
2 I'd really rather not say.	Please.  I need to know.
3 Mickey Spillane.	Mickey Spillane?
4 Or Hustler.

1 What?...	What are you doing here?
2 We were hungry.

1 Promise me you won't leave without saying goodbye.	No.  Course not.

1 And this is the thanks I get.  I did you a favor.  You never wanted to marry that joker in the first place.	That's not the point.  And what if I had wanted to?
2 If you had wanted to, you'd have gone home.

1 Sure.	Brunello di Montalcino, '85, please.

1 I don't believe in statistics.	You're an accountant for cryin' out loud.

1 He begged me to marry him.  I didn't even want to marry him.	Yes you did.
2 Well, I wouldn't've if I hadn't thought I was in love.

1 I can't believe we did this.  Do I have to remind you that your wedding is in six days?	Look, I know you think this is irresponsible of me, but think how much more irresponsible it would be to marry the wrong person. 

1 Just once more, so you'll be sure to know what to look for.	Faith, I've seen it already, okay? If I spot somebody who's got a head that's an eighth of an inch around, standing underneath a tuba, I'll recognize him from the photo. Otherwise, I'm telling you, it's not gonna do me any good.

1 You expecting somebody you know?	Well, you don't have to get snippy with me.
2 Sorry.

1 He's heeeeeerrre...	Oh my God.  Where?
2 He's sitting in the fourth booth down, on the left hand side, with his back to us.  He's wearing a navy jacket.  If you turn around, you can see part of his right elbow.	Is he looking at us?
3 Nope.

1 Peter found him?	Yes.  Isn't that amazing?

1 Kate is that you?	Uh huh.
2 I didn't expect you back so soon.

1 No, you don't understand.  It's been wonderful meeting you.  But... I have a husband.  I have two kids at camp.  I have a life I have to go back to.	You don't have to go if you don't want to...
2 But I do want to.

1 I have to talk to her.	She's not here.
2 Where is she?	She went out to check into skywriting.  I can't believe you lied.  Is this a genetic thing, men will say anything just to get laid?
3 No!  That's not fair.  That's not it at all.  Look, something somewhere got screwed up.  Maybe some metaphysical wires got crossed.  I may not have the right name, but I was there.  I'm the guy.  I'm-- skywriting??

1 What gives with our boy tonight, Charley? He ain't himself.	The Joey Doyle thing. You know how he is. Things like that he exaggerates them. Too much Marquis of Queensbury.  It softens 'em up.
2 Listen kid, I'm a soft tough too. Ask any rummy  on the dock if I'm not good for a fin any time they put the arm on me.  But my old lady raised us ten kids on a stinkin' watchman's pension. When I was sixteen I had to beg for work in the hold. I didn't work my way up out of there for nuthin'.

1 The complete works of Timothy J. Nolan.	Nolan? I knew he had guts but

1 What happened?  What happened?	Tommy, what happened?

1 I changed my mind. I feel real mean tonight.	Good. So do I.

1 Like Joey? Are you afraid to mention his name?	Why keep harpin' on it?  Come on, drink up. You got to get a little fun out of life. What's the matter with you?  I'll play you some music.

1 Pigeons... .	There's a hawk around. They're scared tonight.

1 Terry, you're bleeding.	Do what I told you. Take care of Charley.
2 Terry, for God's sake.	Get out of my way.
3 No, I can't let you. I can't, you're

1 I want to see you, Terry.	You got eyes. I'm right in front of you.
2 Now don't give me a hard time.	What do you want from me, Father.
3 Your gun.	Mind your own business, Father.
4 This is my business.	Why don't you go and chase yourself?
5 Give me that gun.	You go to hell.
6 What did you say?	You go to

1 Never will be much too soon.	Take it easy.

1 You're doin' lovely, Terry, very lovely.	O.K., O.K., That's enough.

1 Give me a double.	Take it easy now, Terry.
2 Keep the advice. Give me the whiskey.

1 Shut up. I like the kid.  Remember the night he took Farella at St. Nick's, Charley. We won a bundle. Real tough. A big try.	Not a dent.  Perfect
2 My favorite little cousin.	Thirty-six sev aah I lost the count.
3 OK skip it, Einstein. How come you never got no education like the rest of us?

1 You know what I mean. Leave her alone.	I was only talkin' to her.
2 She's off limits for bums like you. Leave her alone.	I can look at her, can't I? It's a free country.
3 Not that free.

1 Leave her alone, you fiend!	Fiend is it!  You will not be so fortunate.  Your existence will cease within moments.  No one wishes to see a man dance...  And you, my dear, will entertain for centuries to come.
2 If I could get my hands on you...	..Oh, You could do nothing!  I can save you much pain.
3 Leave her alone, I tell you!	I do not joke in my proposal.

1 The ropes are coming loose.	Be careful!
2 I am--It's our only chance.	Nothing is worth your life.
3 My guess is if we don't take the chance pretty soon, we're not going to have much life left anyway.	I'm frightened.  I'm so frightened.
4 Hold on just a little longer, Shirley.	Be careful, oh please be careful.  We'll never get out of here alive, I know it.  I just feel it.
5 You do?	Yes I feel it in my bones.
6 You're talking nonsense.	Oh, no I'm not.  These heathens probably have an open grave for us.
7 They wouldn't dare put us in the same grave-- <b>or would they?</b>	I should hope not.  I hate you!
8 That sudden?	Yes, that sudden.  If it weren't for you we wouldn't be hunting for an old cemetery on a night like this.  It's all your fault.
9 ...And I thought you loved me.

1 Well?	Ahh, she will be yours.
2 When!?	At your discretion...But first, I desire more entertainment.
3 The moon is almost gone!	Ahh, there is yet time.
4 At the first sight of the morning's rays' light...	I know the laws of the night. I state there is still time for yet another.
5 I would have time for my own pleasures!	Your own pleasure comes only after mine, when I desire it. I am the Sole Ruler of the Dark World.  There is no one to challenge my authority here. My word is the law--all powerful. <b>No one</b> is to challenge that authority, <b>no one!</b>.  Is that understood?  It is my command.
6 I understand, Master	Then see that it does not happen again, in the penalty of Everlasting Despair.  Now are there others?
7 There are others.	Well then let us proceed.

1 I don't like snakes.  I remember the one Cleopatra used.  Cute little rascal until it flicked out that red tongue, and those two sharp fangs.  You'd never think such a little thing packed such a big wallop.	Aaaaahhnnnhaaaaaannnhhh?
2 Hurt her?  Hell, it killed her!	Aaaahhhhnnnahhhnnnggnnn.

1 The FBI didn't tell you I was with them?	They didn't <i>tell</i> me anything, they asked questions.
2 But you know what I'm talking about, don't you?  About Glenn, don't you, and the second car?	I know a Glenn.

1 I talk to the guy you work for, Emil. He tole me your number and where you live.  See, I'm looking for an assistant and would like to speak to you.	Oh.  Uh-huh.
2 You did work for Emil, right?	Yeah, I was Emil's box-jumper for almost four years.
3 You were his what, his box?	His assistant.

1 Do we need him?	The green-and-whites saw us.  One of 'em starts thinking, what's that car doing there?  Ties it to the break and turns around...

1 Think this old guy is her boyfriend? It's the only picture she carries.	Am I going to Detroit by myself?

1 "Fight over tuna casserole may have spurred slaying."  Seems this woman's live-in boyfriend, seventy years old, complained about her tuna noodle casserole and she shot him in the face with a twelve-gauge.  Police found noodles in the woman's hair and think the guy dumped the casserole dish on her before she shot him.  They'd been together ten years.	Love is funny.

1 And she saw you?	Yes, she did.
2 So how's that work, a wanted felon socializing with a U.S. Marshal?	You know how I felt about her.
3 Did you give her a jump?  If you did I might begin to understand where your head's at.	It wasn't about getting laid.  I just wanted to know what might've happened if things were different.
4 You find out?	Yeah, I did.

1 We made it, didn't we?	All you gotta do is get in.

1 Take the radio, stay down here in the lobby, watch the elevator.	What?  Daniel, I wanna go upstairs.
2 You can go wait out in the car, you want to.

1 Quite a mess.	Yeah.  And I thought everyone liked Eddie.
2 Who?	Dude in the dress is Eddie Solomon, used to buy scag off a corner till he kicked it and found his happiness with crack and then started dealing himself. Word on the street was he was saving up for an operation.
3 What is it with crack and transsexuals?	Yeah, Eddie was a real character.  Had these girls cooked the rocks he called the Rockettes.
4 Yeah.  I saw one of 'em outside.	Yonelle.  Looks like someone raped her, shot her, then threw her out the window.  Fuckin' animals.

1 Like being back in the yard, huh?	Just like it.  Nobody backing down. You back down, you pussy.  Tell me what you and Buddy doing up here in the cold?
2 Glenn didn't tell you?

1 Jack, you don't use a gun, do you?	Not until recently.
2 Nervous?	A little.
3 This kind of setup, you don't have any idea what the fuck you're doing -- do you?	You're right.  So why take a chance--

1 That part in the movie where they get shot?  Warren Beatty and... I can't think of her name.	Faye Dunaway.
2 Yeah, I liked her in that movie about TV...	<i>Network</i>.  Yeah, she was good.
3 And the guy saying he wasn't gonna take any more shit from anybody...	Peter Finch.
4 Yeah, right.  Anyway, that scene where Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway get shot?  I remember thinking at the time it wouldn't be a bad way to go, if you have to.	Bleeding on a country road.
5 It wasn't pretty after, no, but if you were in that car -- eating a sandwich -- you wouldn't have known what hit you.

1 You like bourbon?	Love it.
2 Well, we got that out of the way.  Tell me, Celeste.  What do you do for a living?	I'm a sales rep.  I came here to call on a customer and they gave me a hard time because I'm a girl.
3 Is that how you think of yourself?	What, as a sales rep?
4 A girl.	I don't have a problem with it.
5 I like your hair.  And that suit.	I had one just like it -- well, it was the same idea, but I had to get rid of it.
6 You did?	It smelled.
7 Having it cleaned didn't help, huh?	No.  What do you do for a living, Gary?
8 How far do we go with this?

1 You know I saw you on the street.	Where?
2 Outside Adele's.

1 Detroit.  Snoopy Miller told me uncut diamonds are as easy to move as cash.	Ever seen an uncut diamond, Studs? They look like plain old rocks.
2 So.  What's your point?	My point is, that's probably what you're gonna end up with.
3 You think he's lying?	Use your head.  The guys got five million lying around his house, you really think he's gonna tell some motormouth he just met in prison about it?

1 You don't wanna be standing there, the hacks start asking questions you don't wanna answer.	Oh, uh, right, thanks...

1 Foley?  That you?	How are you, Richard?
2 Jesus Christ, what the hell are you doing here?  What's going on?  Who's upstairs?	Maurice Miller, couple of his friends.
3 Maurice?  From Lompoc?  Good God.

1 You don't remember me, do you?	It couldn't have been out at Glades, if that's what you're thinking.  I was never out there.
2 No, that's not what I'm thinking.

1 You there?	Oh, I'm here, all right.  I'm very here. Question is, why aren't <u>you</u> here?

1 Foley?  Oh.  No, it was one of the Cubans.  Linares.	Oh...
2 We went out there, full SWAT, two choppers, the whole bit, but Linares started shooting anyway.  We put him down, but somehow Chirino got away.

1 You fit another Chanel suit in here?	Something better.  Open it.

1 He waved to you?	I couldn't swear to it, but I'm pretty sure he did.
2 You wave back?	I didn't have time.
3 I imagine you would've though.

1 Yeah, someone spotted two of 'em in this hobo camp out by the airport, called the number--	I knew it, soon as I saw they were offering a reward.

1 We have a problem here?	Jack Foley, famous bank robber.

1 Now listen, it's hands off Billy.  I mean, you can put your hands on him if you want to, but then my hands will break yours.	He was that good?
2 No, I was.

1 I th-think I'm gonna like it here.	You guys are new?

1 Didn't you say test the limits?	Hey, you wanna test my limits, you better line up a couple dozen women on the GROUND...cause I got NO limits in the air!

1 Get me into a plane!	Come on!

1 Maybe just trying to measure up.	What's between you and her is between you and her.  But here's what's between you and me.  Everybody has a hero, Danny. And you're mine.

1 So beautiful!	Hang on.

1 Listen you guys.  I'm the first plane -- then McCawley, Walker, the rest of you. I'll have the shortest run.  If I don't make it, you don't go.	Colonel...we're all going.  Whether you make it or not.
2 I know.

1 Whatever you're trying to tell me isn't good, is it.  Or it wouldn't be so hard to say.	The only reason it's hard to say is that I keep thinking I don't have the right to say it.  But I've got to because it's true.  I love you.  That must surprise you.
2 It surprises me that I'm not the only one on this balcony who feels that way.

1 Uncharged torpedoes have different balance.	I have arranged a live fire drill -- with your permission.

1 So you join us, Admiral.  Some of us thought your education at an American university would make you too weak to fight the Americans.	If knowledge of opponents and careful calculation of danger is taken as weakness then I have misunderstood what it means to be Japanese.
2 The time has come to strike!  Or to sit and let the Americans cut off our oil and our future.  I know what you whisper to the others, Yamamoto -- that the Americans are strong.  Yet look at their leader.

1 I may be an old fool, but I think we can help you.	I hope so. At least I got to see you and Grandma.  Has it ever worked before?
2 The last one was six hundred years ago. It's about time for another one.

1 You should have left here years ago, like I did.	It's not the place. I don't buy that.  Trapped in the same town forever. The price she would pay for her teenage lust.
2 After you got knocked up, my mother didn't want me to talk to you. She thought it was contagious.	Oh, it's not so bad. I have two wonderful kids, my own business.  Still, knowing what I know now, if I had the chance to do it all over again, I'd sure do things a lot differently.
3 Wouldn't we all.

1 Did you memorize the whole book or only the good parts?	Just what you underlined.
2 You're kidding...? Carol, you have beautiful hair.	Come on. What's with you and Michael?

1 And we're here on the couch...	Don't say that...

1 Not now, Charlie. I've got a headache. Get used to the word. Roll it around your tongue for a years.	Hey, I can take a hint. You look great today.

1 This is a mistake. We better forget it.	You're damn right! Jesus! Peggy! You sure know how to spoil a mood.

1 Not exactly, but with your great voice, it'll be a huge hit. Honest.	Fat chance. You know, Lee Wilkins came to hear me last night. He told me to forget it. You told me to forget it. My parents tell me to forget it.
2 Just take a look at it. 	If you took the trouble to write it, then sure, I'll take a look at it. But I'm beginning to think that maybe there's more to life than music. I wonder if people would still like me if I stopped being Mr. Excitement?

1 I think we should get out of here. It's going to rain.	Do you think anybody in the Fifties ever made love on a bed?
2 What the hell is that?

1 Did you study for the test?	Test?

1 It was Beth's idea.	I wish I had the nerve. And the figure.

1 That was quite an evening. Bourgeois, phony, decadent, stupid.	I shouldn't have put you through that. It must have been agony. Let's do something.

1 If all the kids jumped off a bridge, would you do that too?	I think I'm way ahead of them.

1 Jack, take it easy. She gave blood at school today. Maybe she's just a little lightheaded.	This is not giving blood. This is drunk.

1 What happened to your hair? You have such a pretty face. Why are you always trying to cover it up?	Oh. I forgot.

1 Where have you been?	I went for a drive. Up in the hills.

1 Mom, sit down for a minute. This is so nice, all of us being together again like this.	Can I tell Diane that Peggy Sue got drunk or is that a deep family secret?  Well?

1 What a great kite.	I'm writing a book on kite construction. What did you want to talk about?
2 I want to ask you a question.  Do you think...time travel is possible?	Are you doing some kind of science project?
3 Sort of.	Well... in a Newtonian framework, the possibilities were limited, but with the advent of relativity theory, the idea of absolute time can no longer be reasonably affirmed.

1 Ah. This is a biggie. Forget sneakers. Running shoes, jogging shoes, tennis shoes. Fifty to two hundred dollars a pair.	Come on. You can't be serious.
2 There are major fortunes to be made here. Leisure time and lifestyles.	Are you talking ~about exercise? Like gym?
3 Not for you. Okay, there's lots more.

1 I came to say goodbye.	Goodbye? Where're you going? What about our partnership? I'm making real progress with the microchip.
2 You were meant to  You're one of those fortunate people that good things happen to.	So are you. You've got a vision.
3 Vision? I'm a walking anachronism! I've upset my parents. I miss my kids. I could be trapped here forever! And poor Charlie...I got pregnant on my 18th birthday and we had to get married. Tomorrow's my birthday! I've got to get out of here now.	Did you break up with Charlie?
4 Yeah, yeah. I'm taking a big gamble. I've loved him for a long, long time.	Okay. Why don't we do something visionary. Change your destiny, Peggy Sue. Change your destiny and marry me.
5 No! No! No! Peggy Sue got married! Case closed. I don't want to marry anybody. Goodbye Richard.	Wait! I'll go with you!
6 You can't. You're going to be Valedictorian.

1 I hear you've got Marjorie Hargrove working for you now.	How'd you know that?

1 What's wrong?!	Nothing. I just got spooked by a bunch of furballs.

1 What are you talking about?	I can bring her back. The same way Drew and me brought Zowie back...

1 I've never seen anybody punch Clyde before.	He pissed me off.
2 Sorry about your mom.  I couldn't handle not having my mom around. Just having Gus...

1 You think my Dad'll figure out why he's not getting better?	You think he'd believe it if he did?

1 I know, Mom.	You know everything, don't you?

1 Thanks, Walter.	What's that on your forehead, pal?
2 Whacked with a racquetball.  I appreciate your faith in my abilities.

1 That's the third time. I better call the office.  Would you relax, please?	I am relaxed.

1 It is, and it isn't, Charles. Macrosystem's new software copies all the best-known elements of Kronos' spreadsheet program. If they're allowed to sell it, Kronos will get undersold right out of business. For me, the legal principle, involved is copyright infringement.	Bearing in mind that Bill Wright, the chairman of MacroSystems, is a close, personal friend of mine... which side of this mess would <u>you</u> desire to be on, Andy? And don't allow my very tight, personal relationship with Bill to influence your answer in any way.

1 This is my partner. We keep records of hospital visits. Nothing personal.	Dr. Klenstein.  It's not a pleasant procedure, but if the KS is causing the diarrhea, we ought to know right away.

1 I buy that.	As in, the vegetable?

1 One more thing, Your Honor...	Any settlement agreement <u>must</u> include, and this is critical, a letter of exoneration, making clear my termination had nothing to do with the quality of my work.

1 I'll look over the Q and A.	You're ready, don't worry.

1 Thanks for coming by.	You bet. We'll see you later.

1 By the time I was fired, there were four lesions on my face, much bigger...	Answer the question, please.
2 No. I can't really see it.	Thank you.

1 Apparently, Mr. Wheeler felt they were too... "ethnic" is the word she used. She said he would like it if I wore something smaller, less garish, and... more "American."	What did you say?
2 I said my earrings <u>are</u> American. They're African-American.	Thank you. No more questions.

1 The guy sat in my office! You can't get AIDS that way, right?	Right.
2 It doesn't travel through the air, by breathing, or touching, right?	Not by touching, or shaking hands, or hugging, using the same toilet... Even kissing someone with AIDS is safe. But it there's something in your past you're worried about...
3 Thanks, Doc, but I don't need an AIDS test. Are you crazy? But thanks for the information. Really.

1 Explain to me, if you can, Mr. Wheeler, explain this to me like I'm a ten year-old. This trial is not about a disease, is that what you're saying? <u>Not</u> about your understandable, if unfounded, fear of catching AIDS through casual contact with someone who has it? You're saying, this trial is about Andrew Beckett's character. Am I getting this right?	Yes, character. To the extent that it affects a person's ability to do a great job.

1 Okay, so... help me with this one, Joe... Is it disgusting for someone to put his dick into someone's mouth? Or, is it disgusting for someone to take a dick into <u>their</u> mouth?	Great, Lisa. Thank you.

1 <u>She</u> didn't try to conceal it.	So you are aware of the difference between a lesion and a bruise, is that correct?
2 I <u>know</u> the difference. That doesn't mean I'm always able to recognize the difference.	But didn't you avoid contact with Ms. Torres, after you found out she had AIDS? She says you acted repulsed by her and you avoided her, is that correct?
3 I felt, and still feel, nothing but the deepest sympathy and compassion for people like Maria, who have contracted this terrible disease through no fault of their own.

1 Andrew brought AIDS into our offices, into our men's room. He brought AIDS to our annual goddamn family picnic.	We ought to be suing him.

1 Gonna lose everybody out here....	He died fast. And if we got any choice, that's the way we should all go out.  Don't you cry for Johns. Don't you dare.

1 I didn't want you to leave me there... back at the ship...that's why I didn't say anything....	No, we'd never....Oh, God, honey, you shoulda told me sooner.

1 Where are the sand-cat tracks? Why aren't we still following them?	Saw something I didn't like.

1 Tell me the settlement is right there! RIDDICK, PLEASE!	We can't make it.

1 Christ, you don't know what's out there!	I know what's in here!

1 What?	Tell me it's not a mirage.

1 He used that?	Sir Shiv-a-lot. He likes to cut.
2 So why isn't it all bloody?	I assume he licked it clean.

1 Oh, this is a dangerous game you're playing, Johns.	May've noticed chains don't work on this guy. Only way we're truly safe is if he believes he's goin' free. But if he <u>stops</u> believin' --
2 You mean, if he learns that you're gonna royally fuck him over.	-- we need a fail-safe. Bring the cells over at the last possible minute -- when the wings are ready, when we <u>know</u> we're ready to launch.

1 He'll lead you over the first cliff. You know that, don't you?	We're just burnin' light here.
2 You give him the cells and the ship -- and he will leave you. He will leave you all out there to die.	I don't get it, Johns. What is so goddamn valuable in your life that you're worried about losing? Huh? Is there anything at all? Besides your next hype?  Got no right to be so scared. Neither one of us.

1 1550 millibars, dropping 20 MB per minute, shit, we're hemorrhaging air. <u>Somethin'</u> took a swipe at us.	Just tell me we're still in the shipping lane. Just show me all those stars, all those bright, beautiful, deep-space....

1 Imam. Slow down.	What?
2 Don't stop, just slow down.  Little more space 'tween us and them.	I would rather we all stay--
3 Do what I say. Please.

1 For what? There is no water. You understand that, don't you?	All deserts have water, somewhere. God shall lead us there.

1 What the hell are these?	Maratha crow-bill war-picks from Northern India. Very rare.

1 I'd rather piss glass.	Well, you got the big gauge.
2 Wanna rag your fat mouth?

1 What's her name, anyway?	What do you care?

1 Cornelius, if you have a moment today, I'd like to discuss this expedition of yours in more detail.	Certainly, sir. I'll get my notes and come right over.

1 To the diggings I worked at a year ago. It's a three day ride across the eastern desert, near where you claim you landed from that planet of yours.	You still don't believe me, do you?
2 It's a long detour to Dead Lake. What would we find?

1 Do you have to work tonight?	No.
2 Neither do I.

1 'I am not a missing link.'	Because if he is a missing link, it means the Sacred Scrolls aren't worth their parchment.
2 Well, maybe they're not.	No, thank you'. I won't get into that battle.
3 Oh, Cornelius, show some strength!	Zira, listen to me. We've got a fine future ahead of us. Marriage. Stimulating careers. I'm up for a raise --

1 Which one was wearing the strange clothes?	Him.

1 Objection!	Sustained.

1 It's no use ... there she goes.	Forget it. Abandon ship.

1 Can we take a dip?	Okay.

1 Lucius.	I think you're making a mistake.
2 That's the boy. Keep 'em flying.	What?
3 The flags of discontent. It's the only way anything ever gets changed.  Don't try to follow us.  I'm pretty handy with things like this.

1 You destroyed his memory! His mind! His identity! And, you want to do the same to me!	Bailiff! Stop this outburst! Gag that monstrosity!

1 However, it's within my power to grant You a reprieve.  That is why I summoned you here tonight.  Tell me who and what you really are and where you come from, and no veterinary will touch you.	I told the truth at that 'hearing'of yours.
2 You lied. Where is your tribe?	My tribe, as you call it, lives on another planet in a distant solar system.
3 Then how is it we speak the same language?  Even in your lies, some truth slips through! That mythical community you're supposed to come from -- Fort Wayne'?	What about it?
4 A fort! Unconsciously, you chose a name that was belligerent.  Where were you nurtured?	I take it you don't believe the prosecutor's charge -- that I'm a monster created by Dr. Zira.
5 Certainly not. You're a mutant.	That's exactly what Zira and Cornelius claim. You're talking heresy, doctor.
6 Of course.	All right, suppose I am a mutant? Why does the appearance of one mutant send you into a panic?
7 Because you're not unique. There was the one you call Landon --	Then you admit --
8 I admit that where there's one mutant there's probably another. And another. A nest of them. Where's your nest, Taylor? Where are your women?	Thank you for calling me Taylor.  Dr. Zaius, I know who I am. Who are you? How did this upside down civilization ever get started?
9 You may well call it upside down, since you occupy its lowest level. And deservedly.  The eastern desert has never been explored -- because we've always assumed that no life can exist there.  Save yourself, Taylor. Tell me -- is there another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone?	I don't know.
10 If you are protecting others of your kind, it will cost you your identity.	I'm not protecting anybody! That hearing was a farce. What have I done?
11 You're a menace! A walking pestilence. I do know who you are, Taylor. As I know that others of your kind must live in the Forbidden Zone.  You have just six hours to make a full confession. After that I'll employ surgery to obtain one.  Guards!

1 Speak! Go on. Speak again.	My - name - isn't - Bright Eyes It's Taylor!
2 There! Can you believe it? I looks like he's talking.

1 Taylor! Tell him.	He has a point. On my planet children often play with ape dolls.

1 Let them talk, Mr President. Let them talk.	Sirs: our theories have a bearing on his identity.

1 WHAT THE FUCK YOU DOING!	Stay out of this Elias. This ain't your show.
2 YOU AIN'T A FIRING SQUAD, YOU PIECE OF SHIT!!

1 Hey Taylor, you don't know it but I saved your ass today. I killed a shit-eating dog. 	That reminds me, I gotta take a shit.
2 You gonna wipe your ass dis time?	Yeah if you let me have your shirt.

1 Shit boy you been out in the sun too long. You try that, he'll stick it right back up your ass with a candle on it.	Then what do you suggest big shot?
2 I suggest you watch your own asses cause Barnes gonna be down on ALL OF 'EM.

1 Feel good?	Yeah. No pain in my neck now. Feels good.
2 Feelin' good's good enough.

1 You okay man? Neck botherin' you?	Nah...
2 Here have some of this. Won't feel a thing.

1 What we got here a crusader?	Sounds like it.

1 He done a year in Japan in the hospital, then when he gets out, the first thing he done is re-up. Four years he been in the field...	...and you know how many times he done been shot?  Seven times!  Seven.

1 You wanted to see me sir?	Jackson, looks like you got Elias' squad now.
2 Squad? I didn't know we was still referring to this platoon in terms of squads sir. 	These two holes are yours...
3 Begging your pardon Lieutenant but my holes are far enuff apart you could run a regiment through there and nobody'd see them - I got five live bodies left...	I don't want to hear your problems, Jackson. You'll get new men any day. Time being you make do like everybody else.
4 Hey Lieutenant I didn't ask for this job, I...	I don't want to hear about it Jackson.
5 You don't want to hear about it?	That's right. I don't want to hear about it 'cause to tell you the truth, I don't give a shit okay... I just don't give a shit anymore.
6 Right...	This is one time we could sure use Elias.

1 Betty, this is Margo West. She wants to meet you. Miss Mayfield.	How do you do?

1 A fellow named Brandon has a penthouse here. He's holding open house. I was up there. Too noisy. Bored.	I see.
2 It might be worth a Martini to you.	I don't need it that badly. I don't enjoy crashing other people's parties.
3 It's open-house. No crashing involved. Anybody in the hotel's welcome.	What did you say his name was?
4 Brandon. Clark Brandon. Fellow about my age. Lot of money... that he didn't make. Former American. Now naturalized in Canada. Social standing indeterminate. Manners not quite perfect. Scotch superb.	You don't sound as if you liked him very much.
5 No.. not very well. And I like his friends even less. But..  If you really want a good dry Martini..	As I said before...
6 Sure. But I'd hate like the Dickens to be held to everything I've said before, wouldn't you?

1 You tried to run away.	There wasn't any plane.
2 It's always a mistake to run away. Always.

1 It still doesn't matter if I kiss you?	Nothing matters.
2 No use waiting, then.

1 Well?	You leave it.

1 This is it, Betty.  They'll find us again, fog or no fog.	If it has to be--do you mind if I do it myself?  Oh, I don't mean with the gun. This is no trick.  When I wrote that note you have in your pocket-- that was no trick either.  It's not so hard for me as you think. I'm not crying about it, I've been skating close to it for quite some time.  The water is cold down there--  But so is everything else.  And there's you.
2 Me?	Yes.  You.  You're not really a murderer yet.

1 Care for a stroll outside? Beautiful morning. The air is like wine, the sky is a deep blue.	Deep blue? I'd call it grey-blue.
2 You must come from pretty far South.

1 What are you going to do--toss your job into Puget Sound?  Because I make you think of magnolias?  I thought policeman was something like a soldier.  That his duty came first.  However much he might happen hate it.	I've been a soldier too.  There is a difference.  A policeman, like a judge, has a right to disqualify himself on proper grounds.
2 What proper grounds?  You can't be in love with me.  You hardly know me.  I'm not in love with you.	I know that.
3 But even if you were in love with me.	There's an empty taxi across the street.  If you're so anxious, take it.  He'll know the way to the police headquarters.
4 You do things the hard way, don't you?	Sometimes.
5 Not sometimes.  Always.  Just because it is the hard way.  You're that kind of man, Jeff.	Goodbye, Betty.

1 There's two hundred. I'll meet you in an hour--where we met last night	Why not here?
2 I don't like your perfume in my office. Make it somewhere else if you don't like Charlie's.	Charlie's suits me fine. I don't scare.

1 It goes with this... cold houses and warm drinks...the effete Englishman.	You're not English.

1 Time for a little chat?	If it doesn't take too long.  Drink?
2 Thanks.  I don't mind.

1 Do me a favor, Mitchell. Find yourself a nice secluded park bench.	Did I do something wrong?
2 I wouldn't know. Just do it somewhere else. There is such a thing as good manners.	How would you know, Brandon?
3 Want to walk out... or get thrown out?	You don't throw guests out, Brandon.
4 Don't bet on it. I'm eccentric.

1 The Harbor police have just picked up a dead man out of the water.	Floater?
2 Not a floater.  Only just dead.	You're the waterfront specialist. Find out about it.  I've got a murder to investigate.
3 You have two murders to investigate. This man's head was beaten in. And there's nothing in his pockets.	Drunk-rolling job.  They hit him too hard.
4 I've been on the waterfront detail for twelve years.  This man hadn't been dead an hour.  He wasn't killed last night.  He was killed today. In broad daylight.  That's no drunk- rolling job.	Let me know when you've identified him

1 I need a receipt.  Sign your name across the flap.	Open it and count it.
2 When you sign for it, you count it.  It's your dough.

1 Was that about the right angle?	I think so.
2 Where's the shell?	Should be over there.

1 You knew Mitchell pretty well, didn't you, Mrs. West?	I was in love with him... which shows you the quality of my brains.  Why don't you ask her about the gun?
2 I shall. From your knowledge of Mitchell, would you say he would be likely to commit suicide?	Anybody could commit suicide, if he felt low enough. I've felt it myself.
3 Then why not give Miss Mayfield the benefit of the doubt?	I'd be delighted to... anytime you can show me the doubt. I'll wrap it up in tissue paper and put a Christmas seals on it for her.
4 Thank you very much, Mrs. West.

1 Am I to interpret that as an order to arrest Miss Mayfield?	When I give an order, you'll not need it interpreted.  You have an hour to make your mind up.  Well, are ye satisfied, Mr. Mitchell?

1 What'll we do about it, Margo?	She is much younger than I am. That's something I'm going to have to get used to. Isn't it, Larry? They'll all be much younger than I am. Here.  Tear them up.

1 My husband apologises for not joining us.  It's not too cold for you, Mr. Penfield?	It's fine, thank you.
2 Since you are a friend of my daughter's, I think I'm entitled to call you James, don't you think?	Please do.  I was beginning to wonder who this Mr. Penfield was.
3 And I'd like you to call me Ann.

1 Thank you.	Sit on that log, dear.

1 Attributed?	Of course.
2 Why, is there a new Foreign Secretary?  Who was the old one anyway?	It needn't concern you, Edward. James has got some news.  He needs a poet's advice.

1 What did you think of that Wadja film?	I quite liked it.  I wasn't as enthusiastic as everyone else.
2 I thought it was tremendous.	I think it went on rather too long.
3 I couldn't bear for it to end.	And I didn't like that man.
4 Oh, but he was terrific.	And the shape of it all.  It was sort of...shapeless.
5 Really?  I thought those long flashbacks were extremely good.	You don't like flashbacks because your mother's a historian.
6 Good theory.  But I like my mother. I have no aversions to what she does.	Too bad.  What did your father do?
7 My real father?  Well, he was a flashback.

1 I haven't seen much of you.	No.  It's a bit of a madhouse. For some reason a lot of my mother's friends specialise in monologues.
2 He's all right, the professor.

1 To the Fleet.	To the Fleet.
2 And the Argies.	The Argies.

1 Susan and I are very old friends, James.	Fuck off.
2 And you were obviously getting nowhere with her.  I was waiting for the right moment to tell you that.	My God.  You even cooked up that Norfolk trip.
3 It might have worked.  Really.  I would have been delighted for you if it had.  But she wasn't interested.  Not my fault.	You're a piece of shit
4 I've known Susan for more than fifteen years.  James, we're old allies.

1 I just might give you a ring when we get back to London.  There's one or two things I'd like to... Will you let me have your number before you leave?  Have you ever watched a commercial being made?	No.
2 Well, it's worth seeing.

1 Don't close the door.  Don't turn out the hall light.	I won't.  Goodnight.
2 'Night.

1 How you figure?	News, last night... those guys, the Ex-Presidents... they robbed my bank yesterday.  And I was just there the day before, cashing a check.  See... look.  Assured Trust... same place.

1 Talk.	She'll be fine, Rosie won't do anything.  At least not as long as I meet him at a certain place and time, about... let's see...  ... six hours from now.

1 Wild ride, huh?	Jesus Christ, Bodhi!

1 Three men dead.  One of them a cop. How's that sit in your gut, Utah?	Take your hand off my shoulder right now.

1 You through, Mr. Wizard?  Let me know if you find Jimmy Hoffa under the seat while you're at it.  Hell, it's only 7:30.  The night's still young... you can solve this case and start on another one.	Well, what're your ideas on these guys?
2 Forget about it, kid.  They're ghosts.  Let the goddamn yuppie Mormon affirmative action assholes handle it.  See I'm almost 55... so I must be senile, right?  They better get me out before I start pissing myself in public.  Drooling. It would look bad for the Bureau, right?	So you're gonna coast to retirement, when you could nail these guys and go out with come dignity.
3 You watch your fucking mouth!  Mr. Hoover himself pinned the Seal of Honor right here!

1 Angelo, pay attention.  There's gonna be a test afterward.  Lab is showing traces of toxins.  PCBs. Heavy elements... selenium, titanium and arsenic.	Guy's the Toxic Avenger.

1 Johnny!  Uh, you, uh... should call first, you know?  Hey, where the hell were you all day?  You gotta at least call in or something.  You okay?	Angelo, we gotta talk.

1 What is it?  You all of a sudden got this bug you had to go surfing? This is a line, right?	No, no.  See, all my life I've done things for other people.  In high school I played football because my old man expected me to.  Then my parents always figured I'd go to law school, so I did.  Football scholarship.  Graduated Phi Beta Kappa--
2 This gonna take long?	Wait, so I'm a big hero to my folks, right?  But two years ago they got killed in a car wreck and I just suddenly realized all my goals had been their goals.  And I hadn't been living my own life.  So I wanted something for myself.  Something that maybe didn't make any sense.  You know what I mean?

1 Those are cold.	Warm them up.

1 Strange, Major. There was a firefight. Shooting in all directions.	I can't believe Jim Hopper walked into an ambush.
2 I don't believe he did, Sir. I couldn't find a single track. Just doesn't make sense.	What about the rest of Hopper's men?

1 It was all bullshit. All of it. From the start... you set us up, got us in here to do your dirty work.	That's right, I set you up. You're a veteran at this, Dutch, I had to.
2 Why us?	Because I told you, you're the best. I knew you could do it but I couldn't get you in here without a cover story.
3 What story did you give to Davis?	We've been lookin' for this place for months. The chopper must have gotten close when they got shot down. Hopper was sent in to get my men. He was just doing his job. When he disappeared I had to clean this up, I had to stop there bastards. We were so close, we couldn't quit. We couldn't sleep through this one. I needed you, Dutch, can't you see that?

1 Don't know, only saw one of 'em. Camouflaged. He was there...  ... Those fucking eyes...	What, Sergeant?
2 Those eyes... disappeared. But I know one thing, Major...  ... I drew down and fired right at it. Capped-off two hundred rounds and then the Mini-gun; the full pack. Nothin'... nothin' on this earth could have lived... not at that range.

1 What have you got in mind, General.	We figure we've got less than twenty-four hours to catch up with them. After that, there's not much hope. We want a rescue operation mounted tonight. That doesn't give you much time.

1 We're on the verge of closing a large navy contract.  Double is ridiculous but we can assure you a healthy profit on your shares.  We would give you a promissory note...	You're not getting any navy contracts.

1 Who are you going after next, sir?	Who indeed...

1 No, you look like a hooker.	Actually, I'm a movie star out for a walk.
2 Good.  Can you tell me how to get to Beverly Hills?	Sure.  For five bucks.
3 That's ridiculous.	The price just went up to ten.
4 Why don't you just do it out of the kindness of your heart?	Sit... and spin.
5 Sit-and-spin.  Alright... why not?

1 Get in.  This side.	What?
2 You know how to drive a stick?

1 Try a strawberry.	Why?
2 Because they bring out the flavor of the champagne.	Jesus, you act like you're seducing some Valley girl you picked up in a dance club.
3 Vivian... the meter's running... cooperate.

1 By breaking up a company's assets --	What are assets?
2 Vivian --	C'mon, I might buy a company some day.
3 Assets are anything of value a company owns.  Sometimes the pieces are worth more than the whole.  By selling them off, I make a profit.	Sorta like stealing cars and selling'm for parts, huh?
4 Not... quite.	There, see?  Now the emblem is right in the middle of the knot.
5 Where'd you learn to do this?	I fucked the debate team in high school.  Tsk.  I had a grampa. He liked ties on Sundays.  You mind if I take a swim in your bathtub before I hit it?
6 Don't drown.

1 Know what we're gonna do in a little while then?  We're gonna call Domino's and have'm deliver a bigass pizza.  We're gonna eat it in bed.  We're gonna veg' out and watch television.	Television?
2 Yeah, it's this box, it has pictures, sound.  You don't have to use your brain at all.	I have work to do.
3 Uh-uh.  No work.

1 Edward, these women here, I don't think any of'm like the guys they're with.  They're just into it for the money.	I'm sure that's true for some of them.
2 I thought I was the pro.  These women make me feel like an amateur.	Ready to stomp sod?

1 I've never been on a plane before.	I'm glad you like it.  Now be quiet, I've really got to read these.

1 I got tired of hating my father.	It was good.
2 It felt good.

1 I want to.	Edward, if the three of us sit down together we might as well announce our plans in the Wall Street Journal.
2 I'll see him alone.  Everyone knows you're my muscle.  We'll make it social.  Tell Kross I'll meet him for dinner.  Tonight if you can arrange it.	You shouldn't go alone.  He might claim that you tried to black mail him.
3 Bill, we're businessmen, not the damn mafia.  I'll see you in the office.  By the way, about your car...	Oh, god, what?
4 I'll bring it back.

1 She met him at dinner last night... I like this tie.	So now they're best friends? Edward, this girl appears out of nowhere and now I see her talking to a guy whose company we're trying to buy.  It's too convenient.
2 You're being ridiculous.	Industrial espionage is not ridiculous.  Edward, how do you know she hasn't attached herself to you so she can bring Kross back information?
3 Christ, Bill, she's not a spy, she's a hooker.  I picked her up off Hollywood Boulevard.

1 I just saw somebody pulled out of a dumpster.  I wonder how much she made tonight?	Don't be mad at me.  I'll pay you back.  I promise.
2 I thought you were giving up that drug shit.	I will.  I'm trying.  Meanwhile I got some crack left, you wanna get high?
3 No, let's go to work.  Okay?	Okay.  I'm sorry I said your dream was stupid.

1 You sure you won't come with me?	And leave all this?  Not in a million.

1 What is it, Miss Vivian?	Edward is taking me to some fancy place for dinner.  The Rex.  Ever been there?
2 It's a bit beyond my... range, shall we say.	Yeah, mine too.  Is it like, y'know, normal?
3 I think you'll find it normal enough.	Will I like it?
4 You'll like it fine.	Okay.  Thanks, Barney.  You're the best.

1 Yes?	Do you remember me?
2 No, I'm sorry, I don't.	I was in here yesterday.

1 My Westley will always come for me.	I suggest a deal. You write four copies of a letter. I'll send my four fastest ships. One in each direction. The Dread Pirate Roberts is always close to Florin this time of year. We'll run up the white flag and deliver your message. If Westley wants you, bless you both. If not ... please consider me as an alternative to suicide. Are we agreed?

1 I never said he was my dearest love. And yes, he will save me. That I know.	You admit to me you do not love your fiance?
2 He knows I do not love him.	"Are not capable of love" is what you mean.
3 I have loved more deeply than a killer like yourself could ever dream.

1 Can you move at all?	Move? You're alive. If you want, I can fly.
2 I told you, "I would always come for you." Why didn't you wait for me?	Well ... you were dead.
3 Death cannot stop true love. All it can do is delay it for a while.	I will never doubt again.
4 There will never be a need.

1 But it did. I was there. This old man said, "Man and wife."	Did you say, "I do"?
2 Well, no, we sort of skipped that part.	Then you're not married -- if you didn't say it, you didn't do it  -- wouldn't you agree, Your Highness?

1 No more rhymes now, I mean it.	Anybody want a peanut?

1 No -- not Vizzini -- I need the Man in Black --	-- what? --
2 -- look, he bested you with strength, your greatness. He bested me with steel. He must have outthought Vizzini, and a man who can do that can plan my castle's onslaught any day. Let's go --	-- where?
3 To find the Man in Black, obviously.	But you don't know where he is.
4 Don't bother me with trifles; after twenty years, at last, my father's soul will be at peace.

1 Inigo.	What?
2 I hope we win...

1 Well, maybe I was a little bit concerned. But that's not the same thing.	Because I can stop now if you want.
2 No. You could read a little bit more ... if you want. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           17.

1 Yellin.	Sire.
2 As Chief Enforcer of all Florin, I trust you with this secret: killers from Guilder are infiltrating the Thieves' Forest and plan to murder my bride on our wedding night.	My spy network has heard no such news.

1 She's been like that ever since the Fire Swamp.  It's my father's failing health that's upsetting her.	Of course.

1 Now?	Not yet.

1 Sir. Sir.	Hah?
2 We're really in a terrible rush.	Don't rush me, sonny. You rush a miracle man, you get rotten miracles. You got money?
3 Sixty-five.	Sheesh! I never worked for so little, except once, and that was a very noble cause. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           93.

1 But I promise I will not kill you until you reach the top.	That's very comforting. But I'm afraid you'll just have to wait.
2 I hate waiting. I could give you my word as a Spaniard.	No good. I've known too many Spaniards.

1 You're amazing!	I ought to be after twenty years.

1 I want to duel him left-handed.	You know what a hurry we're in.
2 Well, it's the only way I can be satisfied. If I use my right -- tch -- over too quickly.	Oh, have it your way.

1 You guessed wrong.	You only think I guessed wrong --  -- that's what's so funny! I switched glasses when your back was turned. You fool.

1 Enough.  It's better.  Please, Lambchop, it's better.  Stop. You're hurting it again.	How do you do.  I mean ... Excuse me ... I mean ...
2 You mean ooops, don't you?  Say ooops and get out.	I'll wait in the hall ...
3 Oooooooops!	Ooooooops.

1 This is hardly a time for levity. I've discovered a serious error here in the accounts of your last play.	Where?  What?
2 According to the backer's list you raised $60,000.  But the show you produced only cost fifty-eight thousand.  There's two thousand dollars unaccounted for.	I went to a Turkish bath, who cares? The show was a flop.  What difference does it make?
3 It makes a great deal of difference. That's fraud.  If they found out, you could go to prison.	Why should they find out?  It's only two thousand dollars,  Bloom, do me a favor, move a few decimal points around.  You can do it. You're an accountant.  The word 'count' is part of your title.
4 But that's cheating!	It's not cheating ... It's charity. Bloom, look at me ... look at me! I'm drowning.  Other men sail through life.  Bialystock has struck a reef.  Bloom, I'm going under.  I am being sunk by a society that demands success, when all I can offer is failure.  Bloom, I'm reaching out to you.  Don't send me to jail.  Help!  Help!

1 Good.  Good.  That's nice.  That's very nice.  I think I'm coming out of it now.  Yes.  Yes.  I'm definitely coming out of it.  Thank you for smiling.  It helped a great deal.	Well, you know what they say, "Smile and the world smiles with you."  Heh, heh.  The man should be in a straight jacket.  Feeling better?
2 Much, thank you.  But I am a little lightheaded.  Maybe I should eat something.  Hysterics have a way of severely depleting one's blood sugar, you know.	They certainly do.  They certainly do.  Come, let me take you to lunch.
3 That's very kind of you, Mr. Bialystock, but I ...

1 There it is... in red and white! "Springtime For Hitler," signed, sealed and delivered.  What's the matter with you?	Look, I'm just not wearing this arm band.  I don't care how big the deal is.
2 Okay, take it off, take it off.

1 I never should have listened to you.	Ohhhhhhhhh, how I hate you.
2 Double.  Double.  Double.

1 You think out of all those Hitlers you could find just one...	It was the same thing in Germany. We looked for years before we found the right Hitler.

1 Do it!  Do it!	I can't.  I can't do it.  It's a demon.  It's a gargoyle, it's a monster... but it's still my child.

1 Feeling better?	Good.  Let's fool around.  Now, I'll be the innocent little milk maid and you'll be the naughty stable boy.  Oh, this milk is so heavy.  I'll never reach the house.  Help.  Will someone help me?
2 Wait.  Wait.  We can't play today. I have too many appointments.	We can't play today?
3 Thursday.  Thursday.  We'll play Thursday.  We'll play the Contessa and the chauffeur.	Oh, the best one.
4 Until Thursday, then, Contessa Mio.	Oh, Bialy, please, just a little. Just a little.
5 All right.  All right.

1 Yes.  The actors.  I must destroy the actors.	Stop!  Stop!  This is insanity.

1 Now there's a couple even remarking about your sign, and see how easily you forgot them?	What?
2 You thought no one has stopped here in weeks. Now, try to remember if this girl...

1 I don't know.	Wouldn't have been able to tail you if you did.

1 Yes, Mr. Lowery.	Caroline...? Mary still isn't in?
2 No, Mr. Lowery... but then she's always a bit late on Monday mornings.	Buzz me the minute she comes in.

1 I still feel...	Can see you do. Sorry I couldn't make you feel better. You want to come to my office this afternoon and report a missing person... And the theft, is what you want to do!  Sooner you drop this thing in the lap of the law, that's the sooner you'll stand a chance of your sister bein' picked up. How about that?
2 I don't know.

1 Probably on his way back right now.	Sam, I'm going.
2 You'll never find it.

1 Where'd you go to college?	I didn't. I got a job, too.  I wonder if that hurt her, my not letting her sacrifice for me?  Some people are so willing to suffer for you that they suffer more if you don't let them.
2 She was willing to lick the stamps.

1 It's regular. Okay?	I could stand something regular.

1 You have something most girls never have.	I have?
2 There's no name for it... But it's something that, that puts a person at ease.	Thank you. Again.
3 You're not going to go out again and drive up to that diner, are you?	No.
4 Then will you do me a favor?  Will you have supper here?  I was just about to, myself... nothing more than some sandwiches and a lot of milk, but I'd like it if you'd come up to the house and... I don't set a fancy table but... the kitchen's awful homey.	I'd like to.
5 All right, you get your dresses hanging out and... change those wet shoes, and I'll come for you soon as it's ready...  ...with my trusty umbrella. 

1 Wait a minute!	Now what?

1 Barefaced.	He told you he wasn't coming right back cause he wanted to question Norman Bates' mother, right?

1 My mother is not dead!	I didn't think so.

1 No mother.	You must've seen an illusion, Sam. Now, I know you're not the seeing- illusion type... But no woman was illusion there and I don't believe in ghosts, so there it is!

1 What made you steal? Are you hungry?	No--I don't want to give any money. Everybody wants money--I'm not going to give any money.
2 Who wants your money-- maybe I can help you.	Maybe you want my money, too.

1 I'm detective Jones. Just dropped in to tell you a bit of news.	You found Buckley?

1 You can't double-cross me like that.  You were to help me. You were to operate on him. You were going to put him under my power.	Not so fast, Mrs. Buckley. That was your idea!

1 By the time we return there, all the preparations for the blood transfusion are completed.	Joseph returns from the room where Gisle is. He has evidently succeeded in calming her. He goes and sits in the chair where Nikolas sat. He rests his head in his hand. He sees the open diary and begins reading it.
2 The blood transfusion is now in progress. The only words are curt orders like: 'Now! - Quickly! - That's enough! - Give it to me! - Sit still!' etc.	Joseph is reading the diary, which arouses his interest more and more. It is as if he finds a connection between what he reads and the fearful events that have taken place around him. An extract from the diary is shown.
3 The blood transfusion continues. Marc has positioned himself outside the circle of light from the lamp, so that he can see Nikolas in bright light, while he himself sits in the dark. Nikolas watches Lone's face anxiously and closely during her struggle with death. Life slowly seems to return to her, and her breathing becomes more peaceful. She opens her eyes and looks at the people round her, but she is much too enfeebled to speak, and closes her eyes again. Marc keeps a close watch on Nikolas, who grows paler and paler. His eyes swivel slowly from Nikolas to the patient and back to Nikolas again.	Another fragment of the diary is shown [having to do with vampires].
4 The blood transfusion is completed. While Marc himself is looking after the patient, the nurse leads Nikolas into an adjoining room, where she makes him sit down and prepares his bandage. The doctor stands bending over Lone.

1 But why? She's the best friend I've got.	She isn't anybody's friend, and I don't like you living with her. She's a bad influence.
2 Nonsense. She's one of the nicest girls I know.	What's nice about her? ... a hard-boiled little gold digger.
3 I won't let you say that!	Well, I do say it.
4 She thinks it's funny to talk the way she does, but--	Don't kid yourself -- she means it.
5 Are we going to have the same quarrel over again?	I'm not quarreling, only ...

1 Listen, copper, get a load of this. While you're chinning yourself on a bar rail, I run down this story ... my story. Consider yourself my assistant.	What do you think I am?
2 Whatever you are, you're the only one of it.	It happens that I'm the law.
3 How quaint. But I can go any place you can. 

1 Well, why so mysterious! Come on, spill it.	So you can give me an argument and tell me I'm wrong. Don't be sil, Kid.

1 Where'd you get the stag hound?	He's not a stag hound. His name is Kelly and he's a police dog.
2 What do you mean police dog?	Plain-clothes man.  Come on, slaves, drink and be merry for tomorrow you might be appointed correspondent to Washington ... a fate worse than death.
3 Listen, Flo, cut it out. Hard-Tack is pretty sore.	Ain't that something. The mad monk of Manhattan. Here goes nothing.  Listen to the animal cracker roar like a lion.

1 Now look here. It's not up to us to do our own detective work. I've had enough trouble over this matter. I don't want anything more to do with it.	Not even if it gives you a clean bill of health?
2 Not even then. The police are the proper people to conduct this affair. Now if you've got any suspicions I'll drive you to the nearest police station.	What! And let every rag in town grab a red-hot story? Not so you could notice it! Now, look, I want you to drive me around the corner and wait for me.
3 I told you I didn't want to mix in it.	All right, brother. Then you can go to some nice warm place, and I don't mean California.

1 I'm not asking you anything. I'm telling you what I'm going to do!	And you think I will permit this, my friend?
2 You've got to permit it! Whose fault is it that no one comes here? The museum at Walston Lane does well enough, and why? They've got Jack the Ripper, Burke and Hare, the Mad Butcher, the Demon Barber of Fleet Street and things people pay to see.	And they are welcome to them. To perpetuate such creatures is to celebrate their crimes.
3 Well, what do you think I'm in this for?  Think of it, man, a match -- a cigar stub -- and ten thousand pounds to divide between us!	You're insane.
4 Not at all -- let me show you how easily it can be done. 

1 Yep. Everything settled.	Good. Well, I'll be seeing you.
2 I'm glad they didn't hold you downtown.	They didn't have a leg to stand on. There's no case against me. It's a clumsy thing to have happen, but nothing to worry about.
3 Well, any time I can do anything for you --	Thanks.

1 Why am I doing this?	It's an experiment.

1 Why?	So I can move on.  You too.

1 Just for a second. Please, Rose, what's the harm?	Buddy, you don't realize it but what you're doing isn't nice.
2 Aw, come on, Rose, I want to see what the nipple on it is like.	You don' t need to know that. It's none of your business.
3 Aw, be a good sport, Rose.  You like me, don't you? I like you a lot.

1 Did your Momma really give you castor oil?	Yeah.
2 You're my sweetheart.

1 Yeah, I know.	Oh, Waski, you don't know anything.
2 I do, too!	All right, what do you know?
3 Rose is madly in love with Daddy...

1 Open that door, damn you!	Daddy, what's the matter?
2 She's got somebody in there, Brother! His shoes are on the back porch -- there they were, naked and smiling at me!  Rose, open this door immediately!

1 Daddy says Rose is calm as lettuce. Do you believe that, Doll?	No.

1 Buddy, that was pretty snotty of you, pushing me away like that just when it was interesting.	You shouldn't watch such things, Doll.

1 I can use a drink after the plane ride I had.	Your wife and children are back in New Hampshire in the snow?
2 Yeah, they're in the snow.

1 It isn't the fourth dimension. To you it's the fourth dimension, maybe, to me it's simply the truth.	Well, well, well. So Miss Rosebud has arrived. Un-hmm. And you're all assembled here. Yes, indeed. Un hmmm.

1 Well, she's back.	What time is it?
2 Quarter of twelve.	Is she all right?
3 I don't see any bruises or broken bones.

1 I can't stand that polecat. They ought to hang him.	You don't like him because he's a Yankee. He's a brilliant doctor.
2 He's a polecat, dear.

1 You're not going to get anywhere with that line of questioning. The problem is, what are we going to do?	That's why I'm asking her who the father is. It's the most vital question of all. Who's the father, dear?
2 She already told you, she doesn't know.	But she must know... unless... unless... Rose, was there more than one person?

1 Well, thank God we are rid of her at last. And the best thing of all is that she's happy. The little nut is happy, she found Mr. Right in the nick of time!	Well, yes, she's happy. Of course Dave doesn't have her life force, not at all. There isn't much furniture in his house, just a table and one or two chairs, whereas Rose has furniture coming out of the windows.
2 Honey, he is Mr. Right.	Yes, I think so. He adores her, it's almost pitiful the way he worships her. I just hope she isn't too much for him.

1 That's a pretty stylish skirt, Rose. The only thing I don't understand is how did you ever get it on.	Well, it has buttons.

1 I got an awful bad cold.	That's all you've got to say, you've got a bad cold?
2 Well, I don't know what happened. They were arguin' about baseball, then all of 'em started fightin'. As for that policeman, I didn't bite him, I don't think I bit him.

1 What baby? What baby? What baby are you speaking about?	Mine.
2 Your baby?	Yes, mine. I'm going to have one.
3 Good God almighty. This is a catastrophe, they won't hire her.

1 She didn't marry him, though, later she married another guy and went to Winston-Salem. It didn't last That girl couldn't have no lastin' marriage, she left him and married another dumb sucker and went out west. Little bitch left him, too, and you know what she's married to right now?  A kike. That's right, some kind of kike horse doctor named Schapiro out in Seattle, who's got the nerve to have the same first name I got. Wouldn't you know it, Rose would wind up married to a goddamn kike? She was always out of her friggin' head and I'll tell you why.  Buddy, she was sick in her mind and between her legs, too. She was a nymphomaniac.	Dave, you are as full of shit as a Christmas turkey and you know it. Now if you want to start a fight on this plane and get yourself in jail, go right ahead. But I am telling you, you are full of shit right up to your eyeballs.
2 I don't want to start no fight with you, Buddy. Why do you say I'm full of shit?	Dave Schapiro is no horse doctor and Rose has been a good wife to him for a long time. To call her a nymphomaniac is the most stupid thing I ever heard in my life.
3 You loved her, didn't you. Well, so did I.  You'll have to admit she had four husbands.	Yeah, it took her a while to grow up and find Mr. Right, but she did it. She found him.
4 She used to call me Mr. Right. Remember that, Buddy?	Yeah, I remember it.

1 Oh, good evening, Doctor. Rose is a lot better, I just gave her her supper. She's almost all well now.	Let me be the judge of that, Madam.
2 Yes. Well. She's upstairs.

1 Oh, no, ma'am.	Well, it's rather interesting about Brother, actually. I realized the remarkable thing he had when he was six weeks old. He looked at me and understood me, he knew exactly who I was. I know it sounds crazy but it's true. He's very remarkable, he was born for the ministry and could move millions, but he doesn't know that yet. I have to warn you about him, he can be very dangerous, there is an evil streak in him, a streak of pure sheer meanness. But at heart Brother is saintly and that is why he was born for the ministry even if he doesn't know it.

1 I'm not goin' in there, I don't like the looks of it!	Rose, sit down in that chair and be quiet! We're trying to help you, you silly creature, sit in that chair!
2 Oh-hh, ohh-hh, Lord, he's gonna kill me.

1 You'll never guess what happened!  I have met Mr. Right! I been with him all day and he loves me, I know he does, he loves me and he's going to marry met Be's practi'cly ast me already!	Well... well, that's wonderful, Rose.
2 And who do you suppose he is? That policeman who arrested me, the one I bit! He is Mr. Right!

1 Take her down to the car, and for Christ's sake be careful this time.  Last suspect he took in, butter-fingers dropped her down the stairs.  What a mess.  Why is it we don't appreciate our arms and legs till we've lost the use of them?	Hey, listen... I'll give you something else, Kittle.  Anything. Remember... remember that corpse washed up on Huntington Beach?  It was never identified...
2 Who cares?	Alright, wait... there's a dentist in Brentwood peddling morphine...
3 Careful she doesn't hit her head on the way.

1 Hey now... what the fuck... ?	Again.

1 Sons of bitches!	We catch 'em, I wanna be first to hurt 'em.  Promise me I get to go first.
2 We'll share.

1 Where you gonna be?	It's personal.  We'll hook up at Billy-Boy's pad in an hour.  See ya then.

1 They... they shot me.	They shot us all, kid.
2 What day is it?	Same day as before.  I think.

1 That's him alright.	It's go time, Billy-B.

1 Bad news is, word's spreading like wildfire that we don't have badges, and nobody wants to end up getting splattered like Butch Cassidy either.	If we don't catch a break soon, we're gonna be left standing with our dicks in our hands.
2 Speak for yourself.

1 I'm gonna put a great big, ear-to-fucking-ear smile on your face.  How 'bout that?	Where have you been?
2 I'm here.  That's all that counts. Watch... you'll enjoy this... it's like magic...

1 You fuckers... damn you!  Why?!  Why me!?  Why the obsession with me?	It's our job.
2 You think you accomplished something... like you're heroes? Fuck you!   This is meaningless! You'll never win!  You know, as soon as I'm gone... someone's going to take my place.

1 If they crash, maybe he'll run.  You can shoot him in the leg or something.	Let's hope.

1 Let's get this thing done.	All for one...

1 You suck at lying, Archie.	See... now that we know you know, the hard part's done for us.
2 It's just a question of how long do we have to slap you silly till you spill the beans.

1 You always did have style.	It's one of a kind.
2 So are you, Pop-Sweet.  That's why...

1 There's still good in him.	I also thought he could be turned back to the good side. It couldn't be done. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil.
2 I can't do it, Ben.	You cannot escape your destiny.
3 I tried to stop him once. I couldn't do it.	Vader humbled you when first you met him, Luke... but that experience was part of your training. It taught you, among other things, the value of patience. Had you not been so impatient to defeat Vader then, you could have finished your training here with Yoda. You would have been prepared.
4 But I had to help my friends.

1 Han!	Luke!
2 Are you all right?	Fine. Together again, huh?
3 Wouldn't miss it.	How are we doing?
4 The same as always.	That bad, huh? Where's Leia?

1 Take the squad ahead.  We'll meet at the shield generator at 0300.	Come on, Artoo.  We'll need your scanners.

1 I...	Ahhh...

1 Guess I owe you some thanks, too, Lando.	Figured if I left you frozen like that you'd just give me bad luck the rest of my life, so I might as well get you unfrozen sooner or later.

1 We're coming!	Come on! Come on!
2 Oh, Artoo, hurry!

1 There it is!	All right, Wedge. Go for the power regulator on the north tower.
2 Copy, Gold Leader. I'm already on my way out.

1 Yes. It's you Leia.	I know. Somehow...I've always known.
2 Then you know why I have to face him.	No! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel your presence, then leave this place. I wish I could go with you.
3 No, you don't. You've always been strong.	But, why must you confront him?
4 Because...there is good in him. I've felt it. He won't turn me over to the Emperor. I can save him. I can turn him back to the good side. I have to try.

1 Told you, did he?	Yes.

1 I was telling the truth.	I know what you told me, Brad. But this Dr Everett Scott.  His name is not unknown to me.
2 He was a Science Teacher at Denton High.	And now he works for your Government, doesn't he, Brad?  He's attached to the Bureau of Investigation of that which you call U.F.O's.  Isn't he, Brad?
3 He might be.  I don't know.	Hmmmm.  He'll be in the Zen Room.

1 I think we took the wrong fork a few miles back.	Oh dear!  But then where did the motorcyclists come from?
2 Hmmm ... Well, I guess we will have to turn back.

1 Oh Brad.	It's alright Janet, we'll play along for now and pull out the aces when the time is right.

1 Great Heavens, that's a laser.	Yes, Dr Scott.  A laser capable of emitting a beam of pure anti-matter.

1 Feeling	Like I'm outside in the rain
2 Wheeling	Free to try and find a game
3 Dealing	Cards for sorrow, Cards for pain.

1 Our noble mission is almost completed my most beautiful sister, soon we will return to the moon-drenched shores of our "androgenous" planet.	Ah - sweet Transexual - land of night - to sing and dance once more to your dark refrains.  To take that step to the right...
2 But it's the pelvic thrust that really drives you insane.	And our World will do the Time Warp again.

1 What's funny?	My mother told me just the opposite. She said, 'You weren't born with much of a body so you'd better develop your brain.'

1 Don't you open them anymore?	They either say, 'Kill the nigger' or 'Hope you die, Honky.' -- What ya got in the bag?

1 ...Paulie, why didn't you tell me you were bringing him home?! Look at me, I'm not ready for this.	Like it would make a difference if you were, right? This guy's a friend and now he's takin' ya out.
2 No... I can't!	Ya, ya goin' outta the bedroom an' I don't wanna know from nothin'.
3 Paulie, please --	Hey, I want ya out instamaticly. -- I'm sicka lookin' at ya hangin' around like a friggin' spider -- Go out -- Live! Do, enjoy life.
4 ...Like you?	Don't get wise with me. I want ya to stop bein' a loser.
5 I can't go out.	Why?
6 Paulie, it's Thanksgiving. I've gotta turkey in the oven.

1 Too old, dull fighter.  Bobby Judge is a good boy.	...I don't feel heat from the name.

1 Now here's what's goin' down. Listen, 'cause I'm gonna say this but one time. On January first, the first day of the Bicentennial I'm gonna fight me a local poor underdog, dig? A snow-white underdog. An' I'm gonna put his face on this poster with me, hear? An' I'll tell you why, 'cause I'm sentimental -- An' all the people in the country all sentimental, man, an' they'd like nothin' better than me, Apollo Creed, to let some unknown get a shot at the greatest title in the world on this country's biggest birthday. Now that's the way I see it an' that's the way I want it!!	...It's very American.
2 No, man, it's very smart.

1 Yo, Rocks, buy us sum wine, man.	...No wine -- Bad for ya' brain.
2 C'mon, man, it's cold, man.	No wine.
3 Yo, Rock, gimme a dollar.	Why?
4 'Cause we dig ya, man -- Gimme a dollar.	No dollar.
5 Hey, give Rocky a dime.

1 We would like to welcome our viewing audience to the Grand World Championship Bicentennial Heavyweight Fight -- the first major event of the Bicentennial Year... A point of interest is that the fight is being beamed to more than seven hundred and fifty million fans in theatres in nearly every corner of the world. I would like to welcome an old friend, and co-commentator for this evening's event -- Jimmy Michaels.	Thank you, Bob. The electricity is everywhere tonight. Rocky Balboa, a fifty-to-one underdog, is living a Cinderella story which has captured peoples' imaginations all over the world -- to quote a popular sports magazine, 'The fighting style should be 'The Caveman Against the Cavalier.' From the increase in sound it appears the challenger is now approaching the ring... His record is forty-four wins, twenty losses and thirty-eight knockouts.
2 I only wonder if this man has the skill to go past three rounds -- Vegas odds say, 'no.'

1 What's ya name again?	Bob.
2 Look, Bob, if ya wanna dance, ya gotta pay the band -- If ya borrow, ya gotta pay the man... Me, I ain't emotionally involved.

1 Here's five hundred -- Put it in your glove.	Do I have to pay juice?

1 Listen, I hope ya don't --	I won't.
2 What was I gonna say?	Ya hope I don't keep acting like a whore or I'll turn into one, right?
3 Ya, somethin' like that.

1 Listen, Rock, you're a very lucky guy.	Yeah.
2 What's happened is freak luck.	Freak luck for sure.
3 Look at all them other fighters. Real good boys. Good records. Colorful. Fight their hearts out for peanuts -- But who cared? Nobody. They got it shoved in their back door. Nobody ever give them a shot at the title...	Freak luck is a strange thing.

1 Don't let 'im get you tight.	Whatta ya think that outfit cost?

1 Hey, Rock -- What happened?	'Bout what?

1 Inflamed joints -- Walkin' in an' out of a freezer carryin' meat plays hell on the joints.	Maybe ya should see a doctor.
2 I don't need a doctor, I need a different job.	Maybe another job is the best thing.
3 Do me a favor -- Talk to Gazzo. Tell him I'm a friend an' would do a good job... Tell him I ain't bothered by nothin' an' would be a great collector... Bustin' bones don't bother me -- Tell him I'm a good worker.	Gazzo's gotta come to you.
4 I'm askin' ya to go to him -- As a favor.	Gazzo's gotta come to you -- Hey, Paulie, it's a bad job -- Do what you do now.

1 Yo, Rock. I made a few phone calls an' thanks to me ya goin' to be a big man -- Thatta dog?	Whatta these guys want?
2 To see ya train.	Yo, what's with you? -- It was suppose to be private.
3 I thought I was doin' ya a favor -- C'mon inside -- Y'know, my sister really likes ya.

1 No.  But neither does Roger.  That's Diablo Red.  Roger's pants are Sunrise Orange.	Well, I'll be...
2 So what's your next move, Valiant?

1 Hey, Eddie, looks like you really stepped in it this time.	What are you complaining about?  Here's your fifty bucks.

1 So what's the scam, Eddie?	Maybe Baby Herman was right.  Somebody wants Acme's property.  Cack the old man, pin it on Roger, and destroy the will.

1 They must've taken it off me.	They?
2 The other people who were in here lookin' for the will.  I woulda caught 'em if Cheetah here hadn't interrupted me.

1 Holy shit, he's a Toon!	Surprised?
2 Not really.  Only a Toon could think of something as goofy as that freeway idea.

1 Lady, I guess I had you pegged wrong.	Don't worry, you're not the first.  We better get out of here.

1 What's with the dip?	That's how he gets rid of the troublemakers.  It's a combination of acetone, turpentine and paint remover. He calls it the...  Final Solution.

1 Hi, Mr. Maroon.  Remember me?	Valiant?  What're you doin' here?
2 I Just thought I'd drop by and show you a photograph.	I've already seen your photographs.
3 Yeah, but I enlarged this one.  Thought you might be interested.

1 Eddie Valiant... you're under arrest! Just kidding...	You idiot.  I lost the key for those cuffs.

1 Here you go, kid... say hi to Casper for me.	But, Eddie, you know what happens when...
2 Drink it, jerk.  All of it.

1 If I don't make it back here by ten...	Yeah?
2 ... I'd head for Cucamonga.

1 Quarrel sir! no, sir.	If you do, sir, I am for you.  I serve as good a man as you.
2 No better?	Uh? Uh?

1 This wind, you talk of, blows us from ourselves; Supper is done, and we shall come too late.	I fear, too early: for my mind misgives Some consequence yet hanging in the stars Shall bitterly begin his fearful date With this night's revels and expire the term Of a despised life closed within my breast By some vile forfeit of untimely death. But He, that hath the steerage of my course, Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen.

1 As the custom is, in all her best array, bear her to church.	And all this day an unaccustomed spirit lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts. I dreampt my lady came and found me dead and breathed such life with kisses in my lips that I revived and was an emperor. Ah me, how sweet is love itself possessed when but love's shadow's are so rich in joy. News from Verona. How now, Balthasar?! Dost thou not bring me letters from the Priest? How doth my lady? Is my Father well? How doth my lady Juliet? For nothing can be ill if she be well.

1 O honey nurse, what news? Nurse?	I am a-weary, give me leave awhile: Fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I!
2 I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news: I pray thee, speak.	What haste? can you not stay awhile? Do you not see that I am out of breath?
3 How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath To say to me that thou art out of breath? Is the news good, or bad? answer to that;	Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels all men's; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body,
4 But all this did I know before. What says he of our marriage? what of that?	Lord, how my head aches! what a head have I! O, my back! Other' other side,--O, my back.
5 I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well. Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?	Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I warrant, a virtuous,--Where is your mother?
6 Where is my mother! How oddly thou repliest! Your love says, like an honest gentleman, Where is your mother?'	O lady dear! Are you so hot? Henceforward do your messages yourself.
7 Here's such a coil! Come, what says Romeo?	Have you got leave to go to confession to-day?
8 I have.	Then hie you hence to Father Laurence' cell; There stays a husband to make you a wife

1 Go! We follow thee. Juliet, Blah!	Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.

1 If ye should lead her into a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross kind of behavior, as they say: for the lady is young; and, therefore, if you should deal double with her, truly it were an ill thing, and very weak dealing.	Bid her to come to confession this afternoon; And there she shall at Father Laurence' cell Be shrived and married.

1 Of course.	Finding this package is a thing easier said than done.  We don't even know what it is.  What did we steal?
2 I don't know.	When this whole thing started you made it clear: you're running the show.  And I don't believe you'd be running this show if you didn't know what was going on.
3 Well I don't!	And I don't believe you...

1 This...this is incredible. Is the rest of Europe like this?	Some places, not all.  Italy, for instance, they're serious about their food.  But try bloody Britain, anywhere in the U.K., you don't get much fancier than a deep-fried bar egg.  Food's not our thing, you see.
2 What is?	Best beer in the world known to man or God.
3 Best beer in the world?  Budweiser for me, thanks.	Budweiser?  You talk to me of beer and you've the unbridled gall to mention Budweiser in the same sentence?  That's not beer!  Christ, it's not even a poor excuse for rabbit piss.
4 Oh yeah?  Whatta you drink, then?	I drink what every civilized man, woman and child in the world drinks: Guinness.

1 Hazard pay...	The two of you were supposed to go to a simple meet and come back with a simple piece of information, and instead you went to fucking war...
2 We weren't real thrilled about it either...

1 Not me.  You work too often with the same people and you become friends -- clouds your judgement.	Come off it, Sam -- if we weren't friends already we wouldn't be here now, would we?

1 Do you have it?	Not so fast.  Who's that?
2 He's company.	Bad company...
3 What do you mean?	He's a cop, Vincent, he's French and he's a cop and you better shoot him in the fucking head right now!

1 So, you've got it all figured, do you?	Figured enough to know there's an odd man out and I'm looking at him.
2 I think not.  I have, of course, taken the precaution of wiring the briefcase to explode five seconds after it opens.  Unless, of course, I deactivate it before it goes off.

1 He's tough, your American friend.	Yes, Sam's tough alright.
2 And you respect him.	Of course.  Don't you?
3 I've never seen a man who could have taken what he just went through.  He's a cop?	Not exactly.
4 Not exactly?  But close enough, eh?  So he saved your life, then?	How did you know?
5 If he hadn't you'd have put a bullet in his head a long time ago.

1 You shoot alright.	Gets the job done.
2 All in the stomach, though.  Your man might live.	Not for long.
3 Long enough to shoot back.	Is that right?
4 It's been known to happen.	Why don't you go do better, then...

1 Sorry I'm late...	What makes you think we're here to meet you?
2 Who else would you be?

1 Help yourself.  Since when do you smoke?	I have, I don't know, maybe a cigarette a week.
2 A cigarette?  As in one?  One cigarette a week, who smokes like that?	I do.
3 Christ, I smoke a pack-and-a-half a day, and I tell myself I could be worse.  It's just so damned pleasurable.	It has it's moments.  Course, you get cancer and die, that's the down side.
4 There is that.

1 I came up here to sneak a smoke.	You were smoking?
2 I hope you don't mind I took your pack. It was on the table.	Please, help yourself.  Smoke as many you'd like.

1 What's this?	The address of the Russian production company.  Just in case we need to find them.
2 Thorough man.

1 Not here.  They might see it.	If I'm going to die for the CIA, I'm going to go out smoking.  Besides, there's half a forest between us and them, they can't see a goddamned thing.

1 Last I heard there was a film rep for the Irish players staying at this address, name of Seamus Reilly.	Seamus Reilly.

1 Tony and I have to talk some business, first.	I gotta try and overcharge him, he has to moan about the price, we settle somewhere in the middle.
2 It's a matter of respect.  Why don't you wait outside, this won't take long.

1 Thanks for the loan, man.  I'll have it in a few days, I promise.	Well I hope so.  That pretty much cleaned me out.
2 I would have asked my sister, but its better to leave family out, always leads to trouble.	I hear you.

1 All right hold on!  Lemme think...  Shit, did you touch the car?	Maybe.  Who cares?

1 I don't know...	You're thinking about killing him.  I can't do that.  No way.  I've never killed a man.  Never even shot at one...
2 Well neither have I, but it's us or him.  If he talks, or writes a note, or whatever, he's gonna turn us in.  Besides, he's a low life scumbag.  His kind is hardly even human anyway.	I...I can't do that.
3 Okay then.  I'll do it.	That's not what I mean.
4 Listen. Do you want to go to jail? Taking evidence, tampering with a crime scene.  You know what they'd do.

1 That's not what I mean.	Listen.  Do you want to go to jail? Taking evidence, tampering with a crime scene.  You know what they'd do.
2 He would have done it to us, right?	Exactly.  This is our little secret, partner.

1 How long is it going to take?!	I don't know!  Shit, give me a break!

1 Dwayne's dead.	I know, I know.  Dwayne's dead, but we can deal with it.  We'll pin it on him.  The DEA was driving Jesse's car. No car phone.  No radio.  They couldn't have called me in.

1 Ok...I'll wait.  For now. But I'm going to need a little advance, to oil the wheels, so to speak.	How much?
2 I understand your logic, Booth, but I don't think...two thousand's going to raise any eyebrows, do you?	Two thousand...
3 By Friday.

1 Normally we would have tracked him with a wiretap, but it was standard for him to occasionally drop out when working with these guys. The last we heard from him was two days ago.	You mean that guy was an agent?
2 Yes.  Wife and a kid.  Don't blame yourself, Deputy.  You did all you could.  You have our deepest gratitude...and my personal thanks.

1 What's wrong?	Nothing.
2 Nothing's wrong.	Oh.  You coming by tonight?
3 OK.	Are you sure you're OK?
4 Yeah I'm fine.	I'm just tired is all.  I'll see you tonight OK baby?
5 OK.  I love you.	I love you too.

1 A satellite dish?	Well I was just throwing out ideas...

1 Business is business.  Now where the hell is it?  I wanna get out of here.  That's the plan, we're just flunkies, you know what I'm saying?	You didn't answer my question. Are you saying my word is of no value to you?
2 You said that, I didn't.

1 He kept a recording of all such transactions in order to keep track of who's who, what was said, what's happening.  I contacted your local coroner, and he found it taped to his back.	That's news to me.  So it's over at Jesse's office?
2 Yeah.  I told him I'd be there before five.	Excellent. I'll go down with you.

1 Mr. Curtis called us this afternoon. The bills arrived at this branch from a cash drop.  Came through a store called After Midnight.  There's only four employees, none of them can tell us who passed them.	Is this marked money, or what?

1 Just goes to show you.	I mean at least pick a more discreet place, the scalp, under the armpit, under the tongue, someplace where the trained eye wont immediately look.

1 What's this?	I don't know...

1 You'd do this to me?!	Dwayne -
2 You'd do this to me!

1 I don't suppose you'll tell us where the tape is.	Well it's not here -- you're wasting your time and you're pissing me off!

1 Don't you want it?	Ah, hell I'll get one soon enough.  Besides, I want you to have it.
2 Well I don't know --	You've done without it long enough, ma.

1 Winner six!	How much is that?
2 Two-hundred thousand!	Two-hundred thousand dollars?  Who wants a hundred dollars?

1 Yeah, that's right.	We need to get out of sight.  Come down to my suite.
2 Look, I've been working this case for months now...	So what's your story?
3 They think I'm a crooked customs agent.

1 You get massage from Chinese girl before?	No.  It's my first time.
2 You pick any girl for you and your friend.

1 Carter, get off that stage!	Are you kidding, they love me.  I'm a star, Lee.  A god to these people!

1 What's wrong?	Over there -- that's Ricky Tan.
2 That's Ricky Tan?  He's four feet tall. I'll go over with you right now, shake him down.	This is a very dangerous man.
3 I'm a dangerous man.  You're not gonna ruin my massage because of some midget in a house coat.	I'm calling for back up!

1 It sounds impossible --	You said --
2 -- but if somebody gave me the chance to square up my father's death, I'd go to hell to do it.

1 Wait a sec - what the hell is that between her legs?	What?
2 She's reaching into her panties -- something is strapped to her leg.  Oh, God...please don't let it be a dick.	What is it?
3 No, I don't believe this shit -- it's a microphone.  Lee, she's wired...

1 As long as you're asking...I think you have a pretty good voice.	I knew it.  What does she know.  You want me to sing something?
2 That depends.  How do the Fu-Cang-Long usually kill their victims?	They'll probably torture us first, shock our privates, then put two bullets in our eyes and one in the back of the head.
3 Go ahead.  Sing your ass off.

1 Lee, what the hell are you doing?	Dancing?
2 Dancing?  I'm out here trying to strong arm Steven Reign, putting my life on the line, and you're up here dancing with some bimbo.  Did she have a friend?	It was Isabella.  She says the plates are in the soft count room.

1 That your gate down there?	Yes.
2 I'm this way.  I guess this is goodbye.	I guess so.  Thank you, Carter.
3 You take care of yourself, Lee.

1 Put your arms around me.	Excuse me?

1 Do you still have the bills?	I still have my lunch money from third grade.

1 If you reach for that gun, I'm going to kill you.	Don't you remember?  I'm already dead.

1 What is your name?	That's cool.  We're gettin' to know each other. This is a good thing. I'm Carter.
2 Carter.  I just want to be able to tell the Ambassador who was responsible for the death of his daughter because he talked too much.	Hey, that's whacked!  I thought we was gettin' on here!
3 Shut up!	OK. Say what it is.
4 The Ambassador will receive instructions for the drop, half an hour before it is to be made.  If it is successful, there will be more. Thank you, Agent Carter.

1 Help me Rhonda.	Let me give you a piece of advice: never touch another man's radio. You do it again, nobody, not Rhonda, not Yolanda, gonna save your ass.

1 When a man steps in dung, it is obvious.  There is no need to rub it in his face.  The smell is the same.	What is that, some kind of Chinese proverb?
2 No. I just made it up.

1 Now, that's American music.	Yes, I know this song.
2 You know War?	Who does not know War?  War, hhh, Wo-ooh-wo-ooh-wo-oh.  What is it good for?  Absolutely nothing. Good-God, you all.

1 No, please, I don't --	It ain't your ass, it's my ass you're backin' up.  Take the damn gun.

1 Not anymore.	Where'd you get it?

1 Oh my god...what happened to you?	It's called a dress.
2 It's called you're gonna kill me. What're you doin' with that on?

1 You understand what I'm sayin'?	Carter, shut up!

1 You got a boy friend in here yet? Cause you're gonna need somebody to kiss your ass goodbye.	What are you talking about?
2 You're movin' to death row. See, your fingerprints are now on the murder weapon of Four FBI Agents. And when I turn this into the lab, they're gonna find Lafontaine all over it. And we already know...  ...this is your MO.	How did I do this?! Maybe you didn't notice but I'm in jail!
3 All I gotta do is implicate.  The Feds can do a lot with a good implication. Even if you don't get Sparky, I'll bet you get ten to twenty more. Plenty of time to find a nice fella.

1 I am not an American, Mr. Russ.  My daughter is not an American.	I understand, sir. But you are an honored guest of the United States...
2 He is already on the plane.  I hope you will treat him with the same respect you have shown me.

1 Ahh.	I'm the town's unofficial fitness trainer.  Big advocate of the mind and body combining for success.  You could say or you can quote me, I'm a glass half full king of guy.

1 I'm really sorry that I hurt you, Brian.	I'm happy here, where I'm supposed to be.  But if you ever become a Catholic, may I ask you a favor, Maggie?
2 Of course.	Could your confess to Father Patrick from now on?
3 Of course.

1 -- It's for you, Ike.	What?
2 Journalism lesson number one.  If you fabricate your facts, you get fired.

1 Ellie asked me to come down to offer moral support.	Since when does Ellie need moral supp--

1 Of course we are.  Of course.	Then you'll be my best man.
2 Well, I'm good, I don't know if I'm best.	Go talk to the pastor and he'll tell you what to do.  And someone will tell me what to do.

1 Hello.  I'm looking for Maggie Carpenter.  There was a sign at the hardware store across the street...	Are you a reporter?

1 They made me put my hat back on.	Oh, yeah.  Scared the hell out of Skipper.

1 That's fair.	Despite what you think, I don't do it on purpose.  And I have no intention of doing it again.

1 My point is that one again, you're getting it all wrong.  That won't improve your reputation any, and it's not very flattering to me either.  So, I'm going to give you a chance to write the truth.	Really.

1 Even with everything that's happened I've still never been married and I still deserve a beautiful dress.	Agreed.

1 No.  But I think attraction is too often mistaken for rightness. Attraction is very misleading.  And if it's mutual, it's well, terribly distracting.	Yes it is.  And it doesn't mean anything.

1 To who?  Are you asking me?	Me?

1 You're a goddess!	I didn't even need to change this gasket, just put in a little hydraulic fluid.
2 Stop it.  When you talk like that, I get turned on and it frightens me.

1 Lighten up, wahine.	Lighten up, what?
2 This party is for you and Bob.  Get your mind off the reporter.	I haven't seen him in twenty-four hours. It just gives me the creeps a little bit. I'd feel better if I knew where he was.
3 Would it?

1 What?	Just stop it.  Don't say another word like that.
2 Maggie, it's just a joke...	No.  It's my life.
3 A harmless joke.	No, it's humiliating and you've been doing it since I was a kid.  I don't like it.  Stop.  You may not like having a daughter with problems.  But guess what?  I don't like having a father who's drunk all the time.  I'll eat in my room.

1 If he eats one tiny piece of a nut --	My head swells up like a watermelon and I drop dead.

1 Couldn't you just do a phone interview?	Not for the kind of place I want to do.  I won't be in Chicago that long.
2 When you get back, I'll be gone --	And then I'll see you in New York --
3 Okay, okay.

1 It's not true, but it feels true.	There's practically a whole book about how that statistic is not true --

1 Did you talk to him?	I couldn't do it.  How did I get here?

1 Honey, he wasn't right for you.	I know.
2 He wasn't even wrong for you, like <u>cosmically</u> wrong, so don't beat up on yourself for wasting...however long it was.	I know. 

1 It's probably just the flowers --	We'll move them --

1 Which means --	The cabinets have to be redone --

1 What are you going to do, Sam?	I don't know.  When I met my wife, it was so clear.  I just <u>knew</u>.

1 Hey, my plate is full.	Well, okay.  What's the big deal?  If she'll forget the new fireplace, I'll marry her. Just point me in the right direction.

1 The hopes are perfect -- beautiful, identical, smooth -- and they are for something really amazing I feel it in my bones --	It's a spice rack.
2 We desperately need a spice rack.  Desperately.

1 "Dear Sleepless in Seattle: I am an SWF"--  What is that?	Thank God.  Something you don't know.  It's a single white female.
2 This is no good.  She's looking for someone French.  Or Greek.  "Dear Sleepless in Seattle: I live in Tulsa." Where is that? --	Oklahoma.  Do you know where that is?
3 Somewhere in the middle.	I'm not going to think about what they're not teaching you in school.  I am not going to think about it.  Generally speaking I think we should rule out people who don't live somewhere near here --
4 She's willing to fly anywhere.

1 Dad!	Everyone thinks Brooks Robinson is the greatest.
2 It's a sign.	Oh, right.

1 Dad, I was talking to Jessica about reincarnation, and she thinks that probably you knew Annie in another life.	Who is Annie?
2 The one who wrote us.

1 Hi, Sam.  And let me guess -- you must be Jonah.	Hi.  He should book now because we can get an excursion fare. Jessica's parents are travel agents and --

1 It's a little derivative.	What do you mean?
2 "An Affair To Remember." Did you ever see it? Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr.  Before that it was called "Love Affair With Irene Dunne And Charles Boyer."

1 I mean it. I know your work record. You were in line for foreman when this trouble started -- did you know that? You had a real future with this company, but you let those Reds stir you up. And now they'll sell you down the river. Why don't you wake up, Ray?  That's your name, isn't it, Ray?	No. My name is Quintero. Mister Quintero.

1 Three hours! Just to heat enough water to wash this stuff!  I tell you something. If this strike is ever settled -- which I doubt -- I don't go back to work unless the company installs hot running water for us.  It should've been a union demand from the beginning.	Yeah.

1 Come on, Esperanza -- how about it? We got to.	No. No. I can't. If Ramn ever found me on a picket line ...

1 First we got to get equality on the job. Then we'll work on these other things. Leave it to the men.	I see. The men. You'll strike, maybe, for your demands -- but what the wives want, that comes later, always later.
2 Now don't start talking against the union again.	What has it got me, your union?

1 Let them take it!	Over my dead body.
2 I don't want your dead body. I don't want you back in jail either.	But it's yours. I won't let them ...
3 Can't you see they want to start a fight so that they can lock you all up at one time?

1 I waited up till midnight.	You weren't waiting for me.
2 That meeting only lasted ten minutes.  The first night I'm home, and you run to the beer parlor. What is it? Can't you bear the sight of me?	Be still ...
3 But you wanted to talk. Tell me.

1 Go on. Spill it.	Well, you're the organizer. You work out strike strategy -- and most of the time you're dead right. But when you figure everything the rank-and-file's to do down to the last detail, you don't give us anything to think about. You afraid we're too lazy to take initiative?
2 You know I don't think that.	Maybe not. But there's another thing ... like when you came in tonight --  I heard you ask your wife, "Who's that? His grandfather?"

1 What you want to do is go back the way you came and make a left at the bottom. It'll take you right to the highway.	That's it?
2 Are you Australian?	No.
3 Good. I fucking hate Australians.

1 What is it?	Nothing, I'm trying to remember...

1 Could be worse.  Oh sorry, forgot who I was talking to.	Ouch.

1 Look, I can't help you with Quincey if that's what you're after.	This has nothing to do with him.
2 So you're just attracted to me, is that it?	Yes. Why do you find that so hard to believe?
3 How much time do you have?	What is wrong with you?
4 How much time do you have?

1 No, you're wrong, I tried to tell myself the same thing but I could have gotten up. I could have done something.	They would have killed you too.
2 Nothing could be worse then this slow death I'm living now.

1 All right, Nancy, how'd you track me down?	Billy Sutcliffe said he saw you at a bar down in Gardena a few weeks ago. Said you looked so bad, he barely recognized you.

1 So, why'd you want to see me?	Business.  I need to leave town and I find myself in dire need of some cash.
2 See that?  That's just what I'm talking about.

1 You ever see Queen Elizabeth sleep?	No  You think she's a tweaker?

1 But...I've seen you.	When? When did you ever see me use?
2 This isn't like that Queen Elizabeth question, is it?	You ever notice how I always showed up, in the middle of a binge? Left before it was over? How I sneak away for cap-naps? How when the crank came around to me, I always said I'd just done one?

1 I'm gonna get this developed and send it to the Warren Commission.	Um, I think the Warren Commission has been closed for a while.
2 No shit?  Fuck it.  I'll send it to Oliver Stone then. He'll get them to reopen the bastard.

1 Pooh-Bear. come on, man.  What is this?  It's me, Danny. I thought we had a deal.	Big Bill

1 I've got a hot one.	You go, boy.
2 If it's all the same to you, I'd rather not dish right here in the middle of Crankville.

1 Look, we'll talk to the A.D.A.	When?
2 Soon. I promise.  We'll get the charges dropped and you can disappear.  In the mean time, trust me, he has no idea that you ratted him out.

1 What? Is it bad?	I'm afraid so, Danny.
2 Who is it?

1 I'll tell you why you didn't help - because you're a chickenshit tweaking snitch.  You're a bottom feader, Flynne.	Garcetti, you're teeth, they're fucking perfect.

1 You're lucky, Flynne.	Funny, I don't feel lucky.
2 We're coordinating with Palmdale P.D.. We'll have your sorry ass covered.	What if he caps me before you can make a move?

1 You think that's a good idea?	What do you mean?
2 Look at that place. It's creepy.

1 Danny, listen up.  Here's the deal ... my wife's pimp knows a guy who works at Cedars Sinai medical lab.  They're getting a very special delivery a week from this Friday.	What is it, drugs?
2 Better than drugs.

1 Thirty-ought-six, Norton long-barrel with dual-groove, parallel rifling, elevated three-glass scope and a single-throw hammer.	The Army gave you that?
2 Yep.	You must be a hell a shot.
3 Not where I come from.

1 So, that's Ryan.	Looks like a flaming asshole to me.

1 Captain, my feet are most uncomfortable.  If I'd 'a known we was gonna have to walk all the way to Ramelle, I never would 'a volunteered for this here mission.	You didn't volunteer, Jackson.
2 I most likely would have, sir, had I been given the opportunity.

1 Sorry, sir, fresh out of trucks, how 'bout a '38 Ford Roadster, hard-top, red with black interior.	White-walls?
2 No white-walls, sir, there's a war on.  NOT THERE, YOU GODDAMNED IDIOT, OVER THERE!  I can't help you, sir.	A half-track, anything.
3 Sorry, sir.  Division is using everything on wheels to get up to Caen.  How come you guys aren't going?

1 Over three-hundred.	I'll tell you what, if I'm still alive when it hits five-hundred, I'll let you know and we'll split the money.
2 If that's the way you feel, why don't we wait until it's up to a thousand.	I don't expect to live that long.

1 What'd you say, Captain?	I teach English at Addley High School in Addley, Pennsylvania.

1 Got it, sir.  We gonna go take care of those eighty-eights?	That's not what we're here for.

1 HOLD YOUR FIRE!	Rolls to his feet.  FIRE another BURST.  KILLS the last of the German riflemen.  Doesn't pause.  RUNS onto the field.

1 Uh, oh.	Out of the mouth of babes.

1 General Gavin is going to be very irritated at you, Captain.	Stands on the edge of the woods, almost in a trance.

1 I've given this a lot of thought, sir.  The best thing that could happen is, we find Ryan and he's dead.	Why's that?
2 Well, sir, consider the possibilities. A:  Ryan is alive.  We have to take him back to the beach.  Knowing you, you don't let him carry my gear, even though he really should, and we all get killed, trying to keep him alive.	Except for the last part, that one's not bad.
3 B:  Ryan is dead.  He's been blown up by the German equivalent of Wade, whose name I know you don't want me to mention.  There's nothing to find. The biggest piece is the size of a pea.  We wander around, looking for him until the Germans pick us off, one after another.	I don't like that one.
4 Neither do I, sir.  C:  And this is the worst one, we find Ryan and he's wounded.  Not only does he not carry my gear, we have to carry his gear. And him.	But we accomplish the mission.
5 Maybe.  But what if he dies on the way back?  you see what I'm saying, sir?  The best possible situation is, he's dead, we find his body, more or less intact, we grab one of his dog-tags and high-tail it back to the beach, or better yet, we head over to Caen and catch up with division.	Has anyone ever told you, you're officer material?
6 No, sir.	That's a mystery to me.

1 I wonder if his cabin is still available?	That's not where I am.  Miller No? Where are you?

1 You set?  Sarge nods.	Yes, sir.

1 Hell, I don't mind this mission, sir, as long as there's something up at Ramelle for...	...for you to blow up, yeah, yeah, we heard that.

1 I don't know, I kind of like Wade's idea about the cruise ship.  I've never been to Tahiti.	What about you, Captain?

1 I'm sorry, but they turned down your card.	Oh yeah, let me give you another card.
2 Okay, thanks.

1 That's unlikely.	The movies are a good second date, you know, as a date?
2 But you never had a first date.	Yes I did- I sat across from her in a mall.  We ate together.  We ate, that's eating, sharing an important physical event.
3 That's not even a scam.	What's a scam?
4 Going out as friends.

1 I draw the line at seven un-returned phone calls.	Lloyd, you have to understand her family is being ripped apart. Like you and she were ripped apart.  Like Joe and I were ripped apart.

1 I wrote sixty-three songs this year.  They're all about Joe, and I'm going to play every single one of them tonight.	I just saw Joe.  He's here.
2 Well, you don't have to be so dramatic about it.

1 Dad, you have to teach me to suture this weekend.	Okay, I promise I will.  Just come here a minute, I want to show you something.

1 Well, let me start it.  I'm flying down to Los Angeles on business, and I decide to take her on her first aeroplane.	I knew how planes flew, but I was still a little nervous.
2 Crash paranoia.

1 If I pick it up, we'll only get back together.	Well then don't pick it up. You know what's best.

1 Whoa.	Would you hold this for me?
2 Yeah

1 Yeah.	Or, or I could always wear this one.

1 Yeah, just keep going first, keep going around.  Get the feel of it, feel the clutch, when you put it in a little?	Yeah.
2 You know how it'll come out and feel... y'know... little more, little more... Yeah, yeah, that's right.  Go round just at first, keep it in first, just feel it.	I'm doing alright.
3 Yeah.  Now, when you feel like you're confident,...	Yeah?
4 If you'll just maybe ease it into second.	Right.

1 Okay.	Alright, high level air safety tips.  If anything happens, it'll usually be in the first five minutes of the flight, right?
2 Okay.	So when you hear the smoking sign go 'ding', you know everything's going to be okay.
3 Good to know.	Right, I'm just going to keep talking until that ding happens, which is going to be soon.
4 Okay.	Alright, personalised flight care from Corey.  Books, cassettes, magazines, anything?
5 Not right now, thanks.

1 Okay, I'll give here the message.	Okay. She's really pretty great, isn't she?
2 What?	She's really pretty great, isn't she?
3 Yeah, she is.  Good luck.	Okay.  Good afternoon.  Goodbye.
4 Jim Court... no, this is her father.  I'll take...

1 Lloyd.  Lloyd Dobler, I've got you.	How ya doin' Miss Evans?
2 You missed every one of your career counselling sessions.  Call me obsessive, compulsive, but let's do this right now.	No way.
3 Lloyd.	What?

1 I love you man	I love you too.

1 Luck.	War.

1 Every day that goes by, I'm losing money. Every worker that is shot, costs me money - I have to get somebody else, I have to train them -	We're going to be making so much money, none of this is going to matter -
2 It's bad business.	Some of the boys went crazy, what're you going to do?  You're right, it's bad business, but it's over with, it's done.  Occasionally, sure, okay, you got to make an example.  But that's good business.

1 Yeah, all right, don't tell me, I'll go along with it, it's just irritating to me I can't figure it out.	All you have to do is tell me what it's worth to you.  What's a person worth to you.

1 How many?	I don't know, ten or twelve.  That's a good color.  Dark blues, grays.

1 The place produces nothing.  I shouldn't say that - nothing it produces reaches the Army.  That's not all right.	So I'll talk to him about it.
2 He's a friend of yours, you want to help him out. Tell me this, though - has he ever once shown you his appreciation?  I've yet to see it. Never a courtesy.  Never a thank you note.  He forgets my wife at Christmas time -	He's got no style, we all know that. So, we should hang him for it?

1 What?	There's a machinist outside who'd like to thank you personally for giving him a job.

1 That's very generous of you.	Yes.

1 A one-armed machinist, Oskar?	He was a metal press operator, quite skilled.

1 Jesus Christ. Captain Tyler flies out of his seat and into action.	Find me every variation of Himbry and what was the other name...

1 Yes.	Who is this?
2 Cici. Who's this?	Someone who wants to talk to you.
3 Ted? Where are you? Are you drinking? Hold on.

1 You know the story, Gale. Man falsely accused, sent to prison, proved innocent, released back into the real world and never trusted again. Want the exclusive?	Did you do it?

1 My documentary is due on Tuesday.	What's your subject?
2 I WAS A SORORITY SLUT.

1 My screwed up life shouldn't have to bleed onto my friends.	Let us decide that.
2 What about your film? Isn't it due next week? Have you even started it?	It's under control.

1 Need some help, honey.	I got it..

1 You have every right to be upset.	Page 41. "Deputy Dewey oozed with inexperience."
2 I never meant to imply...	How do you know my dim-witted inexperience isn't merely a subtle form of manipulation used to lower people's expectations thereby enhancing my ability to effectively maneuver within any given situation?

1 Maybe they never got here. He could have taken her anywhere.	C'mon. Let's go.

1 Who are you?	That's not the way we play the game.
2 I don't play games.	What if your life depended on it?

1 Lucas and his Romper Room stage.	I got. I got it. FRIDAY THE 13TH, PART 20.

1 That was good.	Yeah, right.

1 The young girl, clutching her bloody chest...drags herself, crawling across wet grass...the killer behind her...raising his knife again.	Popcorn flies as Maureen falls forward, into the aisle, clutching her bloody stomach. She's speechless, unable to SCREAM. She holds her bloody hand out for all to see, begging for help. She stumbles down the aisle. Someone YELLS "Sit down." Maureen turns to several PEOPLE who begin to react. She turns behind her to see the Ghost Face coming at her again...knife raised.
2 The young girl is slashed again.	The knife slices into Maureen again...then again. The theatre audience is starting to take note as the Ghost keeps slashing at her repeatedly with the knife. A horrifying, sickening sight.

1 It's all about sisterhood. Everybody thinks its about partying and blowjobs but...	..we only promote safe rubbered sex.
2 ..it's really about family and tradition...	..harmonica style is okay.
3 I just love being a sister.

1 I just have a hard time with insipid, sexist violence.	We can still Sandra Bullock it.
2 Sandra started without us. We can stay. He kisses her again, then breaks away.

1 Jesus.  Hello?	Hello.
2 Who is this?	Who is this?

1 I don't watch TV and I hate books. Whatta you need?	Does the name Maureen Prescott sound familiar to you?
2 Nope.	Well can you tell me if the woman in this picture looks familiar to you.

1 Whoever it is, now is taking credit for Maureen Prescott's murder.	But we know who killed Maureen Prescott, Billy Loomis and Stu Macher.  I mean, they even told Sidney how they did it!
2 Yeah, but, if I'm not mistaken, you said in your book that Sidney got it wrong before. She accused Cotton Weary of murdering her mother, and he was sent away for it!  Maybe there is a third killer.  Sidney Might know something

1 I told you, I don't know where Sidney is. And even if there was a third killer, Sidney doesn't know about it.	That is for me to decide.  I need to talk to her Mr. Riley, she is a key element in this case.  I have a press conference in an hour, and I need to explain why there are four dead celebrities.

1 Alright Sid, over there is the STAB 3 Production offices. That's where Sarah Darling was murdered last night.	Mm, what a waste of Silicone.  What does my mother have to do with this all Dewey? We're a long way from Woodsboro.

1 They found another note?	Uh-huh. Another News clipping. Another one about Sid's mom. Dewey, whether we like it  or not it looks like we're going to have to  go back into our past.
2 You mean OUR past as in Me and Sid. This has nothing to do with you Gale.	This has everything to do with me Dewey. I was the one who brought the nation's attention to this shit anyway. I'll be damned if I'm gonna sit around and pass on the buck again.
3 Do you really mean it this time Gale?	Yes. Look, let's get something straight Dewey, I got into this shit cause the police came looking for ME. Not cause I'm out to make the SUNRISE STUDIOS SLASHINGS.
4 Why would the police come to you?	Again, I am the author of the definitive book on the Woodsboro murders.!  What about you?
5 What about me?	You said you'd never leave Woodsboro, 'The only place that's real!'  But now you're here. Not with me.  Dewey, I took care of you.  I waited until you were well.  I couldn't stay there, I mean, it's like dog years, one year in Woodsboro is like seven everywhere else.
6 So it's off to London for a week?  New York for a month? L.A Forever?	It was fucking '60 Minutes II'!  I couldn't say no!  I could've been the next Diane Sawyer!
7 What's wrong with just being Gale Weathers? I liked her!	It didn't work Dewey.  We tried,  we're different.
8 You used to say that was our strength.	Dewey, you're not just here because of that second rate K-Mart, straight-to-video version of me, are you?
9 Brace yourself, Gale, all of this is actually not About you.	All of what Dewey?  You do know something, don't you?
10 Off the record.	Always.
11 Two months ago, the Woodsboro police got a call from a woman who said she was with 'Stab 3'.  She wanted to see the file on Sid, for research.	And?
12 The boys said no.  She wouldn't give her name. A month later, the station gets broken into, the file room ransacked.	Someone stole Sid's file?
13 I already removed it.  I think someone on the film was trying to find Sid, and that's the only reason I came here. To make do a little private investigating of my own and make sure no one here was planning anything.	I'm sorry, this is too good!
14 What part of 'Off the record' don't you understand?	Right. Sorry.  Do you think he did it? 
15 I've got my suspicions but still, nothing  you say can ever make me take my eyes off one person.	And who is that?

1 Gale, I know this is a bad time and all but what if we try it out again. The whole relationship thing.	Sure, why not. You did Save my life,Mr. Rielly.

1 Who's phone?	Oh shit it's my cell!

1 Well then, I guess I'll be leaving then.	Oh come on! Why the hostility?
2 Listen Lois Lane, I love your show and all but last month I happened to catch your little segment on me and how my wife left me because I'm a sex addict who enjoys screwing fifteen year old girls. It was a real eye opener my lawyers are still thinking about bringing to your superior's attentions.	They're the ones who approved it.

1 Roman Bridger, director. And brother.  She slammed the door in my face, Sid. Said I was Rina's child and Rina was dead. And it struck me, what a good idea! So I watched her, made a little home movie, a little family film. Seems Maureen, mom, really got around. I mean, Cotton Weary was one thing, everybody knew about that, but Billy's father, that was the key! Your boyfriend didn't like seeing his daddy in my movies. Didn't like it at all. And once I supplied the motive, all the kid needed was a few pointers. Have a partner to sell out in case you get caught, find someone to frame, it was like her was making a movie.	All the nightmares. All the hell I went through was because of you, you spineless bastard!
2 I'm a director Sid, I direct. For example, Angelina over there,  She's my partner. I can convince her to do anything.  We've been dating since I met her in Woodsboro.	Oh my God, Angie Crick? From English class?

1 { a click } I only her you too, Sidney.	Who is this?
2 The question isn't who I am.  The question is, who's with me.

1 I didn't kill anybody.	No one's saying you did.

1 This is the best part, Sid. Billy's got it all figured out. Why do you think we kept your father alive so long? Why did we save you for last?	You know what time it is, Sid? It's after midnight. It's your mother's anniversary. We killed her exactly one year ago today.

1 Did you ride past Casey Becker's house?	No, I didn't. I didn't kill anyone, Sheriff.
2 We're gonna have to keep you, Billy. The governor's got SBI, FBI, and god knows who else on their way down here.

1 Subtlety, Stu. Look it up.	It's okay. We need to talk.

1 Why did you kill my mother?	Why? WHY? Did you hear that, Stu? I think she wants a motive. Hmmm... I don't really believe in motives, Sid. I mean, did Norman Bates have a motive?

1 Popcorn.	You're making popcorn?
2 Uh-huh.	I only eat popcorn at the movies.
3 I'm getting ready to watch a video.	Really? What?
4 Just some scary movie.	Do you like scary movies?
5 Uh-huh.	What's your favorite scary movie?

1 What do you want?	TO SEE WHAT YOUR INSIDES LOOK LIKE.

1 I don't know...	Come on, yes you do.
2 Please..stop...

1 Hi! Gale Weathers. Field Correspondent, INSIDE STORY.	I know who you are, ma'am. How's the eye?
2 Productive. So they're closing down the school?	Well... uh... yes ma'am. For the time being.

1 Shit. It's Neil Prescott's car.	Sidney's father?
2 We gotta get back. Jesus. He's here. What the fuck is he doing here?

1 Did you reach my Dad?	You're sure it was the Hilton?
2 At the airport.	He's not registered. Could he have gone to another hotel?
3 I don't know. I guess.	We'll find him, Sid. Don't worry.

1 That ghost mask is sold at both Kroger's and WalMart. Neither of which keep purchase records.	What about the cellular phone bill?
2 They're pulling Loomis' account. But it'll be morning before we see something. You think he did it?	Twenty years ago I woulda said not a chance. But these kids today... damn if I know.

1 What? What?	Jesus! The camera-hurry!

1 Please. You owe me.	I owe you shit.

1 Are you alone in the house?	That is so unoriginal. You disappoint me, Randy.
2 Maybe that's because I'm not Randy.	So who are you?
3 The question is not who am I. The question is where am I?	So where are you?
4 Your front porch.

1 THE FOG, TERROR TRAIN, PROM NIGHT -- How come Jamie Lee Curtis is in all these movies?	She's the Scream Queen.

1 You're absolutely right. I'm the first to admit it. If this were a scary movie, I'd be the prime suspect.	And what would be your motive?
2 It's 1995 -- motives are incidental.

1 And to celebrate this impromptu fall break, I propose we have a party. Tonight, my house.	Are you serious?
2 My parents are out of town. It'll be like my hurricane bash last year. Nothing extreme. Just a few of us, hangin'.

1 Practice ran late. I'm on my way.	It's past seven.
2 Don't worry. Casey and Steve didn't bite it til way after ten.	I'm not worried.
3 Good, 'cause I wanna swing by BLOCKBUSTER and get us a video. I was thinkin' Tom Cruise in ALL THE RIGHT MOVES. You know, if you pause it just right you can see his penis.	Whatever. Just hurry.
4 Bye.

1 This could be good. What do you think, Sid?	I don't know...
2 Come on. Pathos has it's perks.

1 Hunt? Why would they ask if you like to hunt?	I don't know, they just did.

1 He cuts off the skin if his fingertips. That's why we can't find a single usable print in the apartment.  He's been doing it for quite a while.  Keeps cutting before the papillary line can grow back.	What about the trace on his bank account and the guns?  There must be something to connect him with a past.
2 So far it's all dead ends.  No credit history.  No employment history.  His bank account's only five years old and it started as cash.  We're even trying to trace his furniture, but for now all we know is he's independently wealth, well educated and totally insane.  We may never know how he got that way.

1 It's none of my business anymore.	I thought you might want to be filled in.
2 I'm sure everyone's doing their best.	Yeah.
3 Good.

1 She was... she was on the bed.  She was just sitting on the bed.	Who tied her down?  You or him?
2 He had a gun.  He had a gun... and he made it happen.  He made me do it!  He made me put that... that thing on.  Oh, Christ!  He made me wear it... and... and he told me to fuck her.  He had the gun in my mouth.

1 Where we headed?	You'll see.

1 Somerset...	Because I envy your normal life.  Envy is my sin.

1 You've seen my files, right?  Seen the things I've done?	No.
2 Anyway... I did my time on door-to-doors, and walking a beat.  I did all that shit for a long time.	Good.
3 The badge in my pocket says "detective," same as yours.	I made a decision, because I have to consider the integrity of the scene.  I can't worry whether you think you're getting enough time on the playing field.
4 Yeah, well, all I want is...  Just, just don't be jerking me off.  That's all I ask.  Don't jerk me off.

1 It's my wife.	What?

1 He's preaching.	Punishing.
2 The sins were used in medieval sermons. There were seven cardinal virtues, and then seven deadly sins, created as a learning tool, because they distract from true worship.	Like in the Parson's Tale, and Dante.
3 Did you read them?	Yeah.  Parts of them.  Anyway, in Purgatory, Dante and his buddy are climbing up that big mountain... seeing all these other guys who sinned...
4 Seven Terraces of Purgation.	Right.  But there, pride comes first, not gluttony.  The sins are in a different order.
5 For now, let's just consider the books as the murderer's inspiration. The books and sermons are about atonement for sin.  And, these murders have been like forced attrition.	Forced what?
6 Attrition.  When you regret your sins, but not because you love God.	Like, because someone's holding a gun on you.

1 Just, honestly... have you ever seen anything like this... been involved in anything like this?	No.

1 How do those cockroaches get here so quick?	They pay cops for the inside scoop, and they pay well.
2 Sorry about that... I just...	Oh, it's alright.

1 Modern Homicide Investigation.  In Cold Blood.  Of Human Bondage.  Human Bondage?	It's not what you think it is.
2 The Marquis de Sade and Origins of Sadism.	That is.
3 The Writings of Saint Thomas Aqu... Aquin...	Saint Thomas Aquinas.  He wrote about the seven deadly sins.

1 We could use about fifty more men here.	I'm trying, alright?  Just tell me what we've got.

1 As soon as this is over, I'm gone.	Big surprise.

1 Put your gun down!!	Don't do this... please...
2 Put the gun down, Somerset!

1 I was close once.  It just didn't happen.	It surprises me.  It really does.
2 Any person who spends a significant amount of time with me finds me... disagreeable. Just ask your husband.

1 Why always like this?  Only after the fact... this sudden realization, that if you shoot someone, or stick a knife in them, that person will cease to exist.	Crime of passion.
2 Yes.  Look at all the passion splattered up on the wall here.	This is a done deal.  All but the paperwork.

1 Killed every one -- an' not for food either...Why'd they do a thing like that?	Stealing the cattle was just to pull us out...This here's a murder raid...  It shapes up to scald out either your place...or my brother's.

1 You all right, sergeant?	Dunno...Seems so.
2 Well, go get cleaned up and we'll proceed with the weddin'...

1 It's what we're here for, ain't it?	I thought we were trying to get the girls back -- <U>alive</U>...We jump those Comanches, they'll kill 'em...You know that!

1 I didn't <U>want</U> to tell you...but maybe it's your right to know.	Now mount up, son...

1 Unnt-meah!	We ain't goin'! We ain't goin' without you, Debbie...Ethan, get the horses...I'll try to keep her talkin'...

1 Talk!	A young buck fetched it in late last summer...  Said it belonged to a captive chile of Chief Scar...
2 Scar? Never heard of any Chief Scar.	Me neither...But this buck claimed he was a big war chief with the Nawyecky Comanches.
3 Keep talking.	Scar's band was headin' north...to winter in at Fort Wingate...eatin' agency beef. That's what this buck said...Maybe he lied.
4 And maybe you lie...	In that case you won't find her -- and I won't get my thousand dollars.

1 All right...but I'm givin' the orders...You take 'em or we split up here and now...	Why, sure, Ethan...There's just the one thing we're after...finding Deborah and Lucy...
2 If they're still alive...

1 He's agreed to take you on and share the increase from my herd while I'm gone...I'll be pushin' on tomorrow...	I ain't stayin'...I set out lookin' for Debbie...I aim to keep on...
2 Why?	Because she's my...my...
3 She's your nothin'...She's no kin to you at all!	I always felt like she was...Her folks takin' me in, raisin' me like one of their own...
4 That don't make 'em kin...	All right...I ain't got no kin... I'm goin' to keep lookin' that's all.
5 How? You got any horses, or money to buy 'em...You ain't even got money to buy cartridges...Jorgensen's offering you a good livin' here...

1 That's the way to train 'em. Looks like Mrs. Pauley's goin' to make you a fine beautiful wife...	Cut it out, will ya...

1 Suit yourself...While you're enjoyin' your little conversation, I'll be ridin' out with Senor Fernandez here... The Comanch' medicine country ain't far...there's one camp with a chief named Cicatriz.	Never heard of him...
2 Cicatriz is Mex for <U>Scar</U>...an' he has a white girl in his tepee...Be seein' you...

1 I saw it...And don't try to tell me it was Aunt Martha's or Lucy's...	You don't remember it, but I remember. That was your mother's scalp!

1 They never find that girl.	Yours truly...  And he even has to write his full name...Martin Pauley...not even just <U>Martie</U>!...  I don't care if he <U>never</U> comes back!

1 Why else?	Come on, say it.  You know...

1 Do you know where fuse box is?	In the cellar, I think. Wait, I'll take care of it.

1 Martin, it's not funny!	You know, it's not always easy for me, either.  But at least I try not to give in to each and every neurosis.

1 It's just a feeling.  Don't you sense it, too?	What? What am I supposed to sense?
2 The house - Tommi - something just doesn't jive here...

1 Oh, Ellen.  My sweet Ellen... Of course I knew.	We loved each other once.  Have you forgotten that?

1 Frank Kosinski.  Here's the address.  Go see him.  Ask him.	Thank you.  Elisabeth, I didn't mean to...

1 Mrs. Straub!	I've killed my husband!
2 What?	I think I've killed him.  Martin, my husband, I've killed him!  That is, I'm not sure, but...

1 Twenty-three, to be exact.	I wonder how you guys figure on renovating this whole place.  You can afford to spend some money.  If I was you, I'd spare myself all the hard work.  Besides, didn't you want to start writing again?

1 Do you know that house?	Sir Robert De Lesseps.

1 Here is two sovereigns--I'll give you two more when you show me the pages.	Done.

1 When?	Two weeks, three at the most, Aaaagh! For pity's sake.
2 Take his feet out. Where will you get

1 Well, that will have them rolling in the aisles.	Sad and wonderful! I have a blue velvet cap which will do well, I have seen apothecary with a cap just so.

1 I feel a scene coming on.	Is it about a pirate's daughter?

1 Another little problem.	What do we do now?
2 The show must  you know	Go on.
3 Juliet does not come on for twenty pages. It will be all right.	How will it?
4 I don't know. It's a mystery.

1 God bless you!	Thank you. Let go, there's a good nurse.

1 Your Majesty!	Why, Lord Wessex! Lost your wife so soon?
2 Indeed I am a bride short. How is this to end?

1 "The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars As daylight doth a lamp. Her eyes in heaven Would through the airy region stream so bright That birds would sing and think it were not night. See how she leans her cheek upon her hand. O that I were a glove upon that hand, That I might touch that cheek.	"Ay me."
2 "She speaks.

1 My lady!	Who is there?
2 Will Shakespeare!

1 Oh, Will!	Yes, some of it is speakable.

1 "thou need'st not to be gone."	"I have more care to stay than will to go. Come death, and welcome. Juliet wills it so. How is't my soul? Let's talk. It is not day."

1 You look sad, my lady! Let me take you riding.	It is not my riding day, my lord.
2 Bless me, I thought it was a horse.	I am going to church.
3 I understand of course. It is to be expected.	It is to be expected on a Sunday.
4 And on a day of mourning. I never met the fellow but once at your house.	Mourning? Who is dead, my lord?
5 Oh!--dear God, I did not think it would be me to tell you. A great loss to playwriting, and to dancing.

1 How do I offend, my lord?	By coveting my property. I cannot shed blood in her house but I will cut your throat anon. You have a name?
2 Christopher Marlowe at your service.

1 What do you think?	About what?
2 About this guy, this Hugo person.	I don't have time.
3 I'm only asking what you think.	I don't have time to discuss it now. I don't care so long as he's not a freak.

1 I don't know.	Look, if I draw the short straw, then I'll do it, but I'm not going to do it just because you won't.

1 Doesn't it worry you?	No, it doesn't. I tried to let it worry me but it won't. I've worked on that paper for three years. There is a pensioner's terror ordeal on page six every day. Every day. Maybe when I'm a pensioner it'll worry me.

1 What?	I bought the tickets. One for her and one for me. It was my idea.
2 Your idea? Well, that fits. I mean, the two of you, that fits together. I should have seen that long ago.

1 Cameron.	Cameron?
2 Yes.	Really?

1 Aroused and inflamed.	Alex.
2 He even signs them, in his own name, can you believe it? I'd sign someone else's name. I'd sign his name. If I wrote them, that is. Which I don't.

1 Whoever draws the short straw does it all. That way, you either do it or you don't. All or nothing.	OK.
2 David?

1 You know, you should spend some of that money instead of worrying about it. That's my advice.	He's right. You'd feel much better about it.

1 Are you all right?	Yes, of course. Why wouldn't I be?

1 Good evening. I'm Detective Inspector McCall and this is DC Mitchell. I wonder if we could ask you some questions.	What about?
2 It's about the burglary.	Burglary?
3 Downstairs.	Of course.
4 Can we come in?

1 Just get on with it, Alex.	Keep it going, Alex. You're unstoppable now.

1 We already know. All about it.	It was on the television.

1 What do you do?	Well, I've been away for a bit, travelling, that sort of thing, and now I'm trying to write a novel.
2 What's it about?	A priest who dies.
3 I see.	Yeah. Well, maybe I'll change it.
4 No.	Yes, I mean, who wants to read about another dead priest? It's about some other guy, some guy who's not a priest, who doesn't die. You see, it's better already.
5 Writing seems easy.	It's a breeze.

1 You can tell by the intonation.	One other thing. Do you have any tattoos?

1 That girl's making an awful spectacle of herself.	What do you expect me to do about it?
2 I just thought you'd like to know --	Why would I like to know if there's nothing I can do about it, goddammit --

1 And listen, I'll be right back and I want your ass in that bed when I get back.	You're very rude... if you don't come back --
2 I'll be back in a while.	I don't want to see you anymore.
3 I'll be right back, baby, really.

1 Hi.	Hello, George.

1 Shit.	Hello.

1 Oh yes. Mrs. Shumann called about you.	Right.
2 How is she?	Great.
3 Wonderful woman.	She is.
4 I went to school with her husband.	Great.
5 So you want to go in business for yourself?	Right.
6 And you need money?	Right, that's right.
7 You do know what money's like these days.	Well, yeah... you know.

1 How long you had this?	Oh, about six weeks now... Lester -- well, he's very sweet.
2 I'm sure.	He's a very private person, actually.
3 Yeah -- he doesn't happen to know that we went together, does he?

1 No.	Why not?

1 It'll ruin everything.	I know... you don't know, I know.
2 Don't, don't, don't...

1 -- you are.	Fuckin' A --

1 -- we're kidding ourselves.	-- we are?
2 -- last night I dreamt I was fifty years old and Mary told me I was supposed to meet Jill at the shop. It seared me shitless.	Why?
3 I can't imagine being with Jill when she's fifty years old. I can't imagine not being with you.

1 I can't even stand to talk to her on the phone.	She's heavy.  See, Norman expects me to get in here, take care of all the customers and then do his show out in Norwalk. I gotta have my own shop, just out of self defense.

1 Hi, George.	Hey, baby, what's happening?
2 Nothing, I reconciled with Ron, you know, the guy I divorced last summer.	Great, great. I hope you make it.

1 Will we live together?	We live together now.
2 But in the same house, you know, one house.	-- Sure.

1 Jill says nothing.	Where's your car?
2 A friend dropped me off.	Who?
3 Never mind. Where've you been?	A business meeting, I told you that.

1 Let go of me or I'll scream, I'll call the police.	Oh, Christ.

1 What're you here for?	-- A wash and set.
2 No.	No?
3 You need a cut.	But Mr. Norman said --
4 Said what!	I just needed a wash and set, a wash and set, that's all.
5 Well, baby, I'm George and it needs to be cut.  But I don't want to place you in that position either.

1 When?	When?

1 Well -- I could try. Do you wash your hair every day?	Isn't that bad for it?
2 No it keeps the skin peeling. You've got to keep the follicles open. You lose hair and the skin grows over the follicle and that's how you lose it.

1 ... You can lose it all; you can lose it all no matter who you are... I don't know, what's the point of having it all. Look at me. I don't have a goddam thing... the market's terrible right now, went down ten points last week, goddam Lyndon Johnson!	Oh yeah...
2 Yeah,, it goes up a little and then it goes down, maybe Nixon will do something. What's the difference, they're all a bunch of jerks. I wouldn't let 'em run my business, I can tell you that much. Not if I had any choice in the matter.  I don't know what to do with you. I don't know, I don't know what's right or wrong anymore.	I don't either, Lester, I swear to you I don't.
3 What about Jackie?	What about her?
4 I mean, how did that happen?	Lester, it just happened.
5 She's nothing but a whore.	No --
6 Just a whore, I go over there, have a few drinks and get my gun off. I'm through with her, she's nothing but a whore.	No, man, no. You can say everybody's a whore. She's okay. I mean Jackie'll fuck around but not that much. Somewhere she really likes you, Lester, and it's not just the bread. She's okay.

1 Steve Slutes, and he's not a boy.  Steve couldn't get arrested as an actor. He couldn't get arrested as a boy.	Then you were talking to him.
2 I ran into him at the 76 station on little Santa Monica, what was I supposed to do, hide in the ladies room? Yes, I was talking to him.

1 Here.	Aren't you going to have one?
2 No.	Why not?
3 Because I don't want one.

1 Well, he is.	So what's your point?
2 Jill, I'm just trying to be helpful.	I know, I'm sorry.
3 I spent three years with him. I just couldn't take it not knowing who was gonna pay the rent... his unemployment or mine. George was adorable but it drove me crackers. Now at least I'm comfortable. Lester does what he says he'll do. Maybe you're happy living like a gypsy. Are you?	George is great but I know what you mean.
4 Face it, you can go around with cute guys and get hung up on their sexy bodies and things like that but sooner or later you've got to find somebody. Face it, time isn't on your side.	I guess not.

1 -- oh, sure. A hairdresser. How... how do you a... meet a hairdresser?	Getting your hair done...  Would you like to go to a party?
2 Not with your hairdresser.

1 You're kidding.	Those Arabs won't be when they start chasing you around the sand dunes.
2 Johnny!  Why didn't you tell me before?	-- just before I ask you out? I can't do that. Let's get out of here before good old Les catches up with us again.

1 No!	John...

1 Can I go to my room and get my fire-engine?	Come here for a minute, first.

1 Do you like ice cream, Doc?	Yeah.

1 Yeah.	Do you really want to go and live in that hotel for the winter?
2 Sure, Danny, it will be lots of fun.	Yeah, I guess so.  Anyway, there's hardly anybody to play with around here.
3 Yeah, I know.  It always takes a little time to make new friends.

1 It's so pretty.	Yeah.
2 I didn't think it was going to be this big, did you?	No.

1 Now Danny, when you were brushing your teeth, do you remember if you smelled anything funny, or saw any bright flashing lights, or anything at all strange?	No.
2 Do you remember when you were brushing your teeth?	Yes.

1 Tony.	Did Tony's first appearance happen to coincide with your arrival here?
2 No, um let's see I guess Danny started talkin to Tony about the time we put him into nursery school.

1 Yes, sir.  I have a wife and eh two daughters, sir.	And, er... where are they now?
2 Oh, they're somewhere around.  I'm not quite sure at the moment, sir.

1 Good evening.  Forest Service.	Hallo, this is Dick Halloran again. I called a while ago about the folks at the Overlook Hotel.

1 Bill, how do you do?	Pleased to meet you.
2 Pleasure to meet you.

1 I'm the kind of man likes to know who's buying their drinks, Lloyd.	It's not a matter that concerns you, Mr. Torrance - at least not at this point.

1 Well, something'll come.  It's just a matter of settling back into the habit of writing every day.	Yeah... that's all it is.

1 He's still asleep.	Good.

1 Have you ever thought about my responsibilities?	Oh Jack, what are you talking about?
2 Have you ever had a single moment's thought about my responsibilities? Have you ever thought for a single solitary moment about my responsibilities to my employers?

1 Mr. Ullman?	Yes?
2 I'm Jack Torrance.	Oh, well - come on in Jack.

1 The police eh... they thought that it was what the old-timers used to call cabin-fever, a kind of claustrophobic reaction which can occur when people are	shut in together over long periods of time.
2 Well, that is eh quite a story.

1 This is the staff wing of the hotel. None of the other bedrooms are heated during the winter.	Oh!

1 What time does the plane leave?	Eight thirty.
2 Well, that still gives up plenty of time to go over everything first.

1 What's the money for?	A new pair of panty hose. Is it enough?
2 I don't want your money. You're a booger.	It was Brady's idea, Jane. Honest to God. Please take the money. I want to make up.

1 I used to see her every day, and she never knew what was going to happen to her, and neither did I! I mean I know how stupid that sounds, but...	Hey, take it easy. I know how you feel.

1 Your mom's not around, is she?	She and dad are out back lighting the barbecue. Jane's walking around like she's King Shit of Turd Mountain. Like always.
2 Uh-huh. Only in her case I guess it would be Queen Shit of Turd Mountain. Hand me that adjustable.

1 Well... it's a lot easier to swallow without the hair and the foaming jaws. Also, I checked on the otic solution. It was counter brand. No prescription needed.	I told you!
2 Shut up, dear boy- no gloating allowed.

1 So have I, actually... I wish it could always be like this.	See me around to my car, Marty, and make sure I stay out of trouble at least that long.

1 But how?	BY A VOICE YOU HEAR FROM ON HIGH
2 I think I hear it!	LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED
3 You know, I just might!	LET THY SOUL BE HEALED

1 What do you want?  This is a private area!  Get lost!	You ain't got nothin' I ain't seen.
2 Then stop trying to memorize it.  Hit the road.

1 No... it's fine.	Yes?
2 Thanks.  A lot.	Is that why you came up here, Christy? To thank me?
3 Sure.	And to say you're sorry.  About this afternoon.  And the things you said. Forgotten.  Completely.  Do you understand?  Forgotten.
4 Right.  Yeah.  Forgotten.

1 Mary Clarence.  Goose.  We're completely self-supporting.  Like all convents. Like yours.	Oh, right.  At my old place, we used to... wash cars.  Groom dogs.  So... nice loom.
2 Isn't it lovely?  Now I'll demonstrate, and then you can hop right in.  You just draw your beater in, keep it pressed against the pick, and open the shed.  Then pass your shuttle, beat, and open the next shed.  Shuttle. beat, beat, shuttle, beat, shed.  Keep tension on the warp.  Is that clear?	Just about.  Show me again.
3 You betcha.

1 We know you don't want to bring pain and misery to your friends and neighbors. We'll pray to find you some honest work.	And we know that, even though most people would call you a leech and a parasite, the lowest slug of humanity! We know that deep down inside, you're probably even worse.  And so you truly need our prayers.

1 Sure.  Kind of... free-lance.	Free-lance?  Oh really?  You think I don't see?  You think I took vows yesterday?  I know what you're up to. You and Reverend Mother.
2 What?	You're a ringer.  She brought you in to replace me.  Out with the old.

1 Van Cartier.	You know?  About me?  About everything?

1 We must do this sacred thing, Mary Robert.	Of course!  We must do it!  It's the will of God!  What is it?
2 We must... get you some experience.  We must... leave this place.	Are you sure?

1 Goddamn it!	Mary Clarence!

1 Wait, this isn't the way.  Who are you?	They're from my old convent.

1 Cool.  Is there a menu?  Or buffet?	Before we do, you might like to freshen up.  And you'll certainly want to change
2 Deal.

1 You were right the first time.  Is this like, solitary?  The cooler?  Where's the furniture?	Our lives are simple.  We have little need for material possessions.
2 Right, sure thing.  But what about, like, appliances?  Like a little color portable?  Boom box?	Useless distractions.
3 It's like the Stone Age.  The room time forgot.  What about a phone?	And whom would you call?
4 Oh, I don't know... Satan?	Your cell is more than adequate.
5 Right.  So what do we do now?  Ping- Pong?  Row over to the monastery?	It is nine p.m.  Pleasant dreams.
6 Wait.  No.  You're kidding.  Lights out? At nine?  My day's just starting.	I'm sure.  If I were you, I would use this time, to think about my life.  And its direction.  Or lack thereof.
7 What's wrong with my life?	From all I've heard, just about everything.  Your singing career seems all but nonexistent, and your married lover wants you dead. 

1 You will sing, and you will sleep,' that is your schedule until you depart.  As almost no one attends Mass, you will be unable to cause further damage.	No.  No.
2 You're my Olympic event.	Not the choir, please, anything but that.  The choir -- I mean, have you heard them?  I'll do anything, scrub floors, toilets, you name it, but not that I
3 The choir, Mary Clarence.  Go for the gold.

1 Then I guess you're stuck.  Life sentence.  No parole.	Very well.  I hold you responsible for all of this, For introducing a lounge act into my convent.  For utterly disrupting our way of life.  And for placing all of us in mortal danger.  Thank-you.

1 I hate you.  I totally hate you.	Safest place in the world.  You think Vince would look for you here?

1 I've got to go.	Just remember - you're a target.  Don't you think Vince has a T.V.?
2 I know, I know.  I'll be careful.  I'll try.

1 Then one day they find you.	They open a window.

1 But, Vince, how do you know she didn't like, join up and become a nun when she was in that convent?	It didn't happen.

1 So that guy in the bar was right?  She's like... some kind of nun?	Yeah, right -- when I see it.

1 Look what she did with the choir.  She made us sing beautifully.	That should have tipped us.

1 Mary Clarence has a background in music. That's what Reverend Mother said.	Really, Mary Clarence?  Were you a choirmistress?

1 An... entertainer?	She wasn't a nun?

1 Reverend Mother?	Yes?
2 Since Mary Clarence came to St. Katherine's, I've been shot at, kidnapped by Mafia hit men, and I've tasted beer. Is that enough experience yet?  For final vows?

1 Where?	Find 'em!

1 They spend two days in chains.	Two days... ?  For murder?

1 ... help yourself, you pompous ass. I will be in bed.	Would you stay, doctor?  I may need assistance.

1 Just a moment...  Are you saying it is he?	When a goblin leaps from the nether world, others follow.  Poltergeists of the air, water and earth follow and cheer his desecrations!

1 There is a farming community upstate, Constable... ten days journey north in the Hudson Highlands.  It is named Sleepy Hollow.  Within a fortnight, three persons have been murdered there. Each with their head lopped cleanly off.  The elders of the Hollow have sent dispatches to me, requesting assistance, and now, just this very moment, I have chosen you.	Chosen me?
2 These "methods" of yours... there has been no practical application.	Not for lack of trying.
3 Just so.  Granted.  And so you take your experimentations to Sleepy Hollow and catch the murderer who has tainted the place.  Bring him here to face our good justice. Will you do this for me?	I shall, gladly.
4 Excellent.  Then, you are excused till morning.

1 Listen to what you say....	No, you listen!  You may think we are a pack of superstitious dullards...
2 At times I do.

1 If the Western Woods are truly the Devil's Glen, we will see for ourselves.	Father said witches live there.
2 Witches do not exist.  However...

1 If someone has the Horseman's skull... if they control the Horseman, then why haven't they sent him for your head yet?	Because, I serve a fine purpose alive. It is perfection for our murderer if I return to New York City with nothing more than tales of a galloping ghoul.  We must uncover the reason these victims were targeted.  What was taken from them... other than their lives? Who benefits by their deaths?

1 Won't you change your mind, sir? What can I say to convince you?	Nothing.  To hell with this place and all the people here.

1 I've read a great deal about your New York City.  Do be a dear and tell me all about it.  Sounds like an extraordinary place to live a life.	Extra ordinary, yes.  But first, you tell me about the Headless Horseman.

1 You falter with your answer because you strive without putting the whole of your heart into it.  Can't you see? You'll bring dignity to the dead even if you have to chop them into little pieces to do it.	If it had been surgery on a living person, done to save that person's life, you would not question it.  Not for a moment.  So, let me be the first to tell you, dear girl... on the other side of these sheltering mountains, a whole world has advanced beyond such plebeian thinking as yours.  And someday, no matter how much you fear it, that world will come to roust Sleepy Hollow out of its slumber.

1 What is so urgent?	Come with me.

1 Returning to the Western Woods?	Yes, actually.
2 Use caution.	Do you know... I think those are the first words I have heard from you my entire time here.
3 As my husband says, a wife should be always like an echo, and at the same time, quite unlike an echo.  Like an echo, she should speak only when spoken to, and unlike an echo, should never try to have the last word, or, at least that is what he believes.

1 Pardon.  You did not answer when I knocked.  Are we intruding?	You are from the Hollow?
2 In a way, yes.

1 All right then, I'll see y'all later. Karl you done a good day's work. They right about you. Scooter, he's gonna knock you out of a job if you're not careful. I'll see you tomorrow.	Wait up, I'll leave with you and lock up.
2 Karl, they's a blanket up in under that cot and soap in the bathroom to clean up with.  Now there's one more thing. The way we lock these doors at night, you can't get out. You didn't want to go anywhere, did you?

1 Hey Jerry, how it's goin'. Good to see you. Been a long time.	Good to see you, Bill. How's everybody doin'?
2 Aw, pretty good. Kids are drivin' me crazy and Phyliss is gonna put me in the poorhouse. Can't complain other than that. Wouldn't do any good if I did.  Do you know Scooter, Jerry?	No, don't guess I do.  Scooter, good to meet you.  This is him, the one I talked to you about on the phone. Now like I said, I'll understand if you get nervous about it. I'm not gonna lie to you now, he did get in that trouble but then he was real young.
3 I remember it real well. Cut them folks to pieces. His mama one of 'em.

1 ... on the third day I washed her. She wasn't very clean. I got all the right spots. She was the first one I ever kept for any length of time, you see I get bored easily, I have a short attention span. I can't say she enjoyed her stay, although the washcloth in her mouth held in place by good duct tape kept any complaints to a minimum. I don't really like people who talk a lot. I like to do the talking. I guess that's why I'm so fond of you. You're so easygoing, although I do sense a little tension in you sometimes. By the way, how was it out there? Did you have any fun? Make any new acquaintances? Tell me what it was like.	They was a boy. We made friends.
2 I bet you did. I was never bent that way. I'm bent the other way. So, you liked it out there in the world.	It's too big.
3 Well, it's not too big in here, is it?  I feel very generous today. I feel like listening. I'm sure you have plenty to tell me. And please bore me with the details.  ) Come on Karl, who did you kill? Was it the boy?	Don't say nothin' about that boy.

1 I thought I told everybody to get out of my house. That includes cocksuckers and retards. Get off your asses and go.	This is not your house, Doyle. This is my house and I'll say who stays and goes. You've got a house, why don't you go get one of your girlfriends and go home to it.
2 You know better than to talk like that when I'm hurtin'. Don't make me knock the piss out of you.

1 Come on, Karl, let's go out to the garage.	Goddamnit, I'm talkin' to the man. You set right there, Karl.

1 I'd better go on home now, it's late. I have to work tomorrow.	Come on, don't be a pussy. Everybody has to work.

1 On the bass, give it up for Terence "One Ball" Atkins.  On the tambourine and lyrics Morris Hobbs the fuckin' genius of the group.  On drums "The Johnson."  And last and most importantly, Doyle Hargraves on rhythm guitar and business affairs and the only motherfucker with a truck big enough to haul this outfit on the next world fuckin' tour. Come on, a big hand for these guys. They're workin' their asses off here.  Okay I'd like to dedicate this next one to some very special people in our audience tonight. To my lovely female companion Linda, her lovely son Frank, our new boarder Karl - what's your last name Karl?	Childers.
2 Karl Childers just in from the state facility. Make one of them gruntin' sounds Karl or whatever it is you do.  Oh well, Karl's a little retarded, he don't know what the hell I'm talkin' about. And to Vaughan who fucks a mortician in the rear entrance right in front of his clients. Now that takes balls. Our number one tune for the folks, boys. Kick it off Johnson!

1 Wait a minute. You want to go with me? You can meet my mama.	I don't want to worry your mama with company.
2 Aw, come on. You'll like her. She's real nice. She'll give us somethin' if we ask her to. Candy or somethin'.	I was kindly needin' to do some tradin'. Reckon they sell toothpaste?
3 They sell some of everything. Come on let's go. I won't tell her about you bein' in the state hospital for killin'.

1 I know you could of scored them three touchdowns by yourself instead of throwing 'em over to me.	Them boys was tryin' to pull me down pretty hard.
2 You're strong though. You let me make them touchdowns so I'd feel good. My daddy used to do that kind of thing.

1 I sure like the way he talks. It sounds like a race car motor idlin'. It makes me not be nervous.	I'm glad of it, honey.

1 I'm ye boy.	I ain't got no boy.
2 I'm ye oldest boy name Karl.	I ain't got no boy.
3 They turned me aloose from the nervous hospital. Said I was well.

1 Two fellers was on a bridge a takin' a leak and one feller says the water was cold and the other said it was deep water. One of 'em came from Arkansas, I believe.	I'll be dog.

1 Okay, Karl, the reason I brought you here was to talk to you about something that is on my mind.  I guess I'll put it right out on the table. Where do I start. Linda and Frank are very important to me. They're like family. My own family was never like family. They're horrible people. As a matter of fact I prayed every night for years that my father would die. I finally realized through a lot of therapy that I was wasting my energy on hating him. Now I just don't care.  You see, you and I are a lot alike, strange as that may seem. I mean not physically or even mentally really, just well, maybe emotionally or actually the hand we've been dealt in life. We're different. People see us as being different anyway. You're -- well you have your affliction or whatever and I, well mine's not as easy to see. I'm just going to say it. I'm gay.  Does that surprise you?  That I'm gay. You know what being gay is, don't you?	I reckon not.
2 Homosexual. I like men. Sexually.	Not funny, ha, ha, funny queer.
3 Well that's a very offensive way to put it. You shouldn't say that. You were taught that, weren't you?	I've heard it said that way.
4 Anyway, it's hard to live gay, that's the right way to say it, in a small town like this. I've wanted to leave many times, but my love for Linda and Frank and another certain person that we won't go into have kept me from it. Anyway, I'm rambling. If you're going to live in the Wheatly garage you need to know that it won't be easy. Doyle is a monster. Not just a closed minded redneck, but a monster. A dangerous person. I've told Linda that one day that man is going to really hurt her or that boy. Maybe even kill one of them. I see it in his eyes. I'm very in tune, maybe even psychic. Doyle will make your life hell. You're a perfect target. When I first saw you I was afraid of you. Not really afraid, I guess, just taken aback. But also, I felt a real sensitive feeling from you. And for some reason, Frank has adopted you. Much like a stray animal. I'm sorry, I didn't mean it like that. In a good way. Anyway, I just want you to know what you're in for. I have a good feeling about you. You're good for Frank. Maybe it's that he can have an adult friend on a child's level. I'm sorry, I didn't mean it in a bad way.  There's one more thing. It's none of my business why you were in the state hospital. Everyone has something in their past, maybe you tried suicide, maybe you did something -- terrible. But what I see before me is a gentle, simple man. All I want you to promise me is that you're capable of being around Linda and Frank. You know. You would never hurt them under any circumstances, would you?	I wouldn't never hurt them.
5 That's what I thought. I hope I haven't offended you in any way. You seem like a thinker. You seem to always be in deep thought. Tell me something. What are you thinking right now?

1 Listen everybody, I know this may sound corny, I've had a few glasses of wine and that kind of makes me a little emotional, but I'm going to say it anyway. It just came over me in a rush. I want you all to know that I care about each and every one of you at this table.	That's very sweet of you Vaughan. We care about you, too. Don't we y'all?

1 It's coming along. At the rate he's going, he'll have a story finished by the end of the summer.	Wonderful. When your next book is published, maybe you could come into the store and do a signing. I'm sure we could get a lot of people to show up.

1 And what about for you?	Huh?
2 What about for you?	For me?  I'll have the same thing. 
3 Do me a favor, will you?	What's that, Sol?
4 Next time, when you want two corned beef sandwiches, say, "Two corned beef sandwiches." When you want two ginger ales, say, "Two ginger ales."	What's the difference?
5 It's simpler, that's what. It makes things go faster.	Uh, sure, Sol. Anything you say. Instead of saying, "One corned beef sandwich," and then, "Another corned beef sandwich," I'll say, "Two corned beef sandwiches."
6 Thanks. I knew you'd understand.

1 The kid's sorry, Auggie.	Yeah, well, I'm sorry too.  It took me three years to save up those five thousand bucks, and now I'm broke. I can't hardly pay for this beer. Not to speak of having my credibility destroyed. Do you understand what I'm saying? My credibility. So yeah, I'm sorry, too. About as sorry as I've ever been in my whole fucking life.
2 He's got something to tell you, Auggie.	If he's got something to tell me, why don't he tell it to me himself?

1 I have to pee.  If the waiter comes, order me a corned beef on rye and a ginger ale, okay?	You got it.

1 What's this?	Why don't you open it and find out?
2 Jesus God, Auggie. There's money in here.	Five thousand bucks.
3 And you're giving it to me?	It's all yours, baby.
4 For keeps?	For keeps.
5 I can't believe it. Oh God, I can't believe it.  You're an angel, Auggie. An angel from heaven.

1 How'd you do out there, Jimmy?	Good, Auggie. Real good.  All finished.
2 It'll never be finished.	Huh?
3 That's how it is with sidewalks. People come, people go, and they all drop shit on the ground. As soon as you clean up one spot and move on to the next, the first spot is dirty again.	I just do what you tell me, Auggie. You tell me to sweep, so I sweep.

1 It's only temporary. On a freelance basis.	And this one, in case you haven't guessed, is Junior.
2 Hi there, little brother.	Say hi to Paul.

1 Okay, joke about it. I don't give a shit.	Jesus, Tommy, it ain't science, you know. You got your good trades and your bad trades. That's how it works.
2 They didn't have to do a thing, that's all I'm saying. The team was good, the best fucking team in baseball. But then they had to screw it up.  They traded their birthright for a mess of porridge.  A mess of porridge.

1 Time to wake up.  Hey, kid, time to wake up.  Rashid!  Up and out. I have to work in here. The slumber party is over.	What time is it?
2 Eight-thirty.	Eight-thirty?
3 You'll find juice and eggs and milk in the refrigerator. Cereal in the cupboard. Coffee on the stove. Take whatever you want. But it's time for me to get started in here.

1 It's 1942, right? And he's caught in Leningrad during the siege. I'm talking about one of the worst moments in human history. Five hundred thousand people died in that one place, and there's Bakhtin, holed up in an apartment, expecting to be killed any day. He has plenty of tobacco, but no paper to roll it in. So he takes the pages of a manuscript he's been working on for ten years and tears them up to roll his cigarettes.	His only copy?
2 His only copy.  I mean, if you think you're going to die, what's more important, a good book or a good smoke? And so he huffed and he puffed, and little by little he smoked his book.	Nice try. You had me going for a second, but no ... no writer would ever do a thing like that.  Would he?
3 You don't believe me, huh?  Look, I'll show you. It's all in this book.

1 Like it or not, Cyrus, that's my name. Cole. Just like yours.	Now ask him who his mother was.

1 But you can't say with any certainty that the blood was his.	No, but as I say, the type is rare. Ten percent of Caucasian males.
2 And the blood could <u>not</u> have belonged to defendant.  Seeing that his type is O negative.	That's obvious.
3 You scraped the dried blood from the <u>butt</u> of the gaff.  Where a fella's <u>hand</u> goes.  And what did you see under your microscope, besides the B positive blood and the wood scrapings...?

1 Now, Mister Gi...	Unwritten rule of the sea.  We don't bother each other, stick to ourselves. Ask anybody.

1 Yes, and then, what was there to call about?  Everything was up in the air.	Up in the air?  Was <u>that</u> your reaction?

1 I can just feel my spirits soar.	Well, I don't do it for just anybody.

1 I felt Milholland's report in my pocket.  And wondered why I wasn't telling her.  Telling someone. What I'd found.	You've been busy with that trial, I suppose.  Such a travesty...

1 So if defendant had tied up to deceased's boat.  With that last one.  Would those cleats have lined up?	You bet.  And if Miyamoto there had been in a hurry to cast off, he coulda left this line behind on Carl's boat.
2 And replaced it later with the new one.  That's your inference?	Pretty darn clear.

1 Well, the freighter.  The twine. The blood.  The knife.  The cup. The watch.  The second battery. The phantom lantern.  The fishing gaff.  The cracked gunnel.  The skull wound.  The blond hair.  That's <u>eleven</u> things...	Twelve.

1 As my wife testified, we were considering it.	Actually, she said you had decided. Decided <u>not</u> not come forward.

1 You mean, early morning the 16th?	No, night of the 16th, morning the 17th.  We replaced two guys named Miller and Milholland.

1 Your daddy.  Was quite a feller.	Yes, he was.

1 If I whistle.  Those boys'll see you, and come runnin'.  <u>You're</u> the story today.	You ever been strangled by a single hand?
2 Naw, I've seen what that can do to a pack of cigarettes.

1 Bet there's a few things you could teach me.  Kendo, for one.	Sure.  I could take a fishing gaff and split your head open. Right above your left ear.

1 You found three batteries, you say.  A D-6 and D-8 in the well. And a spare D-8 on the cabin floor. Correct?	It is.
2 Now I did some measuring down at the chandlery.  A D-6 is one inch wider than a D-8.  It would be too large for the deceased's well.	He's done some on-the-spot refit- ting.  You could see the side flange was banged away to make room for the D-6.
3 But he had a spare D-6, you said. Right there.  Why not use that?	It was dead.  We had it tested. Maybe the D-6 was the spare and he had to use it.

1 For certain, no.	But you are <u>certain</u> that he died by drowning.
2 For the third time, yes.

1 Melton, on the double!  Up a chain!                                   MELTON  Sir!     MELTON takes a few easy strides, gracefully catches a chain mid- stride, and smarts up, climbing easily and twice as fast as TODD.     CHURCH, SLOAN, and RUBRICK crane their necks as the two men struggle upward toward the rafters.     Three quarters of the way up, MELTON comes even with TODD, then passes him. MEKUM, watching, smirks.     CHURCH is watching too, and he's still not satisfied.  His brow is knit, something's bothering him.     ANGLE HIGH ABOVE, AMONG THE GIRDERS     Stonefaced, MELTON is resting an a "platform" on the chain, sixty feet up, beneath the girders, swaying gently.     His stony gaze is on the next chain where TODD is arriving at a "platform" on an adjacent chain...only three feet away.     Their eyes meet, TODD and MELTON alone together sixty feet up, three feet apart.  Neither man blinks, neither man flinches, neither man reveals anything at all...     LOW ANGLE, LOOKING UP     CHURCH considers the men high above, then to MEKUM.                                   CHURCH                    What about...spirit?	Spirit?                          Oh!  You mean "AQ"..."aggressive qualities"?
2 Whatever the latest jargon is.                                   MEKUM Much better, much higher.  For example, where your old ones expressed ninety percent of their sexual energy in aggressive physicality, these new ones are ninety-nine percent without sexual inclination.  It's <u>all</u> aggression.                                   SLOAN                          <u>Real</u> men!                                   CHURCH                          At ease, Lieutenant.                          What if they fought?     A sudden silence.     SLOAN raises her eyebrows, gives RUBRICK a look.     Frowning thoughtfully, MEKUM looks up. MEKUM You mean up there?                                   CHURCH                                             Go ahead, Rube.  Tell Todd to take him. MEKUM No!     They all look at MEKUM.  Is this the chink in the armor?  The new soldiers can't fight?                                   CHURCH                    "No"? MEKUM Not fair.  No contest.  Send two more of your old ones up.     Now CHURCH, RUBRICK, and SLOAN are stunned.  They exchange a glance.                                   MEKUM Go ahead.

1 Upsy-daisy.	Fresh!

1 What happened?	Me and Tiny, we had them cornered - but we lost 'em in the shuffle.
2 Where were you guys?

1 All the way to Urbana - for a one night stand?	It's twelve bucks.  We can get one of the overcoats out of hock.

1 Who are we kidding?  Look at that - look how she moves - it's like jello on springs - they must have some sort of a built-in motor. I tell you it's a whole different sex.	What are you afraid of?  Nobody's asking you to have a baby.  This is just to get out of town. The minute we hit Florida, we'll blow this set-up.
2 This time I'm not going to let you talk me into something that...

1 Men?	Oh, you don't have to worry about that.
2 We would be caught dead with men.  Those rough, hairy beasts with eight hands -  They all want just one thing from a girl.

1 He's not only got a yacht, he's got a bicycle.	Daphne -  Go on - tell me all about him.

1 I feel like such a tramp - taking jewelry from a man under false pretenses.	Get it while you're young.  And you better fix your lips.  You want to look nice for Osgood, don't you?

1 All right - so what do we do now?	First thing we got to do is get out of these clothes.

1 Oh - Sugar!	I wanted to thank you for covering for me. You're a real pal.
2 It's nothing.  I just think us girls should stick together.	If it hadn't been for you, they would have kicked me off the train.  I'd be out there in the middle of nowhere, sitting on my ukulele.
3 It must be freezing outside.  When I think of you - and your poor ukulele -	If there's anything I can do for you -
4 Oh, I can think of a million things -

1 Here you are, Sugar.	A bunch of us girls are going for a swim. Want to come along?
2 You betcha.

1 We don't have to run.	Oh yes, we do!

1 How did those holes get there?	Oh - those.  I don't know.  Mice?

1 It certainly is delightful to have some young blood around here.	Personally, I'm Type O.
2 You know, I've always been fascinated by show business.	You don't say.
3 Yes, indeed.  It's cost my family quite a bit of money.	You invest in shows?
4 No - it's showgirls.  I've been married seven or eight times.	You're not sure?
5 Mama is keeping score.  Frankly, she's getting rather annoyed with me	I'm not surprised.
6 So this year, when George White's Scandals opened, she packed me off to Florida.  Right now she thinks I'm out there on my yacht - deep-sea fishing.	Well, pull in your reel, Mr. Fielding. You're barking up the wrong fish.

1 This is her roommate.  Daphne can't talk right now.  Is it anything urgent?	Well, it is to me.  Will you give her a message?  I'd like her to have a little supper with me on my yacht after the show tonight.
2 Got it.  Supper - yacht - after the show - I'll tell her.  Your yacht?

1 Hey, Sig - can we talk to you?	Nellie, get me long distance.  What is it?

1 Yes.  I come from a very musical family. My mother is a piano teacher and my father was a conductor.	Where did he conduct?
2 On the Baltimore and Ohio.	Oh.
3 I play the ukulele.  And I sing too.

1 Well, there they are - more millionaires than you can shake a stick at.	I'll bet there isn't one of them under seventy-five.
2 Seventy-five.  That's three-quarters of a century.  Makes a girl think.

1 Josephine.	Oh, I didn't hear you come in.

1 I just got this motorboat - it's an experimental model.	Looks like they're on the wrong track.
2 Do you mind riding backwards? It may take a little longer -	It's not how long it takes - it's who's taking you.

1 Would you do me a favor?	What is it?
2 I may not be Dr. Freud or a Mayo Brother or one of those French upstairs girls - but could I take another crack at it?	All right - if you insist.

1 Really?	From a rich millionaire.
2 That's wonderful.  Poor Josephine.	Me?
3 Daphne has a beau - I have a beau - if we could only find somebody for you.

1 What'll it be, sir?	Booze.
2 Sorry, sir, we only serve coffee.	Coffee?
3 Scotch coffee, Canadian coffee, sour-mash coffee...	Make is Scotch.  A demitasse. With a little soda on the side.

1 I don't know what you're talking about.	So now I got all those coffins on my hands - and I hate to see them go to waste.
2 Honest, Spats.  I had nothing to do with it.

1 I should get going.	Are you sure youre okay?
2 Im fine. I promise.

1 Say something. Please.	I knew you were still seeing someone else when we finally got together. I never in a million years would have dreamt it was Jeffrey.

1 Whos ever heard of dance lessons for a wedding, honestly?	Um, just about everyone.
2 You are taking the piss?

1 Nothing.	Doesnt look like nothing.

1 Kat, wait. I dont want you hating me. Weve never had this talk. You know how crap I am at this.	Um, news flash: I dont give a shit.
2 Kat, stop it. You do. You cant even look me in the eye. You went back to the States when we split up.

1 What color are my shoes?	You have feet?

1 Six thousand, right?	On the nose.  I tell you what, because youre so cute, Ill take care of our incidentals.
2 How does it feel to get that much money just for being you?	Great, with the occasional stabs of shame. Now, listen, this covers the weekend, but as we discussed, if you want to be intimate, we talk money before anything happens.
3 That wont be an issue, believe me. I find the idea of sex for money morally repugnant.  No offense.	Its okay. Hell, Ive never paid for it. But please dont feel like you have to explain yourself to me.

1 The real story is that my mother was a hippie. And a stripper. She was insanely inappropriate with me. She used to wash her lingerie in my bathwater. While I was still in the bath.	Oh, no.
2 Yeah. As an adult, I needed to find some way to experience intimacy and sex, but with rules that couldnt be violated.

1 Its hard to explain.	Show me.

1 When I said Id never done a wedding before, I didnt say that no one ever asked. I just never said yes.	So, whyd you say yes to me?
2 There was something in your voice on the phone that day.	Desperation?

1 I should go.	What?! No, no. You cant--
2 I have to.  Im the best man.

1 Dad!	Hi, kiddo.
2 Meet Nick.

1 I am now, sir.	At least somebodys using the damn thing.  I was gonna fix her up but we took one trip and the kids fought so much, we never launched her again.

1 They lived a long time ago -- before you and I were born.	Where is Africa, Miss Johnson?

1 You think about your father a lot, don't you?	Yes mam...
2 Well, you shouldn't worry about him too much, David.	What do I tell my mama when I get home? I didn't find him and that's what I wanted to do.
3 But you did all you could, David. Not many little boys could've gone on such a journey as you did.	But where is my daddy!?
4 I can't answer that for you -- but it's no fault of your own that you don't know where your father is now. You tell me what you did that kept you from finding your father.  Come on, tell me...	Nothin'...
5 And so you did your job, right?	Yes, mam...
6 Whewwww! You sure keep my mind jumping, boy!	What do that mean?
7 Means you keep me using my head, and that's good!

1 Yes, sir...	You oughta be tired, too, Sounder. That possum shore whipped the hell outta you tonight!

1 What's wrong with your leg, Daddy?	Got it hurt in a dynamite blast, son. The dirty dogs had no more use for me, so they let me have time off my sentence, and let me come home.

1 Wheeew! This is some hard work, but it beats goin' to jail.	You won't be goin' to jail again, will you, Daddy?
2 No, son -- they'd have to kill me before I'd let 'em do that to me again!

1 Miss Boatwright --	Yes, David...
2 Will you help me to find out what camp they sent my father to?

1 Who's winning, Mama?	Nobody yet -- it's all tied up.

1 Can't sleep?	No, ma'am...  Mama, I wanted Mrs. Boatwright to find out where Daddy is, so me and Sounder can go see him.
2 So did I. I figured when the time got right, we could all take a day or two and walk up there, but it's not the kind of long trip for a child to take alone.	I can do it, Mama -- you know that. In the Bible stories you read to us, everybody's always goin' on a long journey. Jacob goes into a strange land where his uncle is and he don't even know where he lives, but he finds him. Everybody finds what they supposed to find.
3 But you'll be away from home for days -- what will you do when the dark comes, where will you sleep? I can't send you away from here like that!	Mama, don't I always do what you say -- every time I go to the fields to plant the corn, to Miss Boatwright's and the woods -- you tell me what to do and I do it, and you don't worry.
4 No, I don't and I oughtn't not to after the way you've taken over since they took him away -- and I would like for you to see 'im so you can come back and tell me about 'im.  The field's all planted, so I guess I can spare you for a little while. When do you wanta leave?

1 We brought your laundry, Miss Boatwright.	Come in, children.

1 Hi ya doin' there, Ike?	Any time it's Saturday and I don't hafta do any work, I'm doin' okay!
2 Whatcha got there?	Seems this piece of mail came to Mr. Howard's place this mornin' and he had me to bring it over here.
3 Well, let me have it.	Don't belong to you! It's for the little important man, here!

1 The boy done went into my walnuts! I skin my fingers to the bone to pick two pounds that's worth almost nothing at the commissary and he done took almost half of what I pick!	The boy is hungry, Rebecca.

1 Where you goin'!?	To the commissary to get this boy some clothes! I'm gon' get everybody somethin'!
2 But, Nathan--	Don't tell me nothin' 'bout what we owe ol' man Howard! I'll do the owing, and let him worry 'bout the collecting! Come on, David Lee!

1 Eric! Did you just say the "F" word?	Fragile?

1 Is it Cartman's mom?	Very funny!

1 Dude, that movie was fucking sweet!	You bet your fucking ass it was!

1 Hey Cartman.	What?
2 You know, me and Stan were just talking about what a fat fucking hunk o' fat fuck you are.	Oh yeah?!  Well you're a monkey-shit-

1 Mph rmph rm!!	No you can't Kenny!
2 Mph rm rmph!!	Okay Kenny, I'll bet you a HUNDRED DOLLARS you can't light a fart on fire!
3 Mph mm!

1 You've got a stupid accent too.	Eric, that is not appropriate.
2 What? Fuck French people. Fuck 'em in the ear.	Mkay, you see, children. This is exactly what I'm talking about. We have to change the way you think.

1 Ha! Is the Pope Catholic?	I don't know.
2 Children, I know ALL there is to know about women.

1 WE'RE going! WE started La Resistance to save Terrance and Phillip! We're going!	This will be very dangerous... Are you quite sure?

1 Mph mph.	Then move out of the way.

1 YOU GOTTA BE FUCKING KIDDING ME!!	KYLE BROVLOFSKI, YOU WATCH YOUR LANGUAGE!!

1 No! That's not Terrance or Phillip!	Oh... Alright, back you go.

1 OH MY GOD!! YOU KILLED KENNY!!	YOU BASTARD!!

1 I'm so sick of these soldiers.	Yeah, they suck.

1 WHAT?	Are you sure, Kenny?

1 My fellow Americans. I have led this fight in the War against profanity. I have founded Mothers Against Canada.  Our neighbor to the north has abused us for the last time.	As Commander in chief, I have ordered our Army to set up defensive positions along the US-Canada border in anticipation of an attack.
2 What about air strikes?	Huh?
3 We have to have air strikes on their military and entertainment centers.  It's the only way to ensure that their smut can't reach American soil!	Oh, uh...  I don't know if air strikes are necessary.
4 Not necessary?!  Mr. President, may I remind you that our country's heart and soul are at stake, and our children's minds are the battlefield! The bastard Canadians want to fight us because we won't tolerate their potty mouths. Well, if it is war they want... THEN WAR THEY SHALL HAVE!!!

1 Uh, we're just, starting our program...	This is NOT a place for fun and games! This is rehabilitation! Now GET TO IT!! We at MAC have a trial to go to!

1 Hello, Conan!	Hello, Brooke Shields!

1 AGH!	Terrance! NO!

1 You know I do.	I know.
2 So what do you say we shut off that light and get close, huh?

1 Now do what I say and keep your fucking mouth shut!	THAT'S IT!  I HAVE HAD ENOUGH!!!!

1 Wendy... How would you like to go get some ice cream?	Sure, Stan! How did you know I loved ice cream?
2 My friend the clitoris told me.	Wow, I have a clitoris too.
3 Really? Where the hell do you keep it? It's huge.

1 Oh Warren...oh Warren...take me, God take me...	Oh yeah...
2 Oh yeah...	Oh Sara...
3 Anna...	Anna...

1 Were you going to give it to them?	I am here to provide service to... to all our guests.  There is a high level of passenger dissatisfaction. It is my duty...to report this.
2 Well you did the right thing Mac.

1 You're certain of that?	Trust me.  Even checked 'em with my own eyes.
2 All right, I'll give it a shot.

1 The bridge is fine, Taylor, how are things down there?	Transmit the code 3 emergency and take us offline.  Override the airlock sensors and hurry!  We're running out of time, we have to get to the pods!
2 Much as I'd like to help you and our valued guests, I'm afraid I can't.	What are you talking about! Can you transmit the code 3 -
3 Yes I can transmit the code 3 emergency!  I just don't think it's a prudent move at this juncture.

1 Well that's your call.  Doesn't make a damn bit of difference to me.  Just as long as I get my cut.	Oh you'll get it, believe me.  So I'll see you in a few.
2 10-4 good buddy.

1 What's the use...we're gonna die...	Don't say that!  It ain't over till it's over!

1 Supposing we could get out of this room?  Is there anything we could do to reach the bridge?	It depends on the condition of the ship.  If I could get to one of the suit compartments I could check the exterior air locks for a possible entry.
2 Can't we access the mainframe to check the ship's condition?	With what?  How am I going to interface with it?  I need to be able to talk to the system and to have the system talk to me.

1 I don't know what we're facing.	I understand.

1 I guess I owe you a debt of gratitude.  You saved my life.	It was no time to lose my partner. We're going to have to hurry, he's on to us.

1 He's out of the equation.  Talk to me.	I'm about to blow the wall.
2 Hurry.  You have to get them out of there!	How does the distress signal look?

1 I'm fine.	Congratulations on your...recent award.
2 Thank you.	Is there anything I can help you with?
3 No, just enjoying the view.	Well, there's no better to way to see the world, than with us.
4 So I've been told.	Well if you need anything, please feel free to ask me.  Just a reminder we have fabulous cuisine available 24 hours in the earthrise room, and a large selection of vintage wines here in our ship bar.

1 Look.  We're talking about life and death here.  I don't know why we're even having this conversation.	Well what would you know about it? You don't have anything to lose.

1 But the corridor outside this door is open, correct?	Yes.  You can enjoy some wonderful views from there.

1 Where can I find Buzz Fazeli?	Whoa, cool your maples. Over the bridge, past the Peter Pan, last house on the dead end. Theo releases Sid's hand. Sid drops to his knees and cradles his damaged hand.
2 Haven't seen a ball like that since '69.	It belonged to my dad.

1 Three whips. To go.	When you get a chance.

1 Did you know you were parked in the handicap space?	Kastle's daughter's been lookin' for you.

1 I got suspended when I was young, too. I was pretty cocky in my day.	They suspended me for 100 years.
2 100 years! 	I can appeal in five. I was hoping you could help me Mr. Fazeli.
3 What do you think I can do?	I need a sponsor to get my sanction card back. Where I come from, you're the king.
4 Sure, around here, any fat old bald guy could be king. I'm nothing. It wouldn't do any good for me to talk to the Congress.  Hey, you thirsty? You like orange whips?	I've never had orange whips, I'm from Akron.

1 It's the next level, the next dimension...  ...the small ball.	The small ball.
2 It's gonna be bigger than big. Think Europe. Think Asia. They don't have room for real golf courses in Japan.	Not for me. Miniature golf's for pansies.
3 If the Japanese are pansies, then pansies are my kind of people. Sheila steps over to the booth with their food. The Buzz Burger has three holes cut in the middle to make it look like a bowling ball. Buzz sees the two sleazeballs park their car and walk towards the diner.	Maybe I could bowl in Japan.

1 Oh sure. Let everyone in. From now on I leave the door wide open. Let the parade begin!	Clam it!

1 It's not so bad. When I'm alone, it feels like someone else. Sheila grabs the bottle from Junior, opens it and pours some on her shish kebab. She leans over and whispers furiously to her father.	Do you have to get your hooks into every guy I'm interested in?

1 That's some pinfall. Almost a 133 average. Her ball's flat, she needs to work on her spin control.	That's right, didn't you have a slight control problem in a recent tournament,champ?  Now go take out your "big four", darling.  Come on, we're making her nervous.

1 Don't go near the bowling alley.	Bowling "Center"!

1 Do those two work for your dad or mine?	Mine, and they never tip.

1 Do you talk with your mom?	It's been awhile. She didn't want me looking for my dad.
2 My mom told me not to stay in this town.	So why do you stay?
3 I'm a credit card junkie. I went on a binge and my dad bailed me out. Now I'm trapped in his easy payment plan.	I bet you get to meet a lot of eligible bowlers.
4 Yeah, but they're all little wannabes. I'm looking for a professional man.	I may not be a pro bowler, but I'm no amateur man. Sheila moves closer to Theo.
5 How much would you charge me for the lips?	More than you could afford.
6 Come on, bargain with me.	I could let them go for ten.
7 You professional men drive a hard bargain. I'm afraid I only have five on me. Sheila pulls out a 5 dollar bill.	If you want a professional man, you have to be willing to pay for him.

1 Why did you come back?	When I'm with you Sheila, I don't even think about bowling. Theo takes Sheila in his arms and kisses her passionately. She stops him and looks around nervously.
2 If Junior finds us, he'll kill us both.	I killed him once, I'll just have to kill him again.
3 You don't get two chances with Junior.	At least I'll die smiling.

1 You should probably hit the road. Go home. This place could get hazardous for your health.	So, Buzz was stooling for you guys.
2 You call it stooling, we call it cooperating. Breeze looks under Theo's car.

1 There's heat coming the door.	Back away then.
2 Wait a minute --	I said back away.
3 Would you wait a minute?

1 I'm not sure.  I've never seen anything like it.	You're a fucking biochemist, aren't you?  Can't you tell us something.

1 Norman, please!  Don't!	Pull it, damn it!

1 See this?  Coral.  Geologists measured the coral growth on top of the craft to be over five meters thick.	Geologists?
2 Coral grows at a rate of two and a half centimeters a year --	-- Wait a second --
3 -- dating the crash at least that old.	Hold on --
4 Maybe older --	-- there's got to be some mistake here -- a four hundred year old military spacecraft?  There's no such thing... our space program isn't even forty years old.
5 Extraordinary, isn't it?	It's impossible.
6 I'm afraid it is Dr. Johnson... because it's sitting on the bottom of our ocean floor.

1 You can't just leave Harry down here, sir.	I told you people, nobody goes anywhere unless I say.
2 But sir --	No "buts".  If he wants to be left, we'll leave him.  Hello?  Yes, the subs -- I want a report...  Hello...  Yes, a report. Gimme... shit.

1 Yes, sir.  I'm here.	You see the lever on the green box? Upper right hand corner?

1 Yes, sir.	Well, where the fuck is he?
2 In the ship, sir.

1 So?  What's the problem?	It's nonsense.  There's enough difference between our own species to prove that.

1 Edmunds?  Get in here.  I want to know exactly how this is being transmitted.	She's not gonna know.
2 She wired this system.	If the technology of that sphere is advanced enough -- the way it functions is gonna appear to us like magic.

1 Time travel.  I always thought it was one of those myths... like Santa's reindeer.	What would we be working on in the future that would make us want to come back?
2 Maybe we didn't want to come back.

1 Edmunds?	Don't make stuff up, these emotional theories, just so you can feel important here.

1 It could breathe in air and exhale cyanide gas.	Disrupt our brain waves, interfere with our ability to think.

1 Beth --	You did, didn't you?
2 Don't do this.	You bastard.
3 Beth, I didn't.  Hold it together. Alright?

1 You get it straightened out?	I think so, Beth.  Yes.

1 It's for motion sickness.	Valdomet.
2 Ulcers.	Sintag.
3 A synthetic opium analogue.	Does it cause drowsiness?  That's all we need.  To get him unconscious -- put him under.
4 Nothing about drowsiness.	Tarazine?
5 Tranquilizer.  Causes drowsiness.	Bingo.
6 "... and may also cause bizarre halucinations".

1 It's getting cold.	You think I'd really drink that?
2 You don't think I put something in it, do you?	You put explosives around the habitat, I can't imagine what you'd put in a drink.
3 I did do that, didn't I?

1 Beth, stop it!	Stop what?  Don't blame me.  It's not me.

1 Well, what's your theory?	I'm a woman.  I don't theorize.  I only deal with facts.

1 Just in time, too.	In time for what?
2 What?	Just in time for what?

1 Our answer.	To what?
2 Time travel.  A black hole.

1 Harry, can you tell me about the sphere?	What are you still doing here?
2 You remember opening the door?	You were all supposed to leave.  You weren't supposed to stay down here.
3 Tell me about the door.  Do you remember how you opened the door to the sphere?... Harry?	You don't understand about the sphere.
4 Then explain it to me.

1 It's the squid!  Stop it!	Stop what?  What are you -- ?

1 C'mon, Norman!	I'm trying to keep balance with --
2 Gimme a second --	Just pull her -- down like inside -- Harry, work with me here!
3 Her legs are in the way.	You got her?

1 Easy Ted, we're not mining gold.	Gimme some room here, will you?  Back off.  Gimme some space.

1 Well, if it's a discharge --	It's not a discharge.  Right, Edmunds?  You said before, right?  So it's gotta be a message.

1 No other equipment?  Scientific instruments?	No, they didn't say --
2 This way, sir.

1 Well, how about we wait and see what Harry comes up with?	Sure, why not.  Give him the trophy. That pretentious son of a bitch.  You heard him, Norman.  All that "someone went to a lot of trouble, try again" bullshit.  And "impotent".  Where does he get off saying I'm impotent?  He's a fucking self-righteous, little prick.

1 Well, we'll see...	You might get your stuff together. We'll be coming up on Organa Major soon.

1 Darth Vader is on this system.  I can feel him.  I can feel the Kiber Crystal.	Is that good or bad?
2 It's not good... unless I could find the Crystal.  Then it could be very good.

1 I... I'm not a Bendu Officer.  I'm not even a startrooper.	I know that.
2 You saw through me?	You could put it that way.
3 I assure you my intentions weren't bad.	I know your intentions.  I probably know much more about you than you realize.  In many ways you're a lot like your father.  He was an indulgent man, but a clever warrior.  Now what brings you out here?
4 My father told me many stories about you.  He said if I was ever in trouble, to come here... I need your help.

1 Are you sure you don't need it?	I rarely use it any more.  I have the Force.  The Force is more powerful than any pistol.  You shouldn't put too much faith in that weapon.  Work on becoming aware of the Force... learn to feel its presence within you.  Try to sense what it's telling you.  It's the only thing you can rely on.
2 What do I do?	All you have to do is lose your thinking self.  Don't focus on anything.  Let your body do your thinking... You have to learn to act on what you feel, not what you think ... If I had the crystal, it would be much easier.  You could feel the Force immediately... but for now, let yourself go.  You'll pick it up... and someday you'll have no need for that pistol either.

1 You're Starkiller?	Yes, sir.
2 Have you been checked out?	Yes, sir.  I was considered one of the best bush pilots on Sullust. I've also had six hours on the T-2.

1 All the data banks in Artoo are still secure.	Then I think we're due the reward you offered... and it had better be substantial after what we've been through.
2 When Artoo has been safely delivered to my forces, you get your reward. You have my guarantee.	What's that little 'droid' carrying that's so blasted important?
3 The plans and specifications to a battle station with enough fire power to destroy an entire system... Our only hope in destroying it is to find its weakness, which we will determine from the data I stored in Artoo.	We captured the plans in a raid on the Imperial shipyards, but we fell under attack before I could get the data to safety, so I hid it in this Artoo unit and sent him off.
4 Where are you taking us now anyway?	The fourth moon of Yavin.  I've given the coordinates to Chewbacca.
5 I'd better go see how he's doing.

1 Maybe you should just drop us off. I'm sure we can find someone willing to take the risk.	All right, all right! You've got a ship!  But where do we go from here?  They probably took her to find the hidden bases... I don't see how we can find the rebels before she breaks.  The Empire has already beat us out.

1 Get to the ship!	Come back here... Where are you going?

1 Are there medical facilities on Yavin?	He'll be well cared for.

1 Level five, Detention block A-23, cell 2187.  She's still alive...	Send feed-back into the control sensors in that Detention block.

1 I say we all go to the laser parlor and get cut together.	What do I want with a scar ?

1 Saddle up, Roughnecks !	You heard the Lieutenant ! On the bounce, troopers !

1 Ten of clubs. You still gonna sign up for Starside R&D ?	Passport to the Universe. Who wouldn't want that ?
2 I've been thinking about applying for Federal Service, too. Fleet, maybe.	Your father will never let you.
3 I'm eighteen. It's my decision, I think I'd make a pretty good pilot. I've good great reflexes. You need that for maneuvering, you know.	Only 1 in 14 male applicants make it through stellar navigation. So what do you think your chances are ?
4 Eight point... no, uh, seven...	If you can't do those numbers, you haven't got a chance.
5 All I know is Carmen's going to be a citizen, and I don't think it'll work out for us if I'm not.	Love... how excruciatingly pathetic. Now try and pay attention.

1 Johnny, this is Zander.	Yeah, we know each other from the game. No hard feeling, eh, chum ?

1 WHERE IS IT ?	THERE ! GRAVITY FIELD... IT'S BIG !
2 It looks like an... asteroid.

1 I thought I was dead. Lucky for me you jokers showed up, eh ?	It wasn't luck. Rico ignored the mission objective to rescue you...
2 Is it true ?

1 Romance is just a vestigial biological response to procreation...	Aw, you're in love with me... You just dont know it yet.

1 Hey, Carl, what's wrong ?	Did you get Starside R&D ?

1 What happened to your hair ?	What do you think ? Everyone did it when we got our wings. You don't like it, do you ?
2 It's alright, I guess. You hear from anyone made it out of B.A. alive ?

1 Which way ?	Up. We gotta be near A Company by now.

1 Where'd it come from ?	Trajectory indicates it came out of the Arachnid Quarantine Zone.
2 Number 4, contact Fleet and tell 'em there's a loose asteroid headed their way.

1 It stinks, you goin.	I don't stay where I'm not wanted.
2 If they didn't want you, they woulda kicked you out, amigo.	Hey, they humiliated me in front of everyone ! I'm just supposed to take it, huh ? Well, I'm not gonna, and I guess that proves I just can't cut it.

1 Good good, then it's all settled.	A year at Harvard and you'll  see this "Federal Service" is just menial training for inferior people so they can call themselves "citizens" and take airs for the rest of their lives.

1 You'll resign, and that's all there is to it. It might look bad, but if that's the worst you suffer...	I won't quit !
2 I'm telling you, you will ! You're not going back. You're going to go on vacation !	I'm not going on vacation ! I want to be acitizen ! It's my decision. I made it.

1 You knew the Lieutenant before the war... What was he like ?	He was a teacher , kind of a know it all... Always had this little smile.
2 Geez, I don't think I've ever seen him smile.	Must fill your bottle up real quick when your wife and kids get smeared.

1 Hello... Oh, Johnny...!	Hi, mom.
2 Bill... pick up... it's Johnny ! You little rat. You haven't called, you haven't written. It's been so lonely here without you...

1 What do you think you're doing ?	I'm gonna save Carmen.
2 That would mean a comlete disregard for the mission objective. They hang you for that, Rico.	Yeah, that's right.

1 All dead except one, sir.	Kill the bitch.
2 Yes, sir.

1 This is my farm. Get on the boat, NOW ! That's an order, Sergeant.	Give'em hell, sir !

1 Then V'ger must withdraw its orbiting devices.	V'ger will comply if the carbon units disclose the information.

1 And when V'ger melds? What will happen to you?	It will... take me from <U>you</U>...

1 We'll have to replace Commander Sonak. I'd still like a Vulcan there, if possible...	None available, Captain. There's no one in fact, who's fully rated on this design.
2 You are, Mister Decker. I'm afraid you'll have to double as Science Officer.

1 That's precisely the point, Captain. We don't know it will do. Moving into the cloud -- at this time, is an unwarranted gamble.	How do you define <U>unwarranted</U>, <U>mister</U>?!
2 You asked my opinion, sir.

1 We could have cut it off at the main computer...	This served the purpose.

1 Negative control from inertial lag will continue 22 point five seconds before forward velocity slows to sub-light speed.	Unidentified small object has been pulled into the wormhole with us, Captain! Directly ahead...!

1 Thirty seconds to Cloud boundary...	Opinion, Mister. Spock?

1 Hold station...!	Thrusters at station keeping...

1 I still contain fragments of my human half.	And whatever you sensed out here....
2 ... is my only hope of accomplishing what the Masters could not.

1 That vessel is generating a forcefield measurably greater than the radiation of the Earth's sun.	Transmit image of the Alien to Starfleet; advise we are attempting further communication.

1 Were you right? Spock? V'ger is a living machine...?	A life form of its own; a conscious, living entity.

1 Spock, we <U>were</U> its answer!	Yes, Captain. It needed our mortality, the fear of it, our struggle against it, our fears, our dreams...
2 ... and the 'foolish' emotions which drive us?	I prefer your poet Dante's phrase -- 'the divine restlessness of the human spirit.'

1 Starfleet has been apprised of our situation, Captain.	Tractor beam remains constant...

1 I quit.	You quit.
2 I quit the movie.	Why did you quit?
3 Actually, I'm not sure if I quit.  I think that I got fired.  I'm such a liar. I never could tell the truth.	Don't be so hard on yourself.
4 I just got kicked off my first movie.	Well.  Everybody has reversals.  If you were never down how would you know when you were up?
5 That's good.  That's really good.  You have a gift for words.	It's in your play.

1 I don't mean to impose, but...do you think we might...	That's what the swing is <u>there</u> for...

1 What happened?	Cast stood me up.
2 Uh huh.	They're all preparing for the auditions - your movie.

1 Start?  This isn't a good time.	Oh.  That's alright.  Then I'll come back at a better time.  What would be a better time?
2 Later on.	Then I'll come back, then.
3 You, um, you, um, you going out with your fiance?	No, I just broke up with him.  I'll see you tomorrow.

1 I didn't say anything special, I was just talking out loud.	...how <u>else</u> can you talk?
2 No, that's true.	No.  You, I told them, you can't betray with the picture what you're saying with the words.  And, I don't know, the movies, I don't know.  They should be socially uplifting, why does she have to show her br...what is this...?

1 What is it all about?	I saw...

1 Waal, <u>there</u> you are, and Have I Got Some News for <u>You</u>...	Doug, this is Joe White, and this is, this, this is my fiance, Doug Mac...

1 Well, where do they hold court?	Hold court, they have to, science lab, the high school.

1 A jacket for five dollars...I can buy this town for fifty bucks.	You told me that about the <u>last</u> town.
2 Yeah, but they never made a movie here.	I'm bleeding, Bill, I'm <u>bleeding</u>...
3 ...why am I here...?	What, what, what, what do they got that can pass for the Old Mill...

1 Stay ready.  Stay by yourself in your room.	What'll I do for fun?
2 Whyn't you learn your lines?	I <u>know</u> my lines...

1 Her...	I swear that that woman in my room...

1 Is Mr. Barrenger there...?	No, wait a, wait a, wait a...we can't put her in the car, she gets it in her head to sue, or rape, or some goddam, she wasn't in...

1 It's a mistake.  It's all over.  I'm sorry that we've inconvenienced you.	I wasn't in the car.
2 We know that you weren't.

1 Claire, when did you...	I just...
2 Claire, Bob Bar...

1 I know, it's the hardest thing in the world, and it seems everybody wants...	...yes...
2 ...wants a piece...	Yes.
3 And you know what...?	We, we have to give it.
4 ...and my heart goes out to you, because I know...

1 Where you off to?	I, uh...I'm leaving.
2 Why?	I perjured myself.  I told a lie, and I ruined my life. That's what I did...  I don't suppose you could help me with <u>that</u>, could you?  Turn back the <u>clock</u>, or something?  Give me back my, give me back my <u>purity</u>, I don't suppose you could just wave your magic wand and do that, could you...?  But what <u>is</u> truth? Eh?  In't that the thing?  What <u>is</u> true?
3 It's the truth that you should never trust anybody, wears a bowtie.  Cravat's sposed to point down to accentuate the <u>genitals</u>, why'd you wanna trust somebody, s'tie points out to accentuate his <u>ears</u>...?

1 What's in the case?	Eight hundred thousand dollars in cash.

1 I...	Get Mitch Cohn on the phone in New York, tell him she's breaking her contract and we're very up...
2 I...	We're very upset with her.  Get someone to <u>double for her</u>, her tits, the tits scene, call L.A.  I want to see some <u>pictures</u> of the women's <u>tits</u>.  Of their <u>tits</u>.
3 I'm very sorry I...	You're very sorry, you passive aggressive, son-of-a-bitch...can we replace him?

1 What's the...	Where have you been...?

1 Well, you call him, and call me back, but this is it, pal, you <u>fuck</u> with me, and I'm going to tear out your heart and piss on your lungs through the hole in your <u>chest</u>.   And the best to Marion...  Where have <u>you</u> been?	I...
2 He says they're looking for you all day, you're on <u>salary</u>, he needs <u>pages</u>, what are you, you been 'haying?'  Now:

1 It's just a formality.	That's why I <u>want</u> it.  Type it up and get it back to me in...

1 The chairs go, the Lazyboy goes...	...not the Lazyboy...

1 He's going to <u>get</u> that calf.	Mmm...

1 &quot;Those who travel far and near this will make you DISAPPEAR!&quot;	I have to work on my video project! Don't follow me!  I can put myself to bed.

1 It just slipped out.	It happens.
2 What happens when he loves Rachel more than us?	That will never happen.
3 Never say never you always say that. I'll bet daddy's mad at me now.

1 Look she's upset --	No I'm not.  I don't care.  Why should I care?  I mean nobody asked me when you got divorced.  Nobody asked me if I wanted a new mother.  Nobody even asked me if I like her.  If you guys don't care about our family staying together, why sh...
2 Daddy and I tried hard.  We really did.

1 I can't hear you.	THEN TURN OFF THE CARTOON!

1 Annabelle...wake up honey...	Mom?  What's wrong?
2 Nothing sweetheart.

1 I'm sorry, okay?  Let's not fi...	Don't touch me!  I'm <u>allergic</u> to you!

1 You know what that creep and his frogfaced footmen are calling me <u>now</u>?  In front of the whole <u>world</u>? Frosty, the Snow Bitch!!	That's so weak.
2 Here's <u>weak</u>...Mom said she was gonna talk to the <u>teacher</u> and Brad's <u>parents</u>!!  Can you <u>believe</u> the <u>humiliation</u>???	Honey, she won't d...

1 Now Ladies, the secrets to a great pie is the crust.  And the secret to a great flaky pie crust comes from less flour and more...what?	Ice cold water.
2 That's my girl...

1 But you told us to starve.	Hello?...Duncan...The Ad Agency's already there?...I'm out the door...  Ben!  Knock it off!  It's gonna go beautifully...  Damn it Ben --

1 IS THAT YOU?	IT'S YOUR GIRLFRIEND, BIG GUY, OPEN UP.

1 I'm somewhere, thinking of you.  And meatballs.  And you know what?	Yes.
2 Of course, you do.  Being magic. Then you know I've got a flu bug, and I turn green and barf profusely when I even think about food.  So, all the more meatballs for you.  But you know what.	I did.  Do I have to eat lamb? Daddy didn't cook it, she did.
3 Do me a favor?  Eat it, and then give me a secret report, okay?  Pay particular attention to whether it's chewy and if it tastes more like chocolate or soup.

1 Ben!  Mommy's so glad to see you -- Now stop climbing!  Ben listen to me...	No!  I have to get there.
2 Where Ben?	Before you.
3 Ben where do you have to get to?	Heaven.  I have to tell him he's made a mistake.  He should take Grammy Martha first.  Or Grandpa Norman.

1 Cooper, back the fill off I don't have enough shadow...	You've got a fruit loop in your hair.
2 You say that like I don't know that.	I once threw an entire bowl of jello on my stepmother's head --
3 And when did that pass?	Actually, never.  They'll always hate you.  There's a gene for it.

1 Which part of no don't you understand?	Look, I will <u>send</u> a P.A. to pick up the children.  There are <u>agencies</u> that supply sitters, nannies...
2 They're losing one mother.  They can't lose two.

1 Our children.	Do you realize what could have hap- pened to your son today?  How lucky we are the police found him before some lunatic did?  He could have been...
2 But he hasn't.  He wandered off.  I know it's terrifying.  I can imagine how you felt when that call came -- But it happens.	Not to me.
3 Jackie, you've made mistakes -- We all make mistakes --	I'm not gonna wait around to see the next one.  I'm not gonna watch my kids fall through the cracks of this arrangement.  I'm seeing a lawyer.
4 Jackie stop.  We promised we never go there.	We've broken a lot of promises, haven't we Luke?

1 The great thing about life is that things keep changing.	Remember when Mommy and Daddy got divorced?
2 And we all went through that together?

1 Luke was in the shower this morning and Annabelle sort of walked in without knocking.	I'm sure that didn't upset her. Everyone in our family takes showers.
2 I was in there in him.

1 So why did y...	I did it for her.

1 Uh.  Have you told Luke and the ki...	Let's...hold up for a bit.  It may not happen.  Our secret, okay?

1 And cigarettes.  I smoke, too.	You are <u>marrying</u> the <u>greatest</u> guy who walks this <u>earth</u>.  Who I have <u>loved</u> from my <u>heart</u> for twelve<u>years</u>!

1 Can I look at the pictures?	It's a mess, right now.  That's my project when I get back.

1 I'm thinking.  Do I know you well enough to really chew you out?	No.

1 Now, 'limp dick', I know.  What. Is 'snowballing'?	It doesn't matter, I didn't tell h...
2 Because there'll be, oh, 20 or 30 mothers phoning me in the next hour or so.  And they'll b...	Give 'em my number.

1 She likes a Stolie, no ice.	Double.

1 You know, there's nothing you have to say.  Because they know your heart.  You don't have t...	Just sit me up.  Nice and tall. Bring Benjamin first.

1 It's forever you know.	Okay...Is that the good thing or the bad thing?
2 Because I can't hurt anyone like this ever again.

1 She called it a fight.  <u>The</u> fight.	What do you call it?  You told her you had doubts.

1 Out! Leave the table!	What?
2 You heard me: leave the table!	Man, I am out of here! This family is so fucked!

1 When I'm in high school I'm not going to play any football. I'm just going to concentrate on class rank.  What did you do in high school?	I did not go to high school.
2 Weren't there high schools in El Salvador?	We had to work. My family was poor.
3 Must've been hard being poor.	I'm still poor.
4 Hmmm.  But, Consuelo, even though your poor, don't you have any hobbies or interests or anything?	No, Mikey.
5 But like, what do you like to do when you're not working?	I'm always working.
6 But when you're not. Like now. What do you like to do?	This is work.
7 But it's not like real work. This is just babysitting.

1 Steak's really good tonight. SCOOBY  Good.	Got a lot of homework?

1 Hi, Scooby! How was school today?	Fine.
2 Ready for tomorrow?	What's tomorrow?
3 The SATs, knucklehead. SCOOBY I'm not taking them.

1 But what kind of pull did you have?	I have a cousin. Very big giver to the alumni fund.

1 I just want to know what the hell he's doing in his room that's so interesting he doesn't come down for dinner.	Maybe he's building a bomb...just like-!

1 You have beautiful skin.	Thank you.  So Catherine seems like she might become a really good writer.
2 Maybe. She's OK.

1 That's good.	Yeah...um...so anyway, tell me. What about you? I'd heard through the grapevine you were producing movies.
2 Yeah. But not any more.	Oh. Tired of 'life in the fast lane'?

1 What is most important to you?	I dunno. I'd like to be good at something. It doesn't have to be TV. I mean, it could be movies...Anything. I'd be willing to direct.

1 Anything else?  Maybe a sandwich?	Just the soda, please. Cooper heads down the hall.  Filmore watches him leave, sighs, then turns and smiles at the General manager:

1 You're a lot like my father, Cooper... you think with your heart.	Used to Filmore, used to.

1 Go fuck yourself...	Hey now!  No cussing on TV!  Well in closing I'd like to say that there are two reasons to have that money outside in an hour.  One is my perky co-anchor here, and the second is the lives of tens of thousands of people--people just like you and me!

1 What about Cooper--where is he?	He's in there...

1 Have you broken it yet?  We've got six more heads and that means six more hours.	I'm in to the directory but they've codified the stockpile--numerically.

1 Of the separate chemicals--I don't know, uh, offhand--	How much of this shit do they have, White!!
2 They must have got their hands on a test vial!	What does that mean?
3 There's enough in one vial...

1 Yes?	Allow me to assure you that my government will not be satisfied with a polite note of regret for this shocking example of aggression against our peace-loving people.

1 My seven body orifices????	That's right, fella.
2 One, two...  three, four...  five...  Why you, dirty, stinking...

1 Go back to sleep, baby.	What did you say, sir?

1 Under the circumstances, General, what would you think they should do?	Well...I suppose penetrate the base by force.
2 You see, you knew the answer all the time, General.	But that would mean some of our own boys will get hurt, Mister President.
3 What do you suppose is going to happen if General Ripper's planes start bombing their targets?	That certainly would be a problem, sir.

1 Suppose that were the case?	But -- why...that would be an awful thing to do, sir.
2 Perhaps, Major.  Perhaps.  Pour me a scotch and soda, please.  And help yourself to whatever you like.

1 Major, those are my boys out there dying.	Yes, sir.  Why don't you stop the fighting, sir?

1 I believe it will be just a few minutes, at the most.	How many planes did we lose?
2 I'm not certain, Mister President.  But I believe it was four.	General Faceman, what was the name of the officer who called me from Burpelson?

1 We should be crossing the coast in about six minutes.	Thanks, Binky.  Can you see Bromdingna Island yet?
2 I don't think so.

1 Just the missiles.	They must have been fired from Bromdingna - probably one of their new Vampire - 202's. They've got a range well over a hundred miles.
2 Forty-five.  Still coming straight and fast. Twelve o' clock.	Speed?
3 Between Mach 3 and 4.	Call them every five miles.
4 Thirty-five, still straight.

1 Wing attack, Plan-R.  That's exactly what it says.	Check your code again.  No one at base would pull a stunt like that, Terry.
2 That's what I'm doing, and it comes out the same.

1 Listen, King, old buddy.  On behalf---	Skip it and jump, damn you!  This flak's so close, I can smell it.

1 Yes, Major.	Lothar, get up here fast, and bring your First- Aid kit!  I'm hit kinda bad, I think.
2 Can't "Ace" help you?	He's dead.
3 What happened?	I bit his jugular vein.  Now will you shut up and get up here???
4 Sure!  Sure, I'm on my way.

1 We crossed the coast over an hour ago. Okay?	You're giving them an awful lot of credit for being on the ball.
2 First lesson in War College:  Never under- estimate your enemy.	Sorry, King.
3 Forget it.  Okay, team, let's break it up and get ready for the kick-off.

1 It would not be difficult.  Nuclear reactors could provide power almost indefinitely. Greenhouses could maintain plant life. Animals could be bred and slaughtered. A quick survey would have to be made of all the suitable minesites in the country, but I shouldn't be surprised if several hundred thousand of our people could be accomodatedd. Every nation would undoubtedly follow suit.	But who would be chosen?
2 A special committee would have to be appointed to study and recommend the criteria to be employed, but off-hand, I should say that in addition to the factors of youth, health, sexual fertility, intelligence, and a cross-section of necessary skills, it would be absolutely vital that our top government and military men be included, to impart the required principles of leadership and tradition.

1 It's called "Burger Manifesto, Part One The Dialectical Expression of Testosterone." Isn't that a great title?	Why is everything about you, Jeff?

1 Your ability to fantasize is only exceeded by your ability to lie.	Oh, untrue, Jeffster. I think, uh, two weeks ago we attended a concert where I had fucked two girls.
2 Hey, it's me. No, that's, that's the ultimate liar of liars.	And your mom.
3 No, I'm here. Where are you?	Where are you-hoo?
4 No, no, no, no, I don't wanna be stuck with the guy. I want the tickets.	Stuck, who? What guy? Huh?
5 Shut up! Aw...

1 You know what we should do? Go to the...	So you can do an album cover?

1 Sure. You make art and you want people to see it.	Wait, what happened to the tree?

1 Your his publicist?	Sure I am. It's fun.
2 Mm. And your like, what else?

1 Look, look, look. You gotta go now, okay? The customers complain.	We're your customers. We're not complaining.
2 Please!

1 No, no, no, no, no, it's new.	Please.
2 I just started it.

1 What's up guys?	Uh, you know, just admiring the scenery, you know?

1 He says we got to be at the radio station at seven a.m. Can you handle that?	Oh, sure.
2 Great.  Hi. I'm Erica.	Oh, Erica, this is my friend Jeff.
3 Hi, Jeff. Nice to meet you.	Jeff, Erica. God, it's so amazing to be back home.
4 Oh, wow.	I mean, we've been playing big places everywhere, but when we did that sound check at The Orpheum, it suddenly hit me. I'm playing The Orpheum, you know? I mean, the last time I played here was, uh, the prom.

1 Two-fifty.	Two-fifty? They go up?
2 Always two-fifty, my friend.

1 I ate a dog when I was in Thailand. Tasted exactly like this sparerib.	No, wait, no, I thought about New York.

1 Tim, can we go? This is ridiculous.	Hey, Ma, look at me! Top of the world, Ma!

1 Was that supposed to be me?	No.
2 Yes.

1 What?	Did it ever occur to you that I might have some feelings about you moving to New York?
2 What feelings?	Us.
3 Of course.	And?
4 Come with me.	No, no, see, that's not what I'm saying. I could go to New York if I wanted to, but what's the point? So I can learn how to order a cappuccino? So I can get mugged by some crackhead? So I can see, see homeless people up close and personal?
5 So what do you wanna do?	Nothing.
6 No one does nothing, Jeff.	Okay, well, then, I'm gonna break new ground.
7 New ground?	Mm-hm.
8 Taking one community college course on the history of Nicaragua, while barely holding a job packing boxes?	Okay, look. My job is not who I am. I don't need that. Why? What's your goal? Status? Money? Getting your picture on the cover of some glossy magazine?
9 My goal is to make art.	So, what, why can't you do that here? What's wrong with here? Why is somewhere else better?
10 Why should I stay here, Jeff? So we can sit on the corner and watch the lights change, while you bitch about Burnfield?	Mm-mm.
11 So I can spend the rest of my life guessing what it would be like to be a real artist?	No, no.
12 So you and I can fuck while your parents are out having dinner at the Sizzler? What are we doing, Jeff? You and me?	I don't know.

1 Do your covers and all that shit.	'Bye, Jeff.
2 Go.	What?
3 Just go.

1 So who are you?	What do you mean?
2 Well, if we're, like, the man invisible, what are you?	I don't know. Uh, I'm an artist, I guess. You know, there's life and then there's the people watching the life, commenting on it.
3 Yeah, well, that's what I do too.	What?
4 Comment, say things, think. Whatever. Why are you so special?	Well, I, I didn't say I was special, but it's one thing, you know, and it's another thing to actually communicate it to people. You know what I mean? If a tree falls in a forest and no one hears it, does that make a sound?
5 Of course it does.

1 Pakistani. Okay? We're from Pakistan.	Alright, alright, enough with the Boy Scout routine.
2 Please. Look...

1 Yeah, come on, play it.	Oh, no, man. I can't.

1 Is that Jeff?	Oh, my god!

1 Okay. You know what? Watch your fucking language, alright? Or I might have to.	Whatever.
2 Oh, come on, Pony. I'm just kidding. Wow, you rock stars are really sensitive, huh? You know, there's a life on the road?	Don't do that, man, okay?

1 Hey, your gonna regret this.	Come on, Jeff.

1 I can't believe your grandparents never come down here.	You have three heart attacks and a half dozen strokes and tell me how much you wanna run up and down the stairs.  Shit - I forgot to pick up the cigarettes.

1 ...He slices off the guy's ear, and I mean you see everything - the bloody pink hole where the --	Cleo, I've already thrown up twice today - could you please get to any relevant part of the movie?
2 Well...uh...they, y'know, uh... They had nicknames.

1 No.	If you don't - can you still afford to go to Harvard?
2 ... I don't know.  Probably not.	So then this isn't crazy.  It's a sure bet.
3 Well...

1 I never knew you dreamed of working in a grocery store bank branch.  Baby, we are living the great American Dream!	Mmm-hmmm...

1 "No" you're not sure or "No" I'm not fat?	Uh, "no"... You're not fat.
2 You sure I'm not fat?

1 Yeah?	Oh thank Buddha it's you, Kim-Lo, I'm being held against my will, my civil rights have been violated and it took four days to make this one phone call...
2 Hello?	Kim-Lo?
3 No.  This is Diane.  I think you have the wrong number.	Ooops, that's me -- gotta run!
4 Wrong number  Nooooooo!

1 Hello?	We're dead!  They showed this prison movie to my youth group on Sunday.
2 Hannah, we've...	It wasn't like the prison we saw - all these women had to shave their heads because they got lice from the filthy lives they'd lived!  Oh G-d, I'm gonna be someone's bald bitch!
3 Ooops, hold on a sec.

1 Oh my G-d!  I'm not first!	But you're not married.

1 Diane, it says here you're going to have mood swings, uncontrollable gas.	More proof God's a guy...
2 ...and sex dreams where you actually have an orgasm!	Virgin Mary musta snuck that one in.

1 Good party.	The greatest.  They call me the Elsa Maxwell of the assistant directors.  Hey, easy on the punch bowl.  Budget only calls for three drinks per extra. Fake the rest.
2 Listen, Artie, can I stick around here for a while?

1 Perhaps the reason I hated Bases Loaded is that I knew your name. I'd always heard you had some talent.	That was last year.  This year I'm trying to earn a living.
2 So you take Plot 27-A, make it glossy, make it slick --

1 Sorry, Miss Schaefer, but I've given up writing on spec.	I tell you this is half sold.
2 As a matter of fact.  I've given up writing altogether.

1 May I say you smell real special.	It must be my new shampoo.
2 That's no shampoo.  It'smore like a pile of freehly laundred hand- kerchiefs, like a brand new auto- mobile.  How old are you anyway?	Twenty-two.
3 That's it -- there's nothing like being twenty-two.  Now may I suggest that if we're ever to finish this story you keep at least two feet away from me ...  Now back to the typewriter.

1 Norma, I want to apologize for not calling you.	You'd better.  I'm very angry.
2 I'm pretty busy, as you can see...	That's no excuse.  You read the script, didn't you?
3 Yes, I did.	Then you could have picked up the phone yourself instead of leaving it to one of your assistants.
4 What assistant?	Don't play innocent.  Somebody named Gordon Cole.
5 Gordon Cole?	And if you hadn't been pretty darned interested in that script, he wouldn't have tried to get me on the phone ten times.
6 Gordon Cole... Look, Norma, I'm in the middle of a rehearsal.  Make yourself comfortable.

1 Are you or aren't you?	I think that's what it says on my driver's license.
2 And you have written pictures, haven't you?	Sure have.  The last one I wrote was about cattle rustlers. Before they were through with it, the whole thing played on a torpedo boat.

1 That's a dreadful shirt you're wearing.	What's wrong with It?
2 Nothing, if you work in a fill- ing station.  And I'm getting rather bored with that sport jacket, and those same baggy pants.  Max, what's a good men's shop in town?  The very best... Well, go there !	I don't need any clothes, and I certainly don't want you buy- ing them for --
3 Why begrudge me a little fun? I just want you to look nice, my stray little boy.

1 What are the notes?	"Mad about the boy."
2 Norma, I can't take it.  You've bought me enough.	Shut up.  I'm rich.  I'm richer than all this new Hollywood trash. I've got a million dollars.
3 Keep it.	I own three blocks downtown. I have oil in Bakersfield -- pumping, pumping, pumping. What's it for but to buy us anything we want.
4 Cut out that us business.

1 How do you like that? We've made twelve pictures together. His greatest successes.	Maybe deMille is shooting.
2 I know that trick! He wants to belittle me.  He's trying to get my price down.  I've waited twenty years for this call.  Now Mr. deMille can wait till I'm good and ready.

1 You heard him.  I'm a star!	Norma, grow up.  You're a woman of fifty.  There's nothing tragic about being fifty - not unless you try to be twenty-five.
2 I'm the greatest star of them all.	Goodbye.  Norma.
3 No one leaves a star.  That makes one a star.

1 Whose room was this?	It was the room of the husband. Or of the husbands, I should say. Madame has been married three times.

1 Relax, fans.  The car isn't here.	Is that So?
2 I lent it to a friend of mine. He took it up to Palm Springs.	Had to get away for his health, I suppose.
3 You don't believe me?  Look in the garage.	Sure we believe you, only now we want you to believe us.  That car better be back here by noon tomorrow, or there's going to be fireworks.
4 You say the cutest things.

1 Bring something to drink.	Yes.  Madame.

1 I said stop, I didn't say run into a brick wall.	What is it?
2 The Coffer of Shadow. Look at it.

1 Yes! You own the Coffer of Shadow. Nothing can withstand its power.	I've been saving it. For the right moment.
2 That moment is now! What good is a sword unless it be unsheathed? Use it, and no one will dare oppose you again. No one.

1 Wait...don't leave me in here...	It's for your own protection.

1 There's one sure way to find out how you feel.	What's that?
2 Let me kiss you.	No.
3 You're not afraid are you?	Of course not, but...there are things we don't understand.
4 If we wait until we understand everything we'll be dead. Come on. You can learn more from one kiss than from years in school.	Well...I guess one is all right.

1 Hey, listen, when all this blows over, maybe we could get together every now and then and see each other. And maybe something might. happen again. What do you think?	Are you asking me for a "date"?
2 Why not? You're a good-looking girl. And I'm--- available.	Aren't you forgetting about Selena?
3 She'll forget about us eventually.

1 Hey! Ethan!	Hmmm?
2 Remember me? We were in a disaster together.

1 This is your problem, right here. This girl's driving you insane, Ethan. Let me help you.	I don't want your help.
2 Come back to my house. My car's outside.

1 Hey, where you going?	I've got things to do.
2 What about my proposal?	Call me next week. Maybe we can have lunch.

1 I had to dump the papers in a trashcan. The Danvers have been arrested!	How do you know?
2 I saw them dragged out of the Administration Building.	Did anybody notice you?
3 I can't help it if men notice me.	Lucy! Be serious. We could be executed for  treason!

1 I'm sorry... I didn't know.	It was my fault. You aren't old enough to use the wand. I shouldn't have given it to you.

1 Why is he acting so strangely?	I dunno, but he's gonna get creamed.

1 Cheer up, Nigel. It's not the end of the world.	It may well be. I know how you won that election Selena. You can't fool me.
2 I have plans Nigel. You could come with me... I'm going places.	You're not going anywhere. Except back to nowheresville. You're too impatient, Selena. Look around you--all these people have served years and years of apprenticeship. Some of their families have been in the Craft for generations. You can't join and take over our whole organization in a few months.

1 Which of you is willing to make that sacrifice?	You would! You revealed our existence so you could have all of our power.
2 Maybe you'd like to get rid of this Supergirl yourself, Nigel?	Why get rid of her at al1? You've used the Coffer of Shadow too much.  It is beginning to rule your heart.
3 Nonsense.

1 They'll be grateful. If you hadn't found it, it would still be lost. Look, up ahead.	Yes, I see it. Shining like a jewel.
2 That's home.

1 There is a way.	I knew it!
2 But it's impossible.	Why?
3 No, it wouldn't work, you couldn't, it's too--- if it didn't work you'd be swept into a singularity--- no, you'd never make it. Forget I mentioned it.

1 What?	First the supplier couldn't find the invoice. Then the order came up short. Then I missed the four o'clock plane from Cleveland and had to rent a car, and then I got a darn flat tire on the highway! Can you beat it? Boy, your boss must've been furious when I didn't show up by the end of the day today, huh?

1 Lana Lang. How great to see you.	Clark.

1 Gee, I haven't done this in years.	Some people don't think it's healthy.
2 Well, it's true you have to be careful things don't spoil, especially with mayonnaise or cream.	Clark, I think you worry too much about mayonnaise.
3 Me??	I'm talking about salt.  Oh, go ahead, pour it on, relax. That's what picnics are for.

1 No, well in this case I think I can speak for him.  I mean, I'm pretty close to him, you know.  Superman will be there on Wednesday.	Well, he's going to get the best home-cooked meal he's had in... in a long time. You tell Superman we think he's wonderful.

1 Mr. Kent, could I ask you something?	Sure.
2 Could you get me Superman's autograph?

1 Ah yes, August Gorman. Have you looked for work this week, Mr. Gorman?	Yeah.
2 What kind?	Kitchen. . . Technician
3 Dishwasher? Any luck?	Nope, but --
4 Mr. Gorman, according to our records you have been unemployed for 36 weeks.	Thirty-five.
5 Not counting this week.  You secured employment last June as a messenger and were discharged after one day for. . .	They said I lost it on the subway, but it ain't the truth! It was a pickpocket took it!
6 A television set?	Well, it was one of them little bitty two-inch screen Japanese jobs.
7 The only other employment you found was in a fast-food joint--  -- which lasted. . . 28 minutes! Well! That's some kind of record. Talk about fast!	Man, them people was crazy! How they 'spect you to learn all that jive on the first day? "Hold the pickle! Hold the lettuce! Extra onions! Special sauce! No special sauce!" Ain't nobody found no meat inside that glop yet.
8 Mr. Gorman, the city of Metropolis is generous to a fault, but. . .	I know, I'm the fault.
9 Thirty-six weeks of chronic unemployment, thirty-six weeks of living off the taxes of hard-working citizens. Do you know what you are?	Don't call me a bum! I ain't no bum!
10 You are, I was about to say, no longer eligible.	What about this week's check?
11 

1 Gus, Webco, the Webster industrial complex, is a family-owned cartel. A little magnesium here, a little zinc there. Some railroads here, some farm machinery there. You follow?	I'm tryin' to.

1 Hey, boss.	Just the man I wanted to see!
2 Turn on the T.V.	I did. isn't it neat-o?
3 Uh...what channel were you watching?	What are you talking about, fella?

1 A waste-basket? GUS Those are plans.  Blueprints.	For what?
2 A computer.	We've already got some.
3 Not like this one you ain't. Nobody in the world got one like this 'cause it don't exist yet. We got to build it.	You designed it?
4 I invented it, man. In my head. It's a stone killer-diller get-down get-it-on and twice-on-Sunday super mutha computer.	What will it do?
5 Everything.	What will it get me?
6 Anything.	Tell me more...

1 Through the telephone line terminal, that ain't nothin'.	Oh Bubba, think of the possibilities.
2 What she call you?

1 You know, I really wasn't expecting all this.	Well...I guess they did get a little carried away.

1 Lots of things...	Tell me.

1 You! Activate circuits 29 through W7 and start Full Power Coordinates on Exterior Defensive Systems:	In other words, push this red button.

1 I don't know who. Whom. I can't trace it.  In the old days it was simple. We kept books, we had ledgers, we could see what was going in and what was paid out. If somebody wanted to rob you, he'd come in with a gun and say 'stick 'em up."  Now they get theses blasted computers to do their dirty work!	My friend, you are yesterday. Whoever pulled this caper is tomorrow.

1 Small potatoes.	We already have a super-tanker.
2 Chicken feed.  If Gus Gorman can push the right buttons ---	I could have it all! Holy cats! All the oil! All the tankers! All the pumps! The gosh-darn world will be out to lunch! No heat, no gas--sis, this is some nifty idea!

1 Yes! This time we got it right!	It's your genius, pal! You built a machine that can find anybody's weak spot, just like you said.

1 It is kinda romantic.	In July???

1 You've been under a lot of pressure lately -	Uh-uh.  Listen, I'll tell you what. You say I'm wrong. And I say I'm right. So why don't we make a little bet on it?
2 How could you win a crazy bet like --

1 Blood . . . my . . . blood . . .	Let's get you inside . . . .

1 I'll try to remember that . . .	Well, you should. Because I appreciate you, too, you know.
2 You do?	Sure. Especially if you'd be a really terrific guy and bring me a cheeseburger to go --

1 This way Lex.	It' s fantastic! ----- This place is genius.
2 Genius!  --  Lex.	I'll be alright.
3 No, me, me, me. Thank you.	It's beautiful.
4 It's beautiful.

1 Don't feel bad, Mr. Luthor. It almost worked. I mean California almost threw up right in the ocean. Millions of people almost killed. If it hadn't been for that guy Superman - that overgrown boyscout...	I want my Liberace record back tonight.
2  DELETE IN CUTTING

1 I never did this before . . . I have to tell you.	Hey, don't worry. You'll be fine, Just . . . well, don't rush it.

1 Put down Lex Luthor !	Put down Lex Luthor?

1 Look, they need a machine to fly.	Brave young heroes. Be nice to them, my dear. Blow them a kiss.

1 Don't tell me. You learned to dance at church socials.	Actually, I had a crash course from my mother the night before my prom.

1 Shouldn't you pay the cabbie?	Oh . . . Right. . . I'll be back in a flash.

1 Oh, probably just a picture request. I'll take care of it if you want, Lois.	I don't think 'fan mail' fits this letter.  Read it, Clark.

1 Impossible? Why?	Because I made a vow. Never to interfere in the destiny of your planet.
2 But what good is a vow if everything gets blown away?  What good was my letter?	I'm going to pass this letter on to all the leaders of the world. I promise you. For it is they , and not I, that represent the people of Earth.

1 No, Daddy. Our business is journalism. We can't continue to be so irresponsible . . . or else we'll just lead everyone into a disaster.	Don't be over-dramatic, young lady. What kind of disaster could we help bring about?

1 Where's Clark?	He was getting on . . . and then this man with luggage and . . .  oh, it's a long story.
2 It always is with Clark.

1 Hey! Just remember I made you.	You're just an experiment, freako!

1 I am an experiment? I am freako?	I made you, and I can destroy you.

1 Superman. . .  But you're... dead!	Still having delusions, Lex Luthor?

1 But Mr. Luthor, sir, I already  --	And stop interrupting. his is the big scene.  Your finest hour! You rose to the challenge, baby! And you lost. That's the best part!

1 Do you know where you're headed?	North. It's north

1 It isn't worth getting a heart attack over, Lois.	You're great with the advice, Clark. Maybe you'd better take over the lovelorn column.
2 Supposing that man had hurt you? Is it worth risking your life over ten dollars, two credit cards, and a lipstick? I mean, it's not as if --

1 Couldn't we forget the plane? You could lift me in your big strong arms?	Sure, and let the plane crash in the middle of the city.
2 Oh.	Look, lady, you saved my life once. I owe you a favor. But I can't understand why you follow a man like that.
3 What can I tell you? He's my leader.	Okay.  Take me to your leader.

1 What's the temperature now?	Fifty degrees below and still falling.
2 When it gets to seventy-five below, stabilize it.

1 About Vesuvius. About Superman writhing in the bowels of the volcano.  Ahh, the look on his face when he saw that Kryptonite. When will I see another, y'know? Y'know?	I don't like to talk about it, Lex.
2 Weak sister.  I still can't figure out why it took so long for you to catch up with us after we all ran out. Y'know?	You ever try to run in high heels?  You probably did.
3 Is that an innuendo, Miss Teschmacher? Because if it is, you are about to experience the heady thrill of being hurled from a moving vehicle.

1 Nothing, nothing. I just want to invite him to tea.	Tea?
2 You got wax in your ears?	What if he doesn't show up? What if he's taking a nap?
3 He always shows up when somebody's in danger.

1 It's a ...baby.	What's your name, boy?
2 Don't just stand there gapin' Jonathan. Can't you see he's cold?

1 Lois, take Kent there and introduce him around	Okay, but...why?  No offense.

1 Can you actually fly faster than the speed of sound?	Sure.
2 Do you like pink?	Very much.
3 Where do you hail from?	Well, I was born on a planet your scientists don't know too much about. It's in the Xeno Galaxy. Or it was. It was called Krypton. That's K-R-Y-P...

1 Well, gents? What did I tell you? It's a piece of cake.	It's a Twinkie, boss.

1 It would never have worked, Luthor. You are a dreamer  --  a sick, twisted dreamer.	Maybe I should get help.
2 It wouldn't hurt. You can't go on living in fantasies. Did you really think you could get hold of a nuclear bomb? And drop it?  Why, our Strategic Defense boys would have  --	You're right, you're right, Superman. There were wrinkles to iron out. But, well...  ...there is this new rocket, the XK 101.
3 The XK 101. Luthor, that operates on radio waves. And with our fail-safe system, only the President himself can push that button.	I know. I know.  I never promised myself a rose garden.

1 So there were others?	Other clinics?  Oh sure.  Clinics, half-way houses, treatment centers, detox units...
2 Then...when did she get better?	She didn't.
3 But you said...	That's where I'm going.  To see her.
4 She's in trouble?	Yes.  Do you find there's something strange about this meat?

1 That's my daughter.  Or it may be the police to tell me that they've found her dead.  She's a drug addict.	Why are you telling me this?
2 I'm telling you this because we've all lost our children, Mr. Ansel...

1 I don't see how that concerns you, Billy.	It does concern me.
2 Well, I don't know why it should. There's a whole lot of people in town involved with lawsuits.  We're hardly unique here, Billy.  I mean, I can understand how you feel.	How?

1 Yes.	It's natural.
2 Your kids never cry.	Well, maybe that's because they know I'm going to follow them.  Behind the bus.
3 They can look forward to that.	Sure.
4 Just like we look forward to this.

1 That's the way I thought of them sometimes.	Berries.
2 Yes.  Like I was putting them into my big basket.  Clearing the hillside of its children.

1 Good morning, Wanda.  Hi, Hartley.	Hi, Dolores.

1 Maybe we shouldn't be talking about this just now, with you barely home. Aren't you hungry, honey?  Want me to fix you something?	No.  What's this lawyer business?

1 You can only feel lucky that you didn't die for so long.  Then you start to feel...unlucky.	That you didn't die?  Like the other children?
2 Yes.  Like Bear and the Ansel twins and Sean and...

1 Do you have a room?	Will you be spending more than a night?
2 Hard to say.  I might have...some business here.

1 I'm in a car wash.	A car wash!  Wow, I've never talked to you when you've been in a car wash.  Make sure you've got the windows closed.
2 Remember that time we were having the car washed and I started playing with the automatic window?  How old was I, Daddy?  Five or six?  I got absolutely soaked, remember?	Why are you calling me, Zoe?
3 Why am I calling you?  You're my father.  I'm not supposed to call you?  What's the matter with wanting to talk to you, Daddy?

1 We do.	Is there shrimp on it?
2 Yes.	If you could pick the shrimp off, as well as anything that touches the shrimp...
3 I'm not sure if that will leave much on the plate.	Well, let's see what we get.

1 Now on that morning, did there come a time, Nicole, when you left your parents' house?	Yes.
2 What time in the morning was this?	About eight-thirty in the morning.
3 Was anyone waiting for the bus with you?

1 You saw the speedometer?	Yes.
2 Did you say anything to Mrs. Driscoll?	No.
3 Why not?	I was scared.  And there wasn't time.
4 There wasn't time?	No.  Because the bus went off the road.  And crashed.
5 You remember this?	Yes.  I do now.  Now that I'm telling it.

1 He's a lawyer.  He's our lawyer.	You and Mom have a lawyer?
2 Well, yes.  He's your lawyer too.	My lawyer?  Why do I need a lawyer?

1 That sonofabitch owes thousands to the bank and half the businesses in town.  He's about to lose his house and car.	But Charlene...
2 Charlene's over at the Spread Eagle every other night.  Sleeps with whatever she can get her hands on. She'll go down for a pat on the head and a fistful of peanuts.

1 Come on boys, break it up...	The next time you want information, Falco, don't scratch for it like a dog - ask for it like a man!

1 Thanks for the publicity spread you got the boys for the benefit tomorrow.	Robard's my client.  I did it for him and his club, not your boys.

1 Well, son, looks like you went out and bought yourself a packet of trouble...	You've been very kind about it, Mr. Hunsecker. HUNSECKER Give Susie credit for that.  I took her word that there was nothing to the smear.  Matter of fact, I'll have my say about smears on the show today.  That's why I'd like YOUR personal assurance, too.
2 Mr. Hunsecker, there's nothing to that smear.  You have my sincere word...	I'll by that, son.  Now, you owe ME a favor.  Be good to my kid sister...

1 Not being partial, are you?	No, I'm not.  I'm not!

1 Susie, I'm sorry if---	Sometimes I think ALL men are fools!...

1 Say, that's good - it's nice - in fact, it's APT, Harry!	Yeah, I got eyes.  I put things together.
2 I remember ONCE when you didn't quite "put things together".  Boy! Was the Mayor mad!

1 Awright, that brings us up to five weeks ago. "Sidney, I got a nasty little problem here." Did I say no? I'm frank to admit - it don't jell as fast as we like... But all of a sudden I CAN'T GET YOU ON THE PHONE NO MORE!  WHY?... And why, as of this date, am I frozen out of the column...	Are you finished?
2 No, lemme finish.  I DON'T LIKE THIS JOB!  That boy is dumb only on matinee days - otherwise he's got a head.  And Susan, like you said, she's growing up.  Two heads. What I mean, we got a slippery, dangerous problem here!	Not "we", Sidney, you!
3 Correct me if I'm wrong - WE! Because when I'm out on this very slippery limb for you, you have to know what's involved.	Ha!  My right hand hasn't seen my left hand for thirty years!

1 Full of beans, ain't you?  But you know that you'll stand or fall by what you're doing now...	Calculated risk.  Only we happen to know, J.J., that you like me.  I'm your star pupil -- I reflect back to you your own talent.

1 I know...I know you're the strongest cop in town.	I call him the boy with the ice cream face!

1 Don't you ever get messages, Eyelashes?  I called you twice.	I've been up to here.  Listen, honey, tell me something.  You know Susan Hunsecker...?  Has she been in?  I mean lately, in the last coupla days...?
2 I don't think so.	You're sure.  Find out for me.
3 Sidney, can I talk to you a minute?

1 Don't you think I have any feelings? What am I?  A bowl of fruit?  A tangerine that peels in a minute?	I beg your pardon!  I turn myself inside out to help you and now I'm a heavy.  Here's your shoe, there's your coat, that's the door!

1 If that's for me, tear it up!	Take a top coat.
2 And leave a tip in every hat-check room in town?

1 Frank, you don't listen!  J.J. just told you to shut your mouth!	Don't you think it's about time you shut yours?  Who are you to tell a man like Frank D'Angelo to shut up?!

1 It's given me a big lift to know that some people want me for myself, not just because I'm my brother's sister.	Chickie, I'll have to laugh at that - an attractive girl like you...!

1 Listen, when your band was playing at Roseland -	That was two months ago.  Take your hand out of my pocket, thief!

1 Steve, I...	But I don't care about that now. He knew what he was doing today. He was laying down the conditions under which he MIGHT consent to our marriage - if I would bend to every whim of his, like Sidney!  I couldn't do that, Susie...

1 They told us not to ask where they got it.  I thought... Japan... hell, I don't know.  I didn't want to know.	Those lying motherfuckers!
2 I was scary stuff, radically advanced.  It was shattered... didn't work.  But it gave us ideas, It took us in new directions... things we would never have thought of.  All this work is based on it.

1 I'm right here.  I'm fine.  What's the dog's name?	Max.

1 Now remember, you're not gonna kill anyone, right?	Right.

1 Not even of dying?	No.
2 You don't feel any emotion about it one way or the other?	No.  I have to stay functional until my mission is complete.  Then it doesn't matter.

1 Will it melt in there?	Yes.  Throw it in.

1 It's okay.  It'll by okay.  We'll figure it out.	I love you, John.  I always have.
2 I know, Mom.  I know.

1 You said I could be transferred to the minimum security wing and have visitors if I showed improvement in six months.  Well, it's been six months, and I was looking forward to seeing my son.	I see.  Let's go back to what you were saying about these terminator machines.  Now you think they don't exist?

1 The man most directly responsible is Miles Bennet Dyson, Director of Special Projects at Cyberdyne Systems Corporation.	Why him?
2 In a few months he creates a revolutionary type of mircoprocessor.	Then what?

1 Where do you stand on all this?	On all what?
2 On Furtwngler.	I don't know.

1 You think a whole orchestra, what, a hundred and forty or so guys, could be orchestrated?	I guess it's possible.
2 So, what does the Russki want?	Colonel Dymshitz asked specially to see you.
3 'Dim-shits'?

1 Can I ask you a favour, Major?	Yeah.
2 When you question him again, could you treat him with more respect?	With more what? More what?
3 Major, he may just be the greatest conductor of this century and that merits respect.	David, I don't understand a thing about you. You're a Jew. Are you a Jew?
4 Yes, I'm a Jew. But I like to think first I'm a human being.	A human being, oh, good, I'm relieved, I thought you were going to say you were a music lover. This man, this great artist has made anti-Semitic remarks like you wouldn't believe. I got letters.
5 Major, show me someone who hasn't made an anti-Semitic remark and I'll show you the gates of paradise.	What is it with you, David? Where are your feelings? Where's your hatred, your disgust? Where's your fucking outrage, David?

1 Think you can get me any of that?	Oh yes, Major, I have recordings of all his symphonies. I kept them safe during the bombing. My favourite is the Seventh Symphony.
2 Mine's the Eleventh.	But... he only wrote nine, Major.
3 I'm kidding, Emmi. What about a record player? You have that, too?	No. Ours was damaged.
4 What's in those files?	The names of the members of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra since 1934 together with their questionnaires.  Major, what am I to tell Dr. Furtwngler?
5 You tell him nothing, Emmi. If he calls again, you say you know nothing. We're gonna keep him waiting while I get acquainted with his case and with the witnesses. And, God help me, with Beethoven.

1 Or maybe you called Goebbels or Goering? You were so close you were in the same shithouse as them.	May I ask a question?
2 Sure.	When will my case be heard by the Tribunal?
3 Your guess is as good as mine.	I need to work. I need to make my living. I live off the generosity of friends...
4 Tough, tough!	Then why is it, please, that another conductor who was actually a member of the Party, who used to play the Horst Wessel before his concerts, has already been cleared and is working again while I have to wait and wait and wait?
5 I don't know, he wasn't my case. Why did you escape to Switzerland just before the war ended?	It was because I learned that the Gestapo was about to arrest me.
6 Why were they going to arrest you?	I believe it was because of another letter I'd written to Goebbels lamenting the decline of musical standards due to racial policies.
7 You didn't complain about the racial policies, just about the musical standards, is that right?

1 Come on, admit it. K worried you, didn't he? He always worried you. In 1942, he's thirty-four years old, you're already fifty-six. And Goebbels and Goering keep saying to you, 'If you don't do it, little K will.' Never mind art and politics and symbols and airy-fairy bullshit about liberty, humanity and justice because I don't care how great you are. It's the oldest story in the book,  The ageing Romeo jealous of the young buck. The real reason you didn't leave the country when you knew you should have was that you were frightened that, once you were out of the way, you'd be supplanted by the Miracle Kid, the Party's boy twice over, flashy, talented little K.	This is absolute nonsense!
2 Well, I'm just beginning to develop my theme. Isn't that what you call it in classical music, developing your theme? Okay, so they played on your insecurity. That's human, understandable. But, there is one guy who doesn't like little K as much as he likes you - yeah, the number one man your old pal, Adolf. He thinks you're the greatest, and when he says, I want Wilhelm for my birthday, boy, they better go out get Wilhelm. So, Josef calls and threatens you with little K. And you said to hell with the Ninth in Vienna, I'll give it to Adolf as a birthday present in Berlin. That's the trick they played, they got you by the balls and they squeezed. Hard. Why did you stay? Why did you play for them? Why were you the flag-carrier for their regime?  Jealousy?	Of course there was a conspiracy against me, a campaign - even abroad.

1 Is it true you're going to interview Dr. Furtwngler today?	I'll ask the questions, Helmuth.
2 Excuse me. Did you know that he refused to give the Nazi salute when Hitler was present in the audience?

1 I can give you freedom of movement, freedom to work, freedom, Helmuth. But I need something in return.	Major, we're discussing a man of genius, I don't want...
2 Fuck that, Helmuth. You want to discuss symbols here?  This guy was a front man. He was the piper, but he played their tune, you get my philosophical meaning?  I'm not interested in small fish, I'm after Moby Dick. Come on, Helmuth. Hard facts.

1 So, you never heard of him.	Nope.
2 Do you know who Arturo Toscanini is?	Sure.
3 He's as big as Toscanini, maybe even bigger. In this neck of the woods, he's probably Bob Hope and Betty Grable rolled into one.	Jeez, and I never heard of him.

1 Anything else?	A phased plasma pulse-laser in the forty watt range...
2 Just what you see, pal.

1 I haven't seen you in here lately, Mr. Miller.	What's it to ya?
2 You must have a girlfriend.	That's none of your business.
3 Aha!  Is she young?

1 You cold?	Freezing.
2 Come here.

1 Bag some Z's?	Let's get cleaned up, Kyle.

1 Make sure there's none on the threads, like this.  Now screw the end-cap on...very gently.	You must have had a fun child-

1 What are you doing?	Cover...our footsteps...

1 Sarah.  Sarah, this is Dr. Silber- man.  I'd like you to tell him everything Reese said to you.  Do you feel up to it?	I guess so.  You're a doctor?

1 That Silberman just crack me up.  He had this guy in here last week who set his Afghan on fire. Screwed it first, then set it on--	Shut up.

1 I apologize, sir, I'm having a bad day...	A bad month.  You did the exact same thing to me last week.

1 You've got to be kidding.	What... is... happening... ?

1 This is C.R.S.	What's C.R.S.?
2 Consumer Recreation Services.  It's their building.  They...

1 A fresh shirt...	If this was my office, I wouldn't keep that closed.
2 I don't spend much time looking out the window.  I'll call you a taxi.

1 They're watching.	Wha... ?
2 Not here!  They can see.

1 It's just money.  You should be glad you're alive.	It might be best if we didn't talk.
2 All I mean is... someone like you...	How many times have you done this? I'm interested.
3 What?	Scams, con games.  How many?
4 I don't know.  A lot.	Whatever kind of nickel-and-dime shit you did before, this is more than just me.  Your friends raided pension plans, and payrolls... they took just over six-hundred million.  You ruined people's lives.

1 What the fuck are you... ?	Where'd you get that gun?
2 It's mine...	We searched the house.
3 Guess you missed it.	Just... wait.  Just wait!  Okay... please, I'm not kidding anymore...

1 You look good.	So do you.  And to think I was worried...
2 About me?	How long's it been?  Since mom died... four years?  How are you?
3 Never better.	Elizabeth?
4 Divorced.  Remarried to some pediatrician or gynecologist, or pediatric gynaecologist, in Sausalito.	Too bad, I liked her.  So, you're all alone in the House of Pain?
5 I redecorated.  What about you?	Nowhere in particular.  Don't you keep track of my whereabouts anymore?
6 Connie... what brings you here?  Is everything alright?	Yeah.
7 You need anything?	No.
8 Really?	I don't need anything from you.  I was laying on a beach somewhere in Spain, naked, and, it hit me -- Nickie's birthday.  So, here I am, four layovers, twenty-seven hours flying and one donkey ride later. Not necessarily in that order.

1 No!  You're one of them.  Of course, it makes perfect sense!	No, it doesn't!  Those keys were put there.  I didn't even know...
2 You're behind this, aren't you?  You and your sick friends.  Well, make it stop!	Listen to yourself.   Why would I do anything like what you're describing?
3 Because you hate me.  Because you had to be here, when mom died.  Because you had to do it alone.  Well, don't you think if I'd known... I'd've been here too.  I'd have been here...	Stop this.  It's not true...
4 I'm sorry, Christ, I'm sorry!  How many more times do I have to say I'm sorry before you forgive me... ?	Stop it!

1 It's just a t.v.  He's just an actor.	Yes.

1 Get rid of them.	Hey, everyone -- snack time!  Here... here you go...

1 Isn't this what you like?  They told me you had a thing for boats.	First they try to kill me, now you?  Put your damn clothes back on.

1 Your mother thought he was a good man.  He worked very hard.  What I remember most was his manner was so... slight.  It was easy to spend time in a room, and not realize he'd been there the whole time.	Was he morose, or...?  I mean...
2 No.  What happened... no one expected it.	Sometimes I wonder how much of him there is in me.
3 Not much, I think.	I'm just like him.
4 You're not like him at all.  I don't know exactly what's going on around here lately, but don't make me start worrying about you.	Did you worry about him?
5 Nobody worried about your father.

1 Look... what I'm doing is none of your business...	Is Alan Baer "the Game?"  Is that what this is?
2 Friend... why don't you back off.

1 Very well.  If you tell me not to worry, I shan't.	Sam...  Thank you.

1 Couldn't get the last ones.  You?	I did okay.

1 Is that the question of compassion or science?	It's a question.
2 She got the child labor stuff from me.

1 You used the wrong test.	Will the two of you shut up!  God damn it!  Maybe the tests were right, Marrow.  She's sensitive, she's vulnerable, but I don't think she's suicidal and I didn't have to test her.  Maybe she wasn't trying to kill herself. Maybe she was really scared. Maybe she really heard voices.

1 All the carvings.	But there's a sad catch to the story.

1 Nell... please, Nell... take a deep breath...	And they're all locked together in here... and he won't let go of them!

1 Yes, this is Doctor Marrow.	How'd I know it was for you?
2 Because it's my phone.  Yes... Mrs. Dudley, just leave the boxes inside, thank you.  See you soon.  Thank you.

1 Is she asleep?	Yes.  But I promised I wouldn't let her alone the whole night.

1 It's make the soup or answer the door.  Can't do both.	Mrs. Dudley.
2 So far.

1 You've been out of the world for a long time, haven't you?	Yes.  I've missed it.
2 No.  The world has missed you.

1 Well, it wasn't me.  Mister Dudley had to clean it and he knows that he's in charge of all the messes so why would he make more work for himself and...  You said the Good Doctor was with you.	I don't know what to think anymore.
2 Just think about one thing right now: What color?

1 This is real, I'm not making it up!  Theo, you saw it!  You were there -- the banging and last night.  You, you all saw the painting!	Nell, it makes sense.  It all makes sense.  You and I, we were scaring each other, working each other up.
2 -- but the painting!

1 I've lived in L.A. all my life, I've never done this drive.	All your life.  That happened while I swam the length of my pool.

1 Where do <u>you</u> think he is, Mike.	We'll find him.
2 No.  I mean.  Not even your people should be involved.  Right?  It's too close now.	You could use a few of my prime shitkickers up here.
3 You think I'm staying?	There's already gonna be talk about how people close to you keep falling into canyons.
4 Well, can we make it one more.  Nowhere the fuck near me.

1 I never said nothin' about nothin' like that.  No, no, no.  That's not what I wrote to you.	No, but between the lines, eh? Mysterious circumstances, and that.

1 You're kiddin' me, right?	What do I do, then, look in the bleedin' Yellow Pages?
2 These are not guys you can just go run a number on, man.	Thought perhaps there'd be dispensing machines, you know.  Bung in your coins, come out with a .44 Magnum, fully-loaded.

1 Valets.  What d'ya mean valets.  What is he, then, the Earl of fucking Doncaster?	<u>Valets</u>.  They park cars.  He's having a party.

1 ... Reminds me of Jennifer.	Hard to miss.

1 You weren't disappointed in her, then.	In Jenny?  'Course not.  How could I be. 'Course I wasn't.
2 She was twenty-one when she came to me.  ... Straight from leaving you.	Footloose and fancy free.
3 She was happy here.  However the two of you might have parted.  Don't think she wasn't.

1 How did you come to have my address? Found it, did you.  Among her things.	You think Terry gave me access to her things?  Probably sold her clothes.
2 And how did you get it?

1 Where's Big Sur?	Up the coast.
2 How far?	I don't know -- few hours, I guess.
3 Fancy it?	I could use a vacation.  Of course, I keep forgetting, for you this <u>is</u> a vacation.
4 Never thought of that.  Busman's holiday.	What's in Big Sur?
5 That's where Valentine's scarpered.	How do you know?
6 Bloke told me.

1 Out on a oil rig.  In the North Sea. Nine years.	Nine years?  Is that legal?
2 Well, time off for good behavior, you know.  I shouldn't have even been there -- it was these other blokes who shoulda gone in my place.  I got lumbered with the job they were responsible for.  I don't mind pulling me own cart, but not someone else's, know what I mean.	But you stuck it out, anyway, all that time.
3 I had to, didn't I.  Nothing else for it. Then just when I'd finished my nine years -- my contract -- wallop, I had to bugger off to the States.	Sounds like you need a rest.
4 Could do, yeah.

1 So why would he want to see you.	I have a message for him.  About Jennifer Wilson.
2 Jennifer Wilson.

1 Pleasure.	Have we met?  There's something I can't quite --
2 EMI in London.  I work with Ian.	Ah.
3 You must know Ian.	I don't.
4 Great bloke.  Really turned things around there.  180 degrees.	I suppose that's good, unless things were fine the way they were.
5 Oh, I think a shake-up was in order. Definitely.  Otherwise, people get lazy, don't they?  Forgetful.  Start thinking they can get away with things.  Gotta shake 'em up now and again, make 'em pay attention.

1 Hello, Rachel.	I'm so sorry... I was sorry to hear.
2 Yeah. Thanks.

1 ...I guess I've been all wet.	But I do appreciate it, Mr Crane...

1 ...Ed Crane. Remember? Today?	Sorry, friend, I, uh, you got me at a disadvantage.
2 I'm, uh, I'm--the barber.	Jesus! The barber! I'll be a sonofagun. Why didn't you say so? 'Course--the barber.

1 Well, there it is. Writ large in legal escriture, next step is--	Look, uh... Creighton...

1 Your place?	I'm at Nirdlinger's. Let yourself in.
2 OK.

1 ...What a knucklehead.	Who?
2 Dave.	How's that?
3 Ahh...

1 ...Doris--	Nah, don't say anything. I'm alright.

1 ...I gotta hand it to him, he tossed a lot of sand in their eyes. He talked about how I'd lost my place in the universe...	...a puny player on the great world's stage...
2 ...how I was too ordinary to be the criminal mastermind the D.A. made me out to be, how there was some greater scheme at work that the state had yet to unravel, and he threw in some of the old truth stuff he hadn't had a chance to trot out for Doris...	...who among us is in a position to say...
3 ...He told them to look at me--look at me close. That the closer they looked the less sense it would all make, that I wasn't the kind of guy to kill a guy, that I was the barber, for Christ's sake...

1 ...Did you make that up?	Oh, no. That was written by Mr Ludwig van Beethoven.

1 This is what family is for, Ed! This is when ya come together!	Yeah.
2 Close ranks! Goddamnit! Those sons of bitches!	Frank, uh, you know I'll try to contribute, but, uh--Freddy Riedenschneider--
3 I don't care what it costs! This is when ya come together!	That's very generous.
4 The hell with it, Eddie!

1 Hello!	Hello.

1 Uh, Vince.  Sorry.  This won't wait.	It better be good.
2 There are a couple of kids who were lost yesterday near the site of the murder.  Claimed they saw a monster. They're pretty determined to tell you their story.  You want to see them?	No.

1 If the party goes forward, and that's a big if... I've arranged for a large police presence.	Do they have to wear uniforms?
2 Yes.	I don't want to scare people.
3 I understand.  But Mr. Cuthbert, we've got bigger problems.  Depending on what we find today, we may have to shut you down.

1 D'Agosta?  Ippolito.  Come in.	Where the hell are you?
2 I made it outside.  I'll co-ordinate the rescue efforts from here.  Help is on the way.  Just sit tight.	It's a little late, you son of a bitch.  There's a friggin' monster loose in here!  Get the FBI, the fire department.  Find metal cutters, cut through.  And bring a cannon.  The damn thing is huge.

1 What happened to them?	If you don't mind a suggestion, you might try a saliva test.

1 Did you hear that?  My God.  He says that Mbwun is real!	Pardon my French, but bull shit.
2 This on top of the scratches... isn't it proof!

1 Dear God.  Where are we, Lieutenant?	I'd say we're in its home.

1 What is it?	I'm not sure.  As you know, the Kothoga lived outside civilization on the tepui for thousands of years. Species flourished in isolation when man and pollution rendered them extinct.  This could be one of the last remaining samples of an unknown plant.
2 Whatever it is, it must be common on the tepui.  John used it as packing material.	You're right.

1 I'm coming with you.	No, Dr. Frock.  You can't.

1 Margo, this is too dangerous.  You always think you can solve everything.  This time you don't have enough information.  The animal might behave in unexpected ways.  Leave her here with me.  Don't put her in danger.	He's right.

1 It had a long tongue, teeth this big and yellow eyes.	They were green eyes and they were slit like a lizard's.
2 They were yellow!	You're color blind.

1 Oh no.  I smell it.	Keep the animal quiet.

1 4-monoxytocin is... "A hormone secreted by the human hypothalamus gland."	Try Weinstein's tropic hormone.

1 What happened?	I don't know.
2 I heard you calling and I ran after you, but you kept disappearing and I couldn't keep up.	You were behind me?  Running after me?

1 That was D'Agosta.	The planetarium!
2 Vince!

1 No!  Don't kill him!  Pendergast, you were right.  It's John!	What?
2 That thing is John Whittlesley.  I should have seen it before!  The fibers are infected with a virus. You eat them, and the virus alters your DNA!  He became addicted to them in South America, followed the plants back to the states.  He probably entered the country as a man.  It would have taken several months for the change to take place. That's how he got from the boat to the museum!

1 We've declared a curfew.  Everyone else is at first positions.	All prop cars accounted for?
2 He has to be on foot.  He has the world's most recognizable face.  He can't disappear.

1 Are we talking Emmies?	Certainly a nomination.
2 Of course, Truman has always been very much in on casting.	As with our own lives, the only people he can't cast are his family.  Otherwise he has final approval, able to elevate an extra into a lead role as was the case with his only real friend, Marlon, or alternatively relegate a star to a bit player.
3 Istanbul, Turkey, you're on with master videographer, Christof.

1 What's he doing?	They removed all physical trace of her but they couldn't erase the memory.
2 The memory of who?	Shhh!

1 See here, this is us.  All the way round here, Fiji.  You can't get any further away before you start coming back.  Y'know, there are still islands in Fiji where no human has ever set foot.	So when are you leaving?
2 It's not that simple.  Takes money, planning.  You can't just up and go.  Oh, I'm going to do it, don't worry about that.  I've just got to move slow.  Pick my moment.  Bonus time's just around the corner.  Soon as I finish the...	Nursery?
3 <i>Spare room</i> - I can start thinking about selling up...and I'll be gone.  Up and away on that big steel bird.  I'm going, don't you worry about that.

1 What's that?	It's a surprise.

1 Come on, Truman.  Haven't you studied enough?	I still want to look over a couple of things.

1 Truman, I took the "hypocrite" oath!	I bet you did.

1 You know surprises aren't good for me. You should really call before you come over, dear.	I've got something to tell you.  You'd better sit down.

1 Not supposed to talk about it.	You're not supposed to talk about it? Who told you that?

1 You've been back to Dallas?	Yes.
2 Are you going to let us in on what exactly you're trying to prove --	That the bombing in Dallas may have been to destroy the bodies of those firemen, so their deaths and the reason for them wouldn't have to be explained --
3 -- those are very serious allegations, Agent Scully --	Yes. I know.

1 Who called this meeting?	Strughold. He's just gotten on a plane in Tunis.

1 How's that?	Standing around holding your yank while bombs are exploding.

1 I was right about Dallas. Wasn't I, Agent Mulder?	How?
2 I picked up the historical document of the venality and hypocrisy of the American government. The daily newspaper.	You said the firemen and the boy were found in the temporary offices of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Why?
3 According to the newspaper, FEMA had been called out to manage an outbreak of the Hanta virus. Are you familiar with the Hanta virus, Agent Mulder?	It was a deadly virus spread by field mice in the Southwest U.S. several years ago.
4 And are you familiar with FEMA? What the Federal Emergency Management Agency's real power is? FEMA allows the White House to suspend constitutional government upon declaration of a national emergency. To create a non-elected government. Think about that.  What is an agency with such broad sweeping power doing managing a small viral outbreak in suburban Texas?	Are you saying it wasn't such a small outbreak?

1 I know you're bored in this assignment, but unconventional thinking is only going to get you into trouble now.	How's that?
2 You've got to quit looking for what isn't there. They've closed the X-Files. There's procedure to be followed here. Protocol.	What do you say we call in a bomb threat for Houston. I think it's free beer night at the Astrodome.

1 Something's not right...	-- Mulder! Get in the car!

1 Why are you whispering?	I can't really talk right now.
2 What did you find?	Evidence of a massive infection.
3 What kind of infection?	I don't know.
4 Scully -- listen to me. I'm going home, then I'm booking a flight to Dallas. I'm getting you a ticket, too.	Mulder --
5 I need you there with me. I need your expertise on this. The bomb we found was meant to destroy those bodies and whatever they were infected by.	I've got a hearing tomorrow --
6 -- I'll have you back for it, Scully. Maybe with evidence that could blow that meeting away.	Mulder -- I can't -- I'm already way past the point of common sense here --

1 What?	I've got to be in Washington D.C. in eleven hours for a hearing -- the outcome of which might possibly affect one of the biggest decisions of my life. And here I am standing out in the middle of nowhere Texas, chasing phantom tanker trucks.
2 We're not chasing trucks, we're chasing evidence --	-- of what exactly?!
3 That bomb in Dallas was allowed to go off, to hide something: bodies infected with a virus you detected yourself.	They haul gas in tanker trucks, they haul oil in tanker trucks -- they don't haul viruses in tanker trucks.
4 Yeah, well they may this one.	What do you mean by haul?  What are you not telling me here?
5 This virus -- it... 	Mulder --
6 It may be extraterrestrial.	I don't believe this. I don't fucking believe this.  Y'know, I've been here... I've been here one too many times with you, Mulder.
7 Been where?	Pounding down some dirt road in the middle of the night. Chasing some elusive truth on a dim hope, only to find myself standing right where I am right now: at another dead end --

1 Why was I assigned to you? To debunk your work. To reign you in. To shut you down.	You saved me, Scully.  As different and frustrating as it's been sometimes, your goddamn strict rationalism and science have saved me a thousand times; have kept me honest and made me whole. I owe you so much, Scully, and you owe me nothing.  I don't want to do this without you. I don't know if I can. If I quit now, they win.

1 Why don't you go on ahead head and I'll confirm authorization.	Thank you.

1 What is it?	A weak vaccine against the virus Agent Scully has been infected with. It must be administered with ninety six hours.
2 You're lying.	No. Though I have no way to prove otherwise. The virus is extraterrestrial. We know very little about it, except that it is the original inhabitant of this planet.
3 A virus?	A simple, unstoppable lifeform. What is a virus but a colonizing force that cannot be defeated? Living in a cave, underground, until it mutates. And attacks.
4 This is what you've been conspiring to conceal? A disease?	No! For God sake you've got it all backwards.

1 We're going to tell them what we've found. What we've learned. Turn over a body infected with the gestating organism.	In hope of what? Learning that it's true?! That we are nothing more than digestives for the creation of a new race of alien lifeforms?!
2 Let me remind you who is the new race. And who is the old.  What could be gained by withholding anything from them; By pretending to ignorance? Our knowledge may forestall their plans to step up the timetable. To start Colonization early.	And if it doesn't? By cooperating now we're but beggars to our demise! Our ignorance was in cooperating with the Colonists at all.
3 Cooperation is our only chance of saving ourselves.

1 He creates the obstacles, he decides which games to play.	I've heard this argument before.  It's not happening.
2 It could take years for me to get past the barriers he's created.	If we reverse the feed and bring Edward into your mind, it could be devastating for him.  Imagine the shock of suddenly existing in a whole other world.
3 I do it all the time!	Yes, but, you're a willing participant. Picture Edward in a strange place, lost, frightened...
4 I'd be there for him.	And he might blame you for terrifying him.  That one moment could erase all you've accomplished.  And if that happened, the trust he has in you is gone.
5 Okay, okay...

1 Damn him.	What's wrong?
2 Agent Novak.  I didn't get a chance to clear him.

1 Absolutely.  I suppose everyone does.	Just like we all have fantasies, right? Things only we know, that we don't share.
2 That's what therapists are for, right?

1 Where the hell are we?	Carl, do you know?  Like on a map...

1 You liked him?	He's beautiful...

1 I hate to admit it, but there's something perversely satisfying about this.	I think that's the whole point.

1 I have to ask you some things... Are you taking any prescription drugs?	Prevacid.  For my stomach.
2 Any psychiatric medication?	No.
3 What about narcotics?	No.
4 I know your partner's here, but it's very important that you're honest.	I am.  I'm a pretty boring guy.
5 I doubt that.

1 Here he is.	Damn, man, I give up.  Your partner tells you his wife's gonna have a baby, and all you care about is a coroner's report!

1 Den leuten.	Ja, ja, ja.
2 Sayen sie ed our den Leuten damit sie es auch wissen.

1 He said he remembered me too. Seems to show he wasn't in much pain.	Dr. Winkel told me that.
2 Dr. Winkel? Who is he?	The doctor Harry used to go to. He was passing just after it happened.
3 His own doctor?	Yes.
4 Were you at the inquest?

1 Who are you looking for now?	Sssh. Don't. Don't, please.
2 Silly looking bunch.

1 Oh, that was many years ago.	Tell me more.
2 Oh, it's very difficult. You know Harry...we didn't do...

1 ...you know.	He told you, didn't he?

1 What is going to happen? Where is Harry?	He's safe in the Russian zone.
2 How do you know?	I saw him today.

1 Must you take those letters? CALLOWAY Yes, I'm afraid so.	They're Harry's.
2 That's the reason.	You won't learn anything from them. They are only love letters. There are not many of them.
3 They'll be returned to you, Miss Schmidt, as soon as they've been examined.	There's nothing in them.

1 I said another man was buried in his place.	Where's Harry?
2 That's what we want to find out.	I'm sorry - I don't seem able to understand anything you say. He's alive now this minute - he's doing something.
3 Miss Schmidt, we know he is somewhere across the canal in the Russian sector... You may as well help us. In a few minutes Colonel Brodsky will be questioning you about your papers. Tell me where Lime is.	I don't know.
4 If you help me, I am prepared to help you. ANNA Martins always said you were a fool...

1 Please keep this passport to yourself, until I make some inquiries, will you, Major?	Yes, of course.
2 Thank you.

1 ...to him.	What are you trying to say?
2 He was...

1 Get the next plane.	As soon as I get to the bottom of this, I'll get the next plane.
2 Death is at the bottom of everything, Martins. Leave death to the professionals.	Do you mind if I use that line in my next Western? You can't chuck me out, my papers are in order.

1 ...in the morning.	Thank you. Excuse me.

1 Wait a minute - let me out.	Well, there's not much time.
2 One can't just leave - please.

1 ...his number.	I'll look it up for you.
2 Well, look, is there a car here I can use?

1 Oh, Mr. Martins, good evening.	Good evening Mr. Crabbin.

1 Listen, Harry - I didn't believe that...	It's good to see you, Holly.

1 Have you ever seen any of your victims?	Do you know, I don't ever feel comfortable on these sort of things...Victims?

1 Not necessarily. She'd probably want to help.	What's the good of another post mortem? Suppose you dig up something - well - discreditable to Harry?
2 Will you give me...

1 Could he have been at all conscious?	I understand...

1 Happened...Yes happened right down there.	You saw it?
2 Not saw, heard...heard. I heard the brakes. Wham! And I got to the window and saw them carry the body to the other side of the er...er Joseph...that's Joseph Emperor Joseph Statue.	Why didn't they bring him in the house?

1 Harry...	Two double whiskeys. Was wunschen sie?

1 Should I make it all fact?	Why no, Mr. Martins.

1 What are you doing in Thailand? Tourist?	Traveler.
2 You go to Patpong? See smoke from pussy, ping pong ball from pussy, razor blade from pussy; bird from pussy.	I don't think so.
3 Why not? Thai girls best in the world. Thai food best in the world. Thai dope best in the world.	I wouldn't know anything about that, sir.

1 Richard - I saw a fin!	What!
2 A fin!

1 Hi.	Hi there. Here, take a look.

1 But, Danny, if HaShem is everything, and we are nothing how are we to judge His actions?	We have free will and intelligence -- which God allegedly gave us....

1 What do you think you're doing?	Who the fuck are you?
2 Who am I?? Who are you, you schmucks, you can't even make a decent swastika.... Give me the paint.  Give it to me.

1 Yeah, but not on the letters.	Why the fuck not?
2 Just don't.

1 I bet. He didn't realize that nobody who talks such a good game ever plays one.	You weren't complaining about my play last time.

1 Put something on. You're not supposed to be naked in front of it.	Why not?
2 They think it's the word of God, and it's holy, and the flesh isn't....	That's stupid.
3 Yeah, it's stupid.  Put it on, or I won't teach you.

1 Come on, we can be like Eichmann. He studied Torah. He hated Jews.	Is it like Eichmann? Are we goofing?
2 I don't know. I just want to try it.	Shit...  Did you talk to your mother today?
3 No. What are you looking for?	Nothing.  Why are you doing this?  I thought God didn't exist.
4 He commands it whether He exists or not...  Look, we can fight him and be crushed. Or we can submit.	And be crushed.
5 Yeah, okay. But what if...what if... submitting...being crushed, being nothing, not mattering, what if that's the best feeling we can have?

1 An investment banking house.	He's Jewish? Manzetti?

1 Is it okay if I record this?	No... Yeah, fine, go ahead... So what's this about? Is this about me?
2 I'm trying to figure out where the radical right is going to next....I thought you were the most interesting person at that meeting.	What about Curtis Zampf?
3 Curtis is a politician -- and a bit of a hustler. He's not a thinker.	I agree.
4 The other night you said the modern world is a Jewish disease. Could you elaborate on that?	In the movement -- the racialist movement -- we believe there's a hierarchy of the races. Not just in IQ, but in the civilization, the art, the forms of government, the civilizations that each race produces... Why are you writing this down if you're recording it?
5 It helps me concentrate.... So does that mean you're a white supremacist?	What should I be, a white inferior- ist? A multicultural Zulu egalitarian? Let me ask, where are your people from?
6 My mother's family is French, my father's was German, originally.	German. Mine, too. So who do you think's given more to the world, the Germans -- Beethoven, Goethe, Nietzsche -- or the entire continent of Africa? Ibos, Bantus, Mandingos...
7 Danny, what about the Jews?

1 You know the joke: a Jew's shipwrecked on a desert island. When they rescue him, they see he's built two synagogues. They say, for vhat do you need two synagogues? He says, vun to pray in, and vun I'd never set foot in so long as I live, so help me God.  You pray in the one you'd never set foot in...and vice versa.	I can't help what I think.
2 This is me.

1 Hello...?	Lina... It's happening. Tonight.
2 What is happening?	Beth Shalom. Like you wanted.
3 Beth Shalom? What are you talking about? Who is this...?	Lina, you said if I was going to plant a bomb, I should --

1 That was unbelievable what you did to Lucas. The guy's an animal.	You could do it.
2 Get out of here....	You look right through him. He's there, but there's something on the other side of him that you want. It's all you want. And whatever's in the way doesn't matter.... Then it's easy.

1 Not too fast.	You said they didn't have night guards.
2 They don't. I checked twenty times.... Somebody must have talked.	Who even knew?
3 Mrs. Moebius.	Why? Why would she?
4 The Manzetti thing must have scared her. She thinks she'll get implicated.	So what do we do with the device?

1 Who'd you kill?	Four. But no one this important.

1 Who's this?	Dennis Leary.
2 Leary?	No.

1 Do you think I...	Danny, please, we don't want to know.

1 You're leaving?	Yes...  Could you please give this to Enzo.
2 Of course.

1 I wish, but it's full.  They recommended a pension in town. They say that all of Taormina is full.  What's going on here?	It's the Free Diving World Championship.  I am by the way world champion!

1 And the lights!  Running lights, stealing stretchers...!  You'll have us in jail.	Enzo, stop bitching, will you?

1 How did it happen?	The company asked me to extract everything I could from the wreck; so the divers were trying to get at the engine... and then the boat turned over... in the current... and... look, I fucked up!  Can you help?
2 How many are, down there?

1 Is he here?	He's training.

1 ... So, after all these years, you must have lots of questions to ask.  Am I right?	Yes, of course.  Lots of questions.

1 Why?	... For the mermaids.

1 Can I come in?	No problem, I enjoy talking in my sleep.

1 ... Push me back in the water...	I can't.
2 Jacques, take me back down... Please.

1 Yes... Maybe... I don't know.  I don't like competitions... It ruins the fun.  Don't you think?	I guess... But you know... I'm American and I've mostly been taught to be competitive... There's always pleasure of being the best?
2 Maybe on earth there is one... but not when you dive... You see, to dive deep into the sea, for no reason... just to do it.  It's a feeling... I don't know how to say this... Voluptuous?

1 Jacques, you set a world record.	I did?
2 Aren't you happy?  Don't you feel proud...?  I feel proud and all I did was watch.

1 And you?	I didn't dive.
2 You'll try again tomorrow?	I don't know... it didn't feel right.  I'm going to bed.  I'm tired.

1 This is the hotel San Domenico?	Yes Sir, and it has been so for 127 years.
2 Yes, but... So, you haven't got a room left?	No Sir, the hotel is full because of the Diving championship.
3 Ah?!

1 I changed the lock you son of a bitch!	... Sally?

1 Who... Who is that?	Mayol... Jacques Mayol.
2 That's the experiment?  Dumping a guy into a frozen lake?

1 I guess I could be chalant about it, but then again I'm not even sure if that's a word. Listen Chief, we could stand around arguing all day, but I gotta case to crack.	What's your first move?
2 I'm gonna pay a visit to the K.L.F. See if they've got the 411 on Santa's location. I'll check in with you when I know more.

1 Hanukkah, Shmanukkah. It isn't even one of the high holidays. What concerns me more is that my boychick is almost thirty, and has yet to settle down with a nice Jewish girl.  I'll make you a deal. I'll help you with your little Hanukkah problem if you help me with my Mordechai.	What do you want me to do?
2 He works too much. God forbid he should have a nice Jewish girl come eat by him once in a while. Take his mind off his work. Maybe a blowjob here and there.

1 Want to get a drink?	Sure. Why not.

1 We do!	I'm sorry Esther, I just don't think we can see each other romantically anymore.

1 ...and the opportunity to help my brothers and sisters in the Jewish community.	Well I'm just glad you're safe Bubba Shaina, and eating by your mother for Shabos.

1 Actually, I...I don't. What does that mean?	Oh. It means that Santa's gonna fuck Hanukkah's shit up.
2 Not if I can help it. You got any information for me?

1 Listen cat, I'll have you know that I hate the taste of watermelon and am a terrible basketball player.	Well that's good news for us. It means the system is outdated. This should be easy. C'mon.

1 So, what's our first plan of attack Santa?	While I was in Taiwan negotiating the solution to our labor problems, I came across a factory that illegally manufactures the most addictive, Jewish pride weakening substance on the planet. I bought the entire plant.

1 What day is it?	It's Friday.

1 Here is something that should interest Charlie - a stone leopard head made by his ancestors some six hundred years ago. They used it in ceremonies. The jaguar -- in fact all the cat family -- were considered the personification of force and violence in their religious rites.	It don't look like a leopard to me.

1 I'm sick.	Here have a cigarette. He was only kidding.
2 No, he wasn't kidding. I'm sick. Claw women? Hurt little girls? No!

1 Something black - something on its way to you 	Go on -

1 Oh, dear -- I don't know what I'm going to do without you - honestly, I don't 	Hey  I'm over here.
2 I'll miss you too, honey --

1 Charlie and I were talking. That's one reason I wanted to see you.	About Charlie's leopard?
2 Yes.

1 Tormented -- ? Why?	I couldn't rest - I couldn't sleep. All I could see was Teresa Delgado's body -- broken --mangled. I saw it day and night.  It was waiting everywhere I turned.
2 Then you found the leopard --	I didn't want to kill, but I had to. I heard her in the cemetery - talking to the man in the auto --

1 I haven't done any posse work since last time I rode with Toni Mix at the old Bijou Theatre -- aged six, If you're interested,	Go on foot.
2 It's not for me.  I'm literally and figuratively a tenderfoot.

1 Get it out of here!	Kiki -- he won't hurt you. There's nothing to be afraid of.
2 Makes no difference. Get him out!	Listen, Kicks, you'll never guess what I've cooked up this tine...
3 That's easy. Me.	I thought -- is Kiki just going to walk on that floor tonight walk out cold before a bunch of gawks who think a Spanish twirler is the greatest thing in life. No. Not my favorite client. She's going to make an entrance this town will never forget!
4 On his back, I suppose.	No. I thought that might be just a little corny. I want you to lead him in on a leash.
5 You're too good to me.	Look, Kicks, have I ever done anything to hurt you?
6 No - not yet.	And I never will- you know what's between us  we're a thing But this is serious competition.
7 Get it out of here!	Kiki - he won't hurt you. There's nothing to be afraid of.
8 Makes no difference.  Get him out.	Listen, Kicks, you'll never guess what I've cooked up this time.
9 That's easy. Me.	I thought - is Kiki just going to walk on that floor tonight walk out cold before a bunch of gawks who think a Spanish twirler is the greatest thing in life. No. Not my favorite client. She's going to make an entrance  this town will never forget.
10 On his back, I suppose.	No. I thought that might be just a little corny.  I want you to lead him in on a leash.
11 You're too good to me.	Look, Kicks, how long have we known each other?
12 This is l939. Can't you subtract?	Almost three years, isn't it? And have I ever done anything to hurt you?
13 No  not yet.	And I never will -- you know what's between us - we're a thing -- But this is serious -- big competition.
14 Clo-Clo?	I thought you might strut this kitten in right in the middle of her act.

1 I can use them.	Do they close up every year for this Processionist business?

1 You already know the answer to that. I want this town to be safe and happy again --	I'm no detective. I don't even know how to begin. All I know is I want to do something about all this.

1 By the way, Laurence, were you here last time your mistresss brother came over? You know, just before he disappeared?	I work here, sir. Im here most of the time.
2 You wouldnt recall if the brothers-in-law left together, would you?	You will have to ask Mr De Moraes that, sir.  Would you like a drink while you wait?
3 No. Thank you. Ill be fine...

1 Laurence!	I was hired by your parents, Mrs De Moraes.

1 Mr Lombard. Mrs De Moraes...	Uh... Wait a moment, Mrs De Moraes...

1 I doubt Friedman ever even met Leon, Deborah. Friedman dealt with select customers. As for my envelope, had he know where it was he wouldnt have mistaken me for a hitman called Lamont when we met in Los Angeles.	...You-you spoke to him?
2 Not in the strict sense of the word, no. He was in too much of a hurry to kill me when we first met and too wasted in acid when I caught up with him later.

1 Directory enquiries. Can I help you?	Yes. Im trying to reach a friend but I cant get through. The number is 01766 770 471.
2 01766 770 471. Let me check it for you, sir.

1 Where were you staying before the attempt on your life and why cant you go back there?	The Mondrian, room 504. I was checked out in my absence.
2 By your Austrian?	Yeah.

1 What am I to do with the packages if...	Burn the passport and keep the money. Think of it as a donation to the cause...

1 Nothing sticks to slime, Emily.  This should cover what you lent me.	Huh! And they say charitys only rewarded in Heaven... Hallelujah...  Christ...

1 Youre not playing with little boys now, scumbag. Where is the Austrian?	Jee... Fuck... Youre fucking mad!

1 Have you heard of a French film called La Collectionoose?	La what?
2 La collectionoose. Its about a young girl in the south of France who seduces a different man every night and then meets one who resists her. Its on TV tonight and as Im in I thought we could perhaps look at your accounts and... The review says its about the conflict between intellect and instinct. And witty. The directors supposed to be famous. Rommel or something. French. You must know him?	Should I?
3 I dont know. How many famous French film directors can there be?	That are called Rommel or something, I guess not that many. 
4 So you havent seen the film, then?	Its Friday night, Jane. What happened to your latest boyfriend?
5 Oh... We split up.	Well, I hope youre not too heartbroken and...
6 Oh no. Im all right. He was a jerk, really. Another boy, you know? All I meet is boys. When I think of all the fuss about older men fancying young girls. I mean, is it true?

1 Whatever, you come recommended. We...	Recommended?
2 Must I speak to you in French?	Didnt you say I came recommended?  Thats what I thought. May I know by whom?
3 You may not. And besides, it is irrelevant.	Okay. Recommended...
4 Good. Now, as I trust you may have guessed, we are looking for someone to work for us. Someone whose discretion can be relied upon. Someone who while in our employ would give us full commitment. Do you think you could be that person, Mr Lombard?	Look Mrs Spitz... I dont know to whom Im indebted for the recommendation but... Im not in the business of making oaths of allegiance or giving myself character references. What I do is listen to what the people who care to call me have to say and judge whether or not I can be of help. I hope you can appreciate that, Mrs Spitz.
5 What I can appreciate is insolence, Mr Lombard!

1 Vous tes Franais?	Does it matter?

1 Is this Friedman?	Who are you? Who are you working for, huh?
2 Is this Friedman, Martin?  Come on, scumbag. Youve reached your sell- by date. Tell me if this is Friedman, where he is in Los Angeles and what name hes using?	Youre making a mistake, tough guy. Whoever he is, your guys not one of Friedmans...
3 You seem very sure about that.	I told you... The rabble, its me...  Huh... Its sad.
4 What is?	Dying without ever reaching the top...

1 This is private property. The public footpath is back to the left of the bridge.	How are you, Rhian?

1 He showed me a book with a picture of a couple caught kissing in a street...	Hows the boy doing?
2 Fine...	Good. You neednt worry about the Austrian anymore. Hes dead. Ill be in touch.

1 Alors?	Alors quoi?
2 Le montage, lemballage. Not your regular street muck, is it? This is collectors stuff. How much would it cost me?	A lachat, trois ou quatre mille. En location, cinq cent. Mais a pourrait faire plus. Je ne sais pas. Cest pas vraiment mon truc.  I dont know any Austrian, Xavier.
3 But maybe you know someone who does. An Austrian, in London, dealing in kids and snuff videos. How many can there be? These people supply to order. He has to be known, reachable.	Then why dont you reach him?
4 I dont have your credentials, Nathalie.

1 Ha ha... Yes. With prices reaching an all time low, the name of the game has become have-it- where-its-at... As we all know, transportation has always been the costliest and trickiest part of this business...	Cost what?
2 Costliest!	Whats that? A word?
3 What do you think?	I dont know. Could be the sound of jewellery hitting a parquet floor, huh?
4 Very funny. Can I go on now?	Sure. But speak English, will ya, ha ha...

1 Listen, please accept my apologies for... you know, me pretending to be the... well it wasn't really my idea... well, yes it was my idea but...	Do you think I could have some water?

1 Not so... easily.  Why aren't you... fighting...?  go on... we're almost there...	Jeanne, you've been badly wounded...
2 No, it's... it's nothing, it's...

1 That's not what I asked... Why do you want to marry me?	You listen to your voices, I listen to my heart.

1 Jeanne's alive!	Good.
2 We have to press home the attack!	Sound the retreat...
3 But I promised Jeanne we'd fight on!	I made no such promise.  Sound the retreat for the night!
4 But that was her order!	I'm fed up with taking her orders. She swore she'd defeat the English before nightfall, instead of which she goes and plays the fool and gets herself nearly killed!  Look at the mess we're in!  That's her mess, not mine...!  We're worse off then if she'd never come at all!  ... now do as I say and Sound the Retreat!

1 Arrest them!	What are you doing?  This is an ecclesiastical court -- you have no right to do this!
2 Rouen is in English territory.  I have the right to do anything I like.  Take them away.

1 Really?	I was talking to the priest, and do you know what he said to me?

1 Jeanne, you are not helping yourself.  If you don't answer our questions properly, your refusal will be taken into account.	These questions have nothing to do with your trial.
2 I assure you they do.  So... answer me... when was the last time you heard this voice?	Not long ago...
3 When exactly?  A day, a week -- when?	Last night.

1 I ask only one thing... to hear me in confession...	I -- I can't Jeanne... I can't hear your confession... I'm sorry...

1 I don't need lodgings if we're to be marching on Orleans...	Orleans has held out for six months. I don't suppose a few days will make much difference.  Take some rest.

1 When you saw your king for the first time, was there an angel over his head?	If there was, I didn't see it...
2 Then why did your king believe in you without any proof?	Go and ask him yourself.

1 Dunois... was it you who ordered the attack?  Answer me?!	Can we -- uh -- discuss this later?
2 Sooner is better than later!

1 I do love her when her fire gets well and truly stoked!	Me too...

1 Right behind us -- Dunois with another then thousand men!	Jeanne, look behind you.
2 Never look behind -- only ahead!

1 What happened?  Who gave the order to attack?	God knows, but it was a bad idea!
2 Were the men confessed?  Where are the priests?

1 When you were taken prisoner at Compiegne, did you have a horse?	Yes... a half-steed... white.
2 Who gave you that horse?	My king.
3 How many did he give you?	Five steeds and a few hackneys...
4 As much as for a Lord?  What an honor!  Did your king give you other wealth apart from horses?	No.
5 What about all those dresses you were given... silk dresses weren't they?	Yes, I was given a few, but I never had time to wear them...
6 Still, pretty wealthy for a peasant girl wouldn't you say?	And you look pretty wealthy for a servant of God, wouldn't you say?

1 My... visions...	They're going to come and visit you in here?
2 Yes... that's what I pray for...!	I want to see that.  Do you mind if I stay... on the side?  I won't bother you.
3 No, no -- you can't stay or they won't come!	Why not?
4 Because... I have to be alone!

1 There's nothing for me to do here anymore... I don't belong here I want to be with Him now...	Do you think you are ready?

1 He says... he says I must be good... and help everyone... and take care of myself.  Do you think he's coming from the sky?	Perhaps... but wherever he comes from, I think you should listen to him, because it sounds like he's giving you very good advice.

1 I nagged Jurek for weeks and weeks. And at last he gave in and said, 'All right, come with me tomorrow,' and so I came and they bombed the station.	You know something? Meeting you like that was absolutely wonderful.
2 Really?	Yes!  It was...it was unforgettable.

1 What did I tell you?	What are you doing?

1 What's happened?	Oh my God, it's terrible, you've got to do something, oh my God!
2 Calm down, what, what is it?	They're hunting people on the streets. They've picked up Henryk.

1 Mama, that was a great dinner.	It certainly was.

1 Very appropriate.	Yes, that's why I brought it.

1 If I play like an angel, why don't you listen?	I was listening, Kitten.
2 Liar, you fell asleep. Pig!

1 You don't remember me, Mr. Szpilman?	No, I don't think so?
2 Warsaw Radio. I was a technician. I saw you almost every day.	Sorry, I don't remember.
3 Doesn't matter. You've nothing to worry about. I'll visit often.

1 Watch your feet!	Watch your feet!

1 How are the lessons going? ADA nods enthusiastically. He's getting on all right? ADA nods again Good.	That is good, yes.

1 I worry for you.	No, I love her, we will be a family. I have her piano. I will mend it, she will get better.
2 I miss you.

1 I don't think you should have given up the piano. I will make sure you are properly taught, with music written on to sheets and...	I don't want to learn.
2 You don't want to learn.	No.
3 And what does this do to our bargain? I cannot afford the piano if you mean me to pay.	No, no payment. I have given it back. I don't want it.
4 Well, I doubt I want it very much myself.	It was more to your wife that I gave it.
5 Well, thank you, I expect she will appreciate it.

1 What?	She says, throw it overboard. She doesn't want it. She says it's spoiled
2 I have the key here, look, I'll have it mended...

1 He's given it to us.	Hah, you're very cunning Ada, but I've seen through you, I'm not going to lose the land this way. Wait here!

1 The wallet.  You gotta go after him. He's got all the money.	Don't worry, we got the wallet. What happened?  He get ya with the knife?

1 ...It's the only reason I ain't quit before now.	What?
2 I'm gettin' too slow for this racket.  I done the best I'm gonna do.  You hang on too long, you start embarrassin' yourself.	What are you talkin' about?  We just took off the biggest score we've ever had.  We can do anything we want now.
3 It's nothin' compared to what you could be makin' on the Big Con. You're wastin' your time workin' street marks.	Hey look.  You think I'm gonna run out on ya or somethin'?  Just cause we hit it big.  Luther, I owe you everything.  If you hadn't taught me con, I wouldn't know nothin'.
4 Aw hell, you sound like some goddamn sucker.  You know everything I know.  You got nothin' more to learn from me.	But you played the Big Con.  You said it was nothin'.  A game for flakes and mama's boys.
5 And I'm tellin' ya now, you're a fool if you don't get into it.  A bigger fool than I was.  I been lookin' for this one all my life, Johnny.  Now I got a chance to step out at the top.

1 I thought you blew all your money.	I did.  That stuff I gave him was counterfeit.  They'll pinch him the first place he tries to spend it.

1 We bought ya a tap into Moe Anenberg's wire.  He's got eyes at every track in the country.  You'll get race results, odds, scratches, pole positions, everything; and just as fast as Western Union gets 'em.	Does J.J. know how to use this thing?
2 All he's gotta do is read.

1 You just worry about your end, kid.	If we ever get to it.

1 What's the matter, kid?  You're not sayin' much.	Just a little nervous, that's all.
2 Luther always told me to bite my toenails when I get nervous.  You see yourself doin' that and you realize it ain't worth it.

1 What's the problem?	He wants to put a half million on Syphon.

1 See and raise 1,000.	Raise 5,000.

1 Then I'm afraid we'll have to impound your money until we're sure that it's all good.  Can I see your wallet and your ticket, please?	But I got a train to make.
2 It'll only take 20 minutes or so. You can pick it up at the window down the hall.	But what about all these other people?
3 We'll get 'em!  Give us a chance. I'm not the only agent in here, ya know.  We go around advertising ourselves, how many counterfeiters do you think we'd catch, huh?  You think I'm wearin' this rag here 'cause I like it?  Christ, everybody thinks life's a holiday or somethin' when you got a badge.  I been here since three this morning, Charlie, and I never knew there was so much ugliness in people.  You try to help 'em and they spit on you.  I shoulda let ya go and gotten yourself arrested for passin' false notes.

1 You sure it'll be one of these two?	No.  They're just the only ones we know of.

1 Why me?  Shaw probably has lotsa enemies to choose from.	I need somebody respectable...but not completely legit.  What I'm gonna do isn't very legal.
2 I'm a banker, friend.  That's legit in this state.	All you gotta do is place a bet for me at Shaw's place.  I'll supply all the money and the information.

1 A week's a long time, friend. Anything can happen.  All of it bad.	He's right, Les.

1 Take it easy.  Everything's all right.  I put it on Syphon, on the nose.	On the nose!  I said place.  Place it on Syphon.  That horse is going to run second.

1 I didn't know you invented that Smelting Process.	Look -- those are the first metals that came through. 

1 How are you?	Another young man.
2 It's the same one.

1 Mother ....  you couldn't do that. You couldn't go to her.	I didn't say I would.  But we've got to have money.
2 Did it ever occur to you that Chris might work?	Shush!

1 Not that scrawny little....? 	Yes.
2 How did you ever remember me?	was fascinated with you....  a real live detective....  You used to tell me the most wonderful stories.  Were they true?
3 Probably not.

1 Dead?	He's been dead for three months.

1 Shrapnel!	Must have been in the war.  That might account for the cane and his limp.
2 Yes... yes.

1 This gun yours?	No.
2 Who's is it?	I'll have to try to remember.
3 Okay.  There's plenty of time. I guess we got to ask you a lot more questions than we counted on. We'll come up tomorrow when you're feeling better.  Come on.

1 I guess that cinches it, eh, Mr. Charles?  He killed them both - Julia Wolf and Nunheim.	Fifty will still get you a hundred.
2 This is enough for me.

1 There are a few things we want to check up on.	I see.
2 You say you were in the room with the body from the time you discovered it 'til we came?	Why yes.
3 Did you see anything in Miss Wolfe's hand?	No.
4 Are you sure you didn't leave the room...  that one of the bellhops or maids might not have been in there alone?	I don't think so.  Of course I was terribly upset...  I hardly knew what I was doing.
5 The Medical Examiner seems to think that the body was touched.  He says it looks as if the girl's hand had been forced open after she was killed....

1 Have a shot?	What's the idea of telling me you just knew the Wolfe girl by sight?
2 That's all I did, Lieutenant. That's the God's truth.  Maybe I said hello to her or how are you or something like that when I saw her, but that's all I knew her. That's the truth.  All right.  Put your mouth in and I'll pop a tooth out of it.

1 Who's that man?	He's not anybody.  Just a fellow I used to know.
2 I thought you'd given up that sort of friend.	This is the first time I've seen him in years.  I didn't want him to think I was high-hatting him.
3 I don't like him.	Don't worry.  You won't see him again.  What happened? Did you change your mind about going?
4 No.  I just came back for a second. I wanted to get those bonds.	What bonds?
5 The government bonds.  The ones you took from the office safe.	Oh yes.  Why, you told me to sell them a long time ago.
6 I'd never tell you to sell those. I bought them for my daughter.	Don't you remember....
7 Now see here, Julia.  You're counting a little too much on my being absent-minded.  You've been taking a little here and there for some time, and I haven't said anything about it.  But this is fifty thousand dollars!	Do you realize that you're accusing me of ....
8 No one else had the combination of that safe.  You took them.  What did you do with them?	What if I did take them? I'm sick and tired of seeing you hand out thousands of dollars to that family of yours....
9 That's my business.	supporting that gang of loafers! There's not one of them that cares a damn for you.  A wife who threw you out the first time your foot slipped.  They wouldn't raise a hand to help you.  And I've given my whole life for you.  If you kicked off tomorrow, where'd I be? Out in the gutter!  Sure I took those bonds.  Who has a better right -- ?

1 Thanks, and goodbye.	What'll I do if something comes up?
2 Settle it yourself.  What have I got a lawyer for?	Is Julia going with you?
3 No.

1 I have no right to answer that.	What about it, Tanner.  Isn't that the truth?

1 Because I don't believe that Clyde's dead!  Why, you said yourself you saw him last night.	So I did.  I saw him lying buried in his shop.

1 Pretty girl.	If you like 'em like that.
2 You got types?	Only you, darling...  lanky brunettes with wicked jaws.
3 Who is she?	I was hoping I wouldn't have to tell you.  Dorothy is really my daughter.  You see, it was Spring in Venice, and I was so young.  I didn't know what I was doing.  We were all like that on my father's side.
4 By the way, how is your father's side?	Much better, thanks.
5 How many drinks have you had?	Six Martinis.
6 Six Martinis.  You're not going to have anything on me.

1 Nick!  Nick!  Are you asleep?	Yes.
2 Good. I want to talk to you.	That's jolly.
3 Don't you think you'd like to go back to detecting once in a while, just for the fun of it?	Can't you get to sleep?
4 No.	Maybe a drink would help you.
5 No thanks.	Maybe it would if I took it.

1 You're a fine watch dog.	He's got more sense than you have. Thank Heaven you're not on this case.
2 On it!  I'm in it ... They think I did it!	Well, didn't you?

1 This may be a little rough - you'd better let us go alone.	Catch me letting you go alone!

1 You're going to drive me crazy!	Let's see... where was I?  Oh, yes.  He went to find the man. That man was desperate!  He knew that he was caught dead to rights -- and with prison staring him in the face, he took the only way out. He killed Wynant.  It's terrible to tell you this way but your father's dead, Dorothy.

1 Where are you going?	Home!
2 Home?	I'm fired.
3 Who fired you?	You did.

1 A casual one.	Damn, this is sweet.  We are going to be home in no time.
2 Better grab up some sand to take home to your family.

1 Maybe we are crazy for doing this.  But if we do it, we do it right.  I just needed to explain that in a way I wouldn't have to do it again.	Not much chance of that.  Jaeger's an idiot.
2 He's not so--	He's an idiot, and he's not nearly as hard as he thinks.
3 How tough you have to be to make the army?  All you've got to do is shoot a gun, and stop a bullet.

1 The US Army:  Always an adventure.	Let me see the map.

1 It'll be too dark to make our way back now.  Let's bed down for the night and head out at first light.	What about the gold?
2 What about it?	Maybe we should split it up now.
3 We started this together, and we're staying together, so there's no point in splitting things up now.	What if we get separated?  Way I see it if something happens I want to be carrying my share.

1 We can't just leave him.  He'll run back to his outfit, report our position...	You said he was a deserter.
2 That's what he says.  He could be a spy, or something.	You don't know that.
3 You don't know he isn't.

1 Thanks for taking care of this for me.	Tell me something, Wes.  Are you crazy, greedy, or just stupid?  Jaeger says you're crazy.

1 Oh, man, you're not going to fall for that.	There might be something in there.
2 Yeah, the deed to the Brooklyn bridge.	There might be.

1 It's going to be cool, Wes.  It's all all right.	We go, we get rich, we go home.  It's that easy.

1 Steady it out!	I steady it out, they blow us out of the sand!

1 What?	Mine.  Land mine!

1 You're going to blow yourselves up.	Wes is right.  If there were any more mines we would have found them.  Hell, that one you stepped on was probably old anyway; left over from the war with Iran.
2 You don't know that.  It could be a trick.	If we step on a mine we'll know it was. Let me see the maps.

1 X marks the spot.	Something like that.
2 But the white dot in the middle; that's got to mean something.	I hope it means something, otherwise...

1 It's not like I figured.  It's cold.  And it's heavier than I imagined.	I wouldn't know.  I never imagined this. Not in my whole life did I ever imagine this.
2 You don't have to imagine it.  Not anymore.  Now all you've got to think up is what it's going to buy you.

1 No.	We need something:  A flare, a signal mirror.

1 I pick that way.	Okay.  Then we go this way.

1 Can't you--	I don't have a weapon.

1 Which way do we go!?	We go this way.

1 That shouldn't be too hard to read.  Iraq is the pink thing.	I could use some recon photos too.

1 He says it's a box.	Yeah, you're funny.
2 It's a puzzle box.  If you can figure out how to open it there's supposed to be a treasure inside.	For real?  A treasure?

1 You're not saying what I think you're saying.  I can't believe you're even thinking it.	It's right here.  This region; an-Nagaf. I got recon photos.  There're no troops there, no fighting--
2 You don't know where the Iraqis have moved to.  And our forces haven't even engaged the Republican Guard yet, we don't know--	It's about a hundred miles from where we are now.  How long do you think it would take us to--
3 It's not a hundred miles.  It's a hundred miles through three different kinds of terrain:  Pure desert, mountains, a river.  If the map is even real.	It's real.  I'm telling you, it's real.
4 So you just want to cross into hostile territory in the middle of a war on a wild goose chase?  It's crazy.  Tell him it's crazy, Epps.

1 I thought we were dead.	Yeah, well, we're not.
2 We got to get out of here.

1 Is there anything you do know?	I know you're a pussy.  I know that.

1 Says he's one of the soldiers that was in the helicopter.	He lived through that?

1 HUMMMM.....	What happened?
2 See if you can get a reading on tactal retention.  Try to estimate it without a meter reading.

1 I haven't done anything.	Don't be so sure.

1 What are you doing?	I don't know.

1 But we need a creative dissent. Our voices are not joined in any harmonious chorus, but the differences are differences of emphasis, not of fundamentals. Now, the new alignment's greatest need is to communicate with all its elements, rather than march along in parallel line that never converge.  Tomorrow as we focus the new movement more clearly, we will gain a new unity.	What?

1 I can't see him at all.  He's been destroyed.	No, look!  Three degrees from the central azimuth.

1 I'm leaving.	When?.....How?
2 Right now.	But you can't...you.

1 I knew him.	Soon he'll be a plastic cube.
2 Shut up.

1 ....I'm taking SP5, but it doesn't seem strong enough.  I have a hard time concentrating.  Please forgive me, I slipped on....	You are a true believer.  Blessings of the state, blessings of the masses.  Thou art a subject of the divine.  Created in the image of man, by the masses, for the masses. Let us be thankful we have an occupation to fill.  Work hard; increase production; prevent accidents, and be happy.

1 High-grade det cord. This girl, either she's got strange taste in jewelry or she's into serious demolition.	What do you mean?

1 The place has already be combed. Forensics pulled over a hundred sets of prints inside.	Then let's go see what they missed.

1 Pittsburgh, two years ago. Partner died, no back-up, I was too gung-ho. As usual.	Take a tip from the Bomb Boys, always assess, if only for a second.
2 I know. I was working a drug ring, deep cover. Played the part too well. When they pulled me out, I wasn't a cop anymore. My fiance had dumped me. Next thing I knew, I was out here on the street, doped up, auditioning for the morgue when this tough old vice cop found me, cleaned me up, gave me a second chance. He promised Captain Winters he'd look out for me.	Your partner?
3 I guess I didn't realize how much I needed him. He kept me straight. It's been tough every second since.

1 Keep talking.	Close your eyes, feel your fingertips. Tell me everything you feel.

1 Political.	Exactly my thinking. Except, none of the targets can actually be linked to government, political or special interest concerns. They seem to be just unrelated industrial companies. Some insured, some not. 

1 Lane oil...	A bowling alley.

1 Why are we stopping here?	We're moving' on. I have to pick up the supplies. Just two little boxes.

1 Prints?	Nothing so far.
2 What about the ballistics report?	Lab's backed up, we're still waiting for it.

1 Vice... Jesus.	That'd be some explosive pussy he's got his hands on.

1 We're vice, I didn't see no pimps or hookers in that van. But if you're so gung-ho, we'd best call it in for some back-up.	Nah, let's just take a look-see.

1 Got it! Ace Match Company, Flint, Michigan.	You mean you just--? ... You keep a record of... matches?

1 What's this?	Report on the case so far.
2 You know after a shooting I would normally take your badge and weapon, but Glass called in already and confirmed it was clean.	Yes, sir.
3 But from now on, any leads on this case go to Pluchinsky. He's primary investigator and you are unofficially assigned to the Bomb Squad... you and your new friends are not to be playing detective any more. Got it?

1 M'sieu Giron is downstairs.	Tell M'sieu Giron I can't see him now. Impossible!  And, Jacques. Dismiss the car! Madame is not going. 
2 Yes, M'sieu Laval!

1 What did you talk about?	About tonsils.
2 <u>Tonsili!</u>	So I said to myself, "All right, if he wants to look at them, let him look at them. No harm in that." And then he said, "Say ah." And then I said, "Ah." And that's all I remember ... And when I woke up, I still had my tonsils, but my pocketbook was gone.

1 You're not safe anywhere nowadays.	But please, Baron. We're not supposed to breathe a word of it. You won't tell anybody I told you?
2 You can trust me.	Yes, Baron. Thank you. 

1 Don't stop. Keep right on complaining. It's beautiful.	You know, when I first saw you, I thought you were an American.
2 Thank you!	Someone from another world--so entirely different. One gets so tired of one's own class--princes and counts and dukes and kings--ah! And everybody talking shop--always trying to sell jewelry ... And then I heard your name and found you were just one of us.
3 Disappointed?	No--proud. Very proud!

1 <u>This</u> <u>woman</u> <u>has</u> <u>more</u> <u>than</u> <u>jewelry</u>.	Ah!
2 Did you ever take a good look at her--uh--	Certainly!
3 They're all right, aren't they?	Beautiful. And what of it?  Let me tell you something: so far as I'm concerned, her whole sex appeal is in that safe!
4 Gaston. Let's open it--right now! Let's get away from here!  I don't like this place!	Oh, no, darling. There's <u>more</u> sex appeal coming on the first of the month.  It's only ten days ...  Eight hundred and fifty thousand francs.
5 Darling, remember you're Gaston Monescu. You're a crook. I want you as a crook. I love you as a crook. I worship you as a crook. Steal, swindle, rob--but don't become one of those useless, good-for-nothing gigolos!

1 Goodbye, M'sieu La-- Oh, yes ... This is a rather delicate matter and I don't want to ... You see, if you read my advertisement carefully, you must have noticed that there was ...	In other words, madame, it embarrasses you to offer me the twenty thousand francs reward.
2 Yes.	Don't be embarrassed, madame. I'll take it. I need the money. I wish I were in a position to ignore the whole matter. But you know, madame, the stock market, bank crash ... To make a long story short--a member of the nouveaux poor.
3 Then I'm glad I lost the bag! I'll write you the check immediately. 

1 But incidentally, let me tell you, <u>I</u> don't like <u>you</u>. I don't like you at all!  I wouldn't hesitate one instant to ruin <u>your</u> reputation--like that! 	You would?
2 Yes, I would!	Like that?
3 Like that!	I know all your tricks.
4 And you're going to fall for them.	So you think you can get me?
5 Any minute I want!	You're conceited--
6 But attractive--	<u>Now</u>, <u>let</u> <u>me</u> <u>tell</u> <u>you</u>--
7 <u>Shut</u> <u>up</u>--<u>kiss</u> <u>me</u>!  Wasting all this marvelous time with arguments! 

1 Oh, M'sieu Laval ...	Yes, Madame Colet?
2 Has Mademoiselle Gautier gone?	Yes--uh--
3 Oh, that's too bad. You see, I wanted her to do something.  Well, I guess I'll have to do it myself.	What is it, madame?
4 I wanted to ask her to ask you if you'd be good enough to go out to dinner with me tonight.

1 I think you'd better go.	Ever had a romance with a crook?
2 I beg your pardon!	Let me give you a little advice. When you embrace him, be sure to put on your gloves. It would be too bad if your fingerprints were found ...
3 Mademoiselle Gautier--or whatever your name is--I thank you for your advice, but I must ask you to go. You've got your money--	I don't want your money!

1 Won't you even make a try for it, Mr. Andrews?	I'm sorry that I didn't build you a stronger ship, young Rose.

1 What?	That's the shape my hand's gonna be when I hold that thing. You understand? I'm not leaving here without it.
2 Look, Brock, she's going to do this her way, in her own time. Don't forget, she contacted you. She's out here for her own reasons, God knows what they are.

1 Your daughter is much too hard to impress, Ruth.  Mind your step.	So this is the ship they say is unsinkable.
2 It is unsinkable. God himself couldn't sink this ship.

1 It was once worn by Louis the Sixteenth. They call it Le Coeur de la Mer, the --	The Heart of the Ocean. Cal, it's... it's overwhelming.

1 This should be amusing.	Can I bum a cigarette?

1 The boats are all going.	We gotta get up there or we're gonna be gargling saltwater. Where's Tommy?

1 Take my hand. I'll pull you back in.	No! Stay where you are. I mean it. I'll let go.
2 No you won't.	What do you mean no I won't? Don't presume to tell me what I will and will not do. You don't know me.
3 You would have done it already. Now come on, take my hand.

1 So you feel like you're stuck on a train you can't get off 'cause you're marryin' this fella.	Yes, exactly!
2 So don't marry him.	If only it were that simple.
3 It is that simple.	Oh, Jack... please don't judge me until you've seen my world.
4 Well, I guess I will tonight.

1 Jack, must you go?	Time for my coach to turn back into a pumpkin.

1 I believe you are blushing, Mr. Big Artiste. I can't imagine Monsieur Monet blushing.	He does landscapes.

1 That guy Lovejoy put it in my pocket.	I know, I know.
2 See if you can find a key for these. Try those drawers. It's a little brass one.

1 I don't think I've ever seen such a flat calm, in 24 years at sea.	Yes, like a mill pond. Not a breath of wind.
2 It's make the bergs harder to see, with no breaking water at the base.	Mmmmm. Well, I'm off. Maintain speed and heading, Mr. Lightoller.
3 Yes sir.	And wake me, of course, if anything becomes in the slightest degree doubtful.

1 I can still feel its weight. If you could have felt it, not just seen it...	Well, that's the general idea, my dear.

1 Anya, I think you're crazy.	Any woman's crazy to feel about a man the way I do about you.
2 I wasn't running out on you. When I got over there-- made my plans--I'd have sent for you.

1 Thanks. I'll be there. About seven-thirty?	Sooner--if you like.  See you again, I hope.

1 You'll excuse me. 	Well, it'll have to be poker--but I'm so unlucky in that game.

1 You're coming back--	That depends on how mother's feeling. You'll excuse me, gentlemen?

1 This is great. I'll be able to watch your act every night.	You're not very ambitious, are you?
2 Oh, yes, I am, because <U>afterwards</U>--up here in the moonlight.	You work too fast for me, young man.
3 Aw--give a feller a break. My cards are on the table-- I want to know you. How about dining with me tonight?	Never eat before the show.
4 Well--breakfast?  Lunch?

1 Don't kid me. I'm in no mood for it.	For once I'm dead on the level--  --crazy about you!
2 Will you take some advice?  If you're looking for romance--count me out--  --if you know what's good for you.	But--
3 --I know what I'm talking about. I'm no high-school girl looking through a window--reaching for the moon.  Guess I'll be going.	Sally--!
4 Let's forget it--can't you see I kind of like you, too ... and I don't want to get involved.	You mean that?
5 Don't let's talk about it.	You said it! How about a little action?

1 Not here--follow me around the shed.	Don't you know better than to talk to me with people around?
2 Oh, putting on the swell, eh?	I thought you were a smart guy.
3 If I was smart I wouldn't be working my way over on this ship. 	We didn't have enough dough for two tickets, did we?
4 We coulda got two third-class!	No bank roll there, boy.  Lucky I could get you signed on--they picked up that Pittsburgh jeweler--made him talk. The heat's on, Shortie--and those Atlantic breezes are going to be mighty welcome.
5 Oh, I'm not squawkin', but I'm not used to working and it's a bad habit to get into.	It'll never hurt you---Got any money?
6 A dollar seventy and I'm gonna keep it!	No, you're not. Give me that dollar seventy.
7 I'll give you half of it.  Here's seventy cents. 

1 Shortie!--you know my motto?	Pleasure first if it don't interfere with business.
2 Right!--but it doesn't have to apply to you--Keep your eyes open for anybody wearing a lot of cracked ice and give me the office.	Now you're talkin'!

1 Hello, Jimmy. What's up?	Listen, Runt--Quick! Where's the ice?
2 Why--I--er thought with all this heat turned on I'd hide it.	Where did you hide it?
3 On the drunk.	Get it!

1 Care to join us?	No, thanks--I never gambled in my life.

1 Don't get yourself all worked up--	You keep out of this--  You admit you thought of killing him--how were you going to do it?

1 Here you are, sir. 	What'll I say?

1 Hello, Denby!	I thought I put you to bed.
2 Oh, was that me you put to bed? Thanks. I've been looking all over for you.	Well, did you find me?
3 Not yet.  Say, where is this boat headed for?	This is a fine time to be asking that. You're on your way to France.
4 That's news to me. I'd better cable my wife.

1 Hello, Inspector--I hear your vacation's been spoiled. Somebody lost a bracelet.	Yes, a bracelet's been lost, but I'm still on my vacation.
2 I understand you searched Brett for it last night. By the way--what do you know about him?	Well, I've seen him here and there. What's on your mind?
3 Oh, nothing--only I wondered why you suspected him.	Well, I'll tell you--we picked him up about a year ago-- but could never pin anything on him.
4 Maybe he just travels in bad company.	Yeah--

1 Yep--everybody's having a good time but me--What do you want, Mary?	I just wrote a poem about the Atlantic Ocean--
2 But, Mary--everybody's having such a great time-- why spoil it?	Somebody's got to do it--
3 Well, let's hear the poem--	Oh, you dear Atlantic Ocean--how you spread across the sea--From New York to dear old Europe--just for boats to ride on thee--
4 Very good, Mary--	But I'm not finished yet----And your waves are so colossal--rocking boats both to and fro--Oh-h, Atlantic, how I love you ----how I love you--
5 What's the matter, Mary?	I'm getting seasick--
6 H'mm--<U>Dear</U> Atlantic--	Mr. Denby--What do you think I ought to do with that part?
7 Put the whole thing in an envelope and mail it through a porthole--

1 That's him! That's the sucker!!	Looks lonesome--Bring him over here.

1 I know he is. You change those clothes and then come to my cabin. I'll expect you around twelve o'clock.	Not a chance--I'm through. 

1 Well, I'll be a son of a sea cook!	What's the matter?
2 Nothin--  --I just remembered the name of a guy that owes me fifty bucks.

1 Skinny lunger, your guns don't Impress me.  Wasn't for those guns You'd be nothin'.	Why Ed, what an ugly thing to Say!  Does this mean you're not my Friend anymore?  You know, Ed, if I thought you weren't my friend I Don't think I could bear it.

1 He said to turn loose of him.	Well I'm not so go home.

1 Feel bad about ol' Fred.  Just Can't hold back when I'm feelin' Woolly.  Still, feel kinda bad. But now we're square.  Anyway no Use for holdin' a grudge.  I Deserved a rap in the head.	Make you a deal.  My brother took Over the Marshal's office in Tombstone.  Got it in his head He's gonna make the place safe For widows and orphans.  You and Your boys stay out of his way, I'll make sure he stays out of yours.
2 Fair enough.  You know I got to Admit, you got a lot of bark on You comin' up here like this.	They were all gonna jump me back There.  What ever happened to one Against one?
3 Ain't our way.  We go all on one, One on all.  Fight one of us, you Fight us all.  That's the Cowboy way.	And how come you call yourselves Cowboys?  Cowhands ride for the brand.
4 Oh, we ride for a brand all right.  This brand.  How 'bout you?	This brand.
5 We're gonna get along just fine.

1 Why Johnny Ringo, you look like Somebody just walked over your grave.  Oh, I wasn't quite as sick as I Made out.	My fight's not with you, Holliday.
2 I beg to differ.  We started a Fight we never got to finish. Play for blood, remember?	I was kidding about that.

1 Since when is faro a business?	Didn't you always say gambling's An honest trade?
2 I said poker's an honest trade. Only suckers buck the tiger.  The Odds are all with the house.	Depends how you look at it.  I Mean it's not like anybody's Holding a gun to their heads.
3 That's what I love about Wyatt. He can talk himself into anything.

1 It appears he missed an excellent Chance to keep his mouth shut.	Felt his liver go on that last One.  Get him to a doctor or he'll Be dead in a couple hours.

1 You really look awful.	Not half as bad as I feel.
2 Then why in hell're you doin' This?  You ought to be in bed.	Wyatt Earp is my friend.
3 Hell, I got lot's of friends.	I don't.

1 Wyatt, I... I ain't got the words.	I know.  Me neither.

1 What is it?	Easy now... That mare's in season.
2 Oh...  Now she's starting.  How do they know?	They know.  It's the scent.  We Better split 'em up.
3 I have a better idea, let's run It out of them!

1 I have to go.	Wait!

1 That the bottle Lou gave you? Better go easy on that stuff.	I know what I'm doing.  Where have You been?
2 Out ridin'.  So... how you doin'?	I don't know.  I'm all right.
3 Really?  You sure?	Sure I'm sure.  What is this?

1 Florentino!  He's getting away!	Drop his horse.

1 Wyatt, meet Fred White, he's town marshal.	Lotta law around here.  Just met the Sheriff.

1 I just got it fixed.	You're on.

1 Allie-girl...And Louisa!  You're So lovely.  I'm at your feet, Darlin'.  Just at your feet.  Guess it's only right.  Ma always Said you were the prettiest.	But she doted on the frowner

1 Billy Clanton, Wes Fuller, and Billy Claiborne.  Now there's six Of 'em.  This is like a bad dream.	Just stay calm, use your head. It'll be all right.  Just the Same, though...  Guess you better swear me in.

1 But -	- Thank you, M. But this is more than your man can handle.  Are we in agreement?

1 Mr. Bond! Nice to see you.	Sir Elliot.
2 Come. Let's get out of the noise.  - I'll give you a tour of the building, then we'll talk.

1 I'm sure they will.	Good-bye, Mister Bond.

1 Actually, I've never known you to do either... But -	- We all want what we can't have?
2 Not all of us, 007.

1 Don't you even miss me? Didn't I mean anything to you?	Nothing.

1 Okay, Saunders. What is it this time? Rocket in the leg? Machine pistol in the arm?	Q's retirement party. I'd just put the knife into the cake, and -
2 Come on. I know better than that -

1 I think I've just seen my next future ex-wife.	Not if you kill us first - unless that's how you plan to leave Muffy.

1 Married?	Happily.
2 ... Kids?	Three. You? Married?
3 No.	I didn't think so.

1 And what do you call this?	- The family jewels?

1 Down?	Up.

1 Thank you Colonel Everhart.  007, I'd like to see you in my office. Why don't you and the Colonel exchange numbers if you need more information?	Yes, M.

1 Sorry I'm late -	Actually, you're just in time.  Admiral Roebuck: You know Commander Bond, don't you?

1 You won't get away with this!	Good-day, Miss Winch. I advise you to get some steam up - before you run aground.

1 How sweet.	My timing always was lousy.

1 - Built to withstand a nuclear blast.  Are they alive?	Yes. Shall we kill them?
2 No. I have a better idea. In fact, Mr. Bond may have actually improved my original plan.  Bring them both to Hong Kong. And Make sure he has nothing else up his sleeve.

1 Soviet SB-9 nuclear torpedo. Yield, one kiloton.	Will the cruise set it off?
2 Yes.

1 I'm leaving and don't even call me when the shoe falls 'cause all he did for me was to try and run my life. I'm tired of people saying Babe Brother this, Babe Brother that. What's my name?	You dumb ass, it's Babe Brother.
2 My name is Sam. Samuel.

1 Who is it?	Babe Brother.

1 I don't want to wear out welcome, but you can stay in someone's heart longer than you can stay in their house. Come with us, boy. We are going to have a good time.	This would be a bad time for me to leave.
2 We are going where the action is. Ain't that right, Okra?  Let's play for a couple of bucks unless you want to start off with two bits and work our way up.  What would you give to be rich?

1 I'm worn out.	Just stay in bed and rest.
2 I have to feed the chickens before they wake everybody up.	You stay inside. I will see to them.
3 I will appreciate that.

1 Man, act like this is your home.	That's awful generous of you. I always ask to keep from wearing out welcome.

1 Those days you could always find something redeeming about even the worst person.	You remember that boy who lost his mind, Joe? You could hear him pitching horseshoes at night in the dark. He wouldn't miss a one. Make him mad and call yourself running in the house to be safe. He would pick up a brick and say "go on in there brick and hit somebody" and it would find its mark.
2 I was afraid to go to Marcus Bottom because of him.	All those places that us coloreds lived, that we used to call Bottoms, have all been changed to Drives and Heights. Everything is in what you call it, not in what it is.

1 As God is my witness, I have never done anything to that woman.	You must have done something to her.
2 Since she has repented, all she does is throw stones.	Hattie is a different person now.
3 I don't make no bones about where I'm going to spend eternity. I have always been wild and you know that. If you are made to feel half a man, what do you think the other half is?	I'm glad you brought that up as to who you are. I have to know who is in my house.
4 You invited me.	Only if you are a good man, a friend. Are you a friend?

1 You know the saying, "your heart is in your left hand."	Now I was trying to be nice, to make conversation, since we go back some.
2 I was quoting from the Bible. If the shoe fits, wear it.	"Out of weariness, I spoke to my own heart; to leave it all and to die. And I gave my heart to know madness and folly."

1 You know Okra asked me to marry him the other evening.	Rush your mouth, girl. No, he didn't. He cannot be that big of a damn fool.
2 I asked Harry about it. He didn't own up to it. He said he didn't know what got into Okra.	He's just raffish. Harry put him up to it. Before evening sun sets, I would have his belongings back on Route 55, that old fox.
3 I can't accuse him just dry long 80.	Everybody who have been associated with Harry end up with pennies over their eyes.
4 What must I do?	If it was left up to me, I would poison him.

1 Come on down, guys.  It's time for games!  We've got prizes!	Oh, yeah!

1 I looked everywhere, honey, but all I could find was your hat.	But what if we leave them behind?
2 Oh, don't worry, honey, I'm sure we'll find Woody and Buzz before we leave tomorrow.

1 Say, isn't that mistletoe?	Mm-hmmmmm.

1 Don't even think about it, cowboy!	Oh, yeah, tough guy?!

1 Now you're sure this spacefreighter will return to its port of origin once it jettisons its food supply?	Uh-huh.  And when we get there, we'll be able to find a way to transport you...home.
2 Well, then let's climb abroad.

1 They're gonna eat us, Buzz!!  Do something!  Quick!	Shield your eyes!

1 Oh, come on, Buzz.  I...Buzz, I can't do this without you.  I need your help.	I can't help.  I can't help anyone.
2 Why, sure you can, Buzz.  You can get me out of here and then I'll get that rocket off you, and we'll make a break for Andy's house.	Andy's house.  Sid's house.  What's the difference.
3 Oh, Buzz, you've had a big fall. You must not be thinking clearly.	No, Woody, for the first time I am thinking clearly.  You were right all along.  I'm not a Space Ranger.  I'm just a toy.  A stupid little insignificant toy.
4 Whoa, hey -- wait a minute.  Being a toy is a lot better than being a Space Ranger.	Yeah, right.
5 No, it is.  Look, over in that house is a kid who thinks you are the greatest, and it's not because you're a Space Ranger, pal, it's because you're a TOY!  You are HIS toy.	But why would Andy want me?
6 Why would Andy want you?!  Look at you!  You're a Buzz Lightyear.  Any other toy would give up his moving parts just to be you.  You've got wings, you glow in the dark, you talk, your helmet does that -- that whoosh thing -- you are a COOL toy.

1 Ahhh!! This is the part where we blow up!	Not today!

1 Oh, boy.  Will ya take a look at all those presents?!	I can't see a thing!

1 MOM!!  MOM!!	She's lying!  Whatever she says it's not true!

1 A lunchbox?!	A lunchbox...?!

1 No wait!  You don't understand! Buzz is out there!  We've gotta help him!!	Toss 'im overboard!
2 No, no, no, wait!

1 It's Sid!	I thought he was at summer camp!

1 Buzz.  Buzz Lightyear.  You are not worried, are you?	I can't quite make out -- 

1 I'm red this time.	No, Slink --
2 Oh...well alright, you can be red if you want.	Not now, Slink.  I've got some bad news.
3 Bad news?!	Sh-h-h-h-h!!

1 You'll put your clothes here.	There's no mirror.
2 There's not.

1 I want to go home.	Home is where the heart is.
2 I can't go home because there's no home left.

1 He'll murder you when he finds out.	He'll be looking for another apprentice.
2 I hope he doesn't pick on Jonathon.	Can you move over a wee bit?

1 I'm Melanie.	You're late for breakfast.

1 Why does he need money?	He has debts.  He has gambling debts. He owes a lot of money.
2 How much?	Nine thousand dollars.

1 Even if I knew I wouldn't tell you. You do not want to come into contact with these people.  Only Carl knows who they are.  That's his real asset. Ruiz doesn't know them.  They don't know Ruiz.  Church and State.	What about legitimate businesses? We own a construction concern, real estate --
2 Laundromats for the washing of money. Unfortunately, Carl had only one successful business.	Don't you have some good news?  Isn't there something positive you could say.

1 Like a Grateful Dead Concert.	Drugs begin pouring out of America into every other country in the world. Canada is completely overwhelmed.

1 Where are you going?	She'll be at a pawn shop in an hour.

1 What's it like?  Imagine you're being accosted by a swarm of beggars in the heart of Calcutta, except the beggars are wearing $1500 suits and they don't say "please" or "thank you."	What about legalizing everything? Has anybody talked about that?
2 Fine -- legalization.  Okay, forgetting all of our international trade agreements, legalize everything today.  The Government inserts itself into all drug transactions.  The U.S. becomes a giant pharmacy.  Our borders are mobbed, lines of people from here to Europe wanting to smoke, snort and shoot themselves into oblivion.

1 Ach, that's what I'm talking about. Sarcasm.  Always fucking sarcasm. You're afraid and you think if you admit it people will think you're weak or won't like you --	We live our lives by these unspoken rules that are handed to us.

1 Are you getting this on tape?	I love my job.  I love it.  The next time I'm having a bad day you gotta remind me of right now and I'll get over it.

1 They're going to walk right past me.	What are you?  A mouse?  Get out of the car and do it.  This is your chance.

1 Yes, he threatened to kill my five year-old son.  I was under the impression I would be meeting Juan Obregon.	No, this is not possible.  And I thank you for coming down here, though I suspect it's been a pointless journey.
2 Why do you say that, Mr. Marquez?	I hear these stories.  Your husband in jail.  His business in chaos. Various people fighting over the scraps.
3 My husband is the victim of an informer in your organization, not ours.	That is not true, Mrs. Ayala.  Your route is compromised.  Perhaps it is time for me to deal with other distributors in California.
4 I don't think you're going to do that.	You don't?  Listen to this woman in a man's world, a very violent world.
5 There are plenty of other suppliers in Mexico.	But not in whose interest it is to help you out of debt.

1 Please.  Filing a report will not help you find your car.	The police won't find your car.

1 One question.  How did you find about this?	An informant.
2 What is the name of your informant?	It was an anonymous tip.

1 Who the fuck do you think you are? Where the fuck do you think you are? Why the fuck do you think I shouldn't just put you in a dumpster?	I have money --
2 I got money.	I'll pay you a thousand dollars.  I have it in my wallet.
3 I want your money, I'll take your money.	Just tell me where she is.

1 Who are these guys?	Agents who died in the field.

1 Shut you mouth or you'll be next.	You've stabbed me, man.
2 You were in my way.

1 Buy yourself that island in the sun?	For four fucking grand?  One palm tree, a couple of rocks, and a sewage outflow.

1 You're not getting any younger, Mark. The world is changing, music is changing, even drugs are changing. You can't stay in here all day dreaming about heroin and Ziggy Pop.	It's Iggy Pop.
2 Whatever. I mean, the guy's dead anyway.	Iggy Pop is not dead. He toured last year. Tommy went to see him.
3 The point is, you've got to find something new.

1 Thank you, Mr. Murphy. We'll let you know.	The pleasure was mine. Best interview I've ever been to. Thanks.

1 Who wrote it?	But you're looking better, it has to be said. Healthier. Radiant even.
2 You don't know, do you?	And I wondered if you'd care to go to the park tomorrow.
3 The park?	Tomorrow afternoon. Usual set-up.
4 Who wrote it?	Roald Dahl.
5 Roald Dahl. Fuck me.

1 What?	There's a mate of swanney's. Mikey Forrester -- you know the guy. He's come into some gear. A lot of gear.
2 How much?	About four kilos. So he tells me. Got drunk in a pub down by the docks last week, where he met two Russian sailors. They're fucking carrying the stuff. For sale there and then, like. So he wakes up the next morning, realizes what he's done and get very fucking nervous. Wants rid of this. {---------- He's looking for Swanney to punt it, but Swanney's nowhere to be seen since he lost his leg. ---------- }
3 So?	So he met me and I offered to take it off his hands at a very reasonable price, with the intention of punting it on myself to a guy I know in London.
4 So we've just come from Tommy's funeral and you're telling me about a skag deal?

1 How's it going with Gail?	No joy yet.
2 How long is it?	Six weeks.
3 Six weeks!	It's a nightmare. She told me she didn't want our relationship to start on a physical basis as that is how it would be principally defined from then on in.
4 Where did she come up with that?	She read it in Cosmopolitan.
5 Six weeks and no sex?	I've got balls like watermelons, I'm telling you.

1 Bad news, gentlemen. Shore leave's been cancelled.	Rescued at last.
2 Return to prearranged coordinates for pickup.

1 What's Emergency Landing Plan B?	I don't have a clue.

1 You told me you could have the ship operational  in two weeks. I gave you three. What Happened?	I think you gave me too much time, Captain.
2 Very well, Mr. Scott. Carry on.	Aye, Captain  How many times do I have to tell you? The right tool for the right job...

1 Bird of Prey bearing one zero five mark two.	Go, Sulu.

1 "Row, row, row your boat..." I love "Row..."  Do - do you know "Row, Row, Row, Row, Row Your Boat?"	That song did not come up in my research, Captain.
2 The lyrics are - are very simple. It's, er, "Row, row, row your boat, gently down the stream. Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, life is but a dream.." The Doctor and I will start it off, and then when we give you the signal, you jump in.  Doctor, if you please.

1 When he encouraged others to follow him, he was banished from Vulcan, never to return.	Fascinating.

1 Exactly. That is correct. Sybok's mother was a Vulcan princess. Upon her death, Sybok and I were raised as brothers.	Why didn't you tell me this before?
2 I was not disposed to discuss... matters of a personal nature. For that, I'm sorry.	He's sorry, See, he's sorry. Everything... that makes everything all right. He's sorry, everything's...

1 Spock.	The emergency channel, open.
2 To anyone within the sound of my voice: This is Captain James T. Kirk of the Federation Starship Enterprise. If you read me, acknowledge. Acknowledge.

1 What are you doing?	In order to lower and raise the shields as quickly as possible, we're going to forego the tractor beam and fly her in manually.

1 	

1 I am a Starfleet Officer.	Of course. Of course. Then I'll take the ship without your help.

1 Not if my Tron program was running. That would seal the system off. If your file's in there...	Boy, if we were inside, I know how to forge us a Group 6 access...

1 Flynn!	Uh, no ... I mean, not that often -

1 Way to go! We're haulin'!	Yes, okay, exactement!

1 Yes?	I... have come to communicate with my User.
2 Hmm. A difficult proposition... difficult proposition at best.  Perhaps you've noticed... we're not exactly packing them in these days ...

1 Flynn...  Where's Ram?	I'm sorry, Tron... he's... he didn't make it.

1 There's another beam!	It's too far!

1 Watch it!	Recognizers!

1 Don't even say that. You've got to find that file before he does..	Not much chance of that now. The MCP can just slip it into another system as soon as it locates it...

1 I hope you've enjoyed being a command program, Sark. I wonder how you'll like working in a pocket calculator... maybe one of those watches that plays "Happy Birthday" to its User once a year.	Now, sir... We did take care of that User you sent us --
2 Yes, and now you've got two renegade programs running all the hell over the system in a stolen simulation.	We'll get them, sir... These things take time.
3 I don't have time, Sark. And neither do you. End of line.

1 This is Flynn... the one who busted me out.	Then I owe you some thanks...

1 I'm done.	Where are you off to young lady?
2 I have a book report.

1 Faisil.  You're new on Harry's team, aren't you?	Yes.
2 So what makes you think that the slack I cut him in any way translates to you?!	Sorry, sir.  Uh... here's what we got.

1 See, kids now are ten years ahead    * of where we were at the same age. You probably think she's still a virgin--	Don't be ridiculous.  She's only -- how old is she?
2 Fourteen, Harry.	Right.  She's only fourteen.

1 Station wagon?	Uh huh.  Want me to lose them?

1 Look, uh... I've got to talk to Helen about this thing with Dana. I'm just going to run in and see if she can get away for lunch.	You want me to just hang-- ?
2 Just hang a minute.	I'll just hang then, shall I?

1 She could be telling the truth.	Wait!  Calm down, Mrs. Tasker. There is only one more question.

1 He's got it.	Sorry.

1 Let's see... that you can read ancient Sanskrit without having to sound out the words.  And that other dealers and archeologists don't like you much.	Those wimps.  It's because I use    * my diplomatic contacts to export cultural treasures from countries which tell them to take a hike.  I told you to move those crates an hour ago.  Come on guys, let's get going.

1 How'd it go at the trade show? You make all the other salesmen jealous?	Yeah.  You should have seen it. We were the hit of the show with the new model ordering system, the one for the 680... how you can write up an order and the second the customer's name goes into the computer, it starts checking their credit, and if they've ordered anything in the past, and if they get a discount...

1 I was in the area, and I thought you might like to have lunch.	They must've just missed me.
2 They said you had to run out.	Yeah.  It was a rush thing.  They needed some documents down at the court house.  I barely made it.

1 This Simon.  Did you sleep with him?	No.

1 I'm sorry, honey.	Don't call me honey!  You don't ever get to call me honey again. You understand?!  You pig!

1 What're we talking about here? Pussy, right?	Absolutely.

1 I said SIT DOWN.  Who do you work for?	Kettleman, Barnes and McGrath. I'm a legal secretary.
2 Of course.  Mrs. Tasker.  And what were you going with the international terrorist, Carlos the Jackal?  Taking dictation?	He said he was an American agent.

1 Are you sure you weren't followed?	I kept looking back, like you taught me.  I didn't see anyone.
2 Okay.  It's just, things are a bit hot for me right now.  If I get a signal...  I may have to leave suddenly.	I understand.
3 It's my job to risk my life, but not yours.  I feel bad about bringing you into this, but you're the only one I can trust.

1 Thank you.  You saved my life. What's your name?	Helen.
2 You can call me Simon.  You're very brave to do this...  You opened it.	I just glances inside.

1 You're gonna be on "T.J. Hooker"?	Knock wood.

1 The letter I sent.	The letter he sent.

1 Well, enough about the King. How about you?	How 'bout me what?
2 Tell me about yourself.	There's nothing to tell.
3 C'mon. What're ya tryin' to be? The Phantom Lady?	What do you want to know?
4 Well, for starters, what do you do? Where're ya from? What's your favorite color? Who's your favorite movie star? What kinda music do you like? What are your turn-ons and turn-offs? Do you have a fella? What's the story behind you takin' a cab to the most dangerous part of town alone? And, in a theater full of empty seats, why did you sit by me?

1 You know when you sat behind me?	At the movies?
2 Uh-huh, I was tryin' to think of somethin' to say to you, then I thought, she doesn't want me bothering her.	What would make you think that?
3 I dunno. I guess I'm just stupid.	You're not stupid. Just wrong.

1 Where you goin', honey?	I just gotta get somethin'.

1 It's been fun thinking about the money but I can walk away from it, honey.	That rhymes.

1 Clarence, I gotta hand it to ya. You were cooler than cool.	I was dying. I thought for sure everyone could see it on my face.
2 All anybody saw was Clint Eastwood drinkin' coffee.	Can you develop an ulcer in two minutes? Being cool is hard on your body.
3 Oh, and your line to Charles Atlas in there: "I'll take that gun", "You'll have to".	That was cool, wasn't it? You know, I don't even know where that came from. I just opened my mouth and it came out. After I said it I thought, that's a cool line, I gotta remember that.

1 Money problems?	Now tell him goodbye.

1 Yeah, well if we got lost, it's your ass.  Come on, Clarence, lets go. Elliot's going to meet us in the lobby.	I'm just makin' sure we got everything.  You got yours?

1 Well, enough about the King, how 'bout you?	How 'bout me what?
2 How 'bout you go to the movies with me tonight?	What are we gonna see?
3 A Donny Chiba triple feature. "The Streetfighter", "Return of the Streetfighter", and "Sister Streetfighter".	Who's Sonny Chiba?
4 He is, bar none, the greatest actor working in martial arts movies ever.	You wanna take me to a kung fu movie?
5 Three kung fu movies.

1 Elliot.	Yeah?
2 Get on your knees.

1 Now, that's practically uncut. You could, if you so desire, cut it a helluva lot more.	Don't worry, I'll desire. Boris, could I have some more coffee.
2 Me too, Boris.

1 What do you want from me?	What?
2 Stop acting like an infant. You're here because you want me to help you in some way. What do you need from me? You need money?	Do you still have friends on the force?
3 Yes, I still have friends on the force.	Could you find out if they know anythin'? I don't know they know shit about us. But I don't wanna think, I wanna know. You could find out for sure what's goin' on.  Daddy?
4 What makes you think I could do that?	You were a cop.
5 What makes you think I would do that?	I'm your son.
6 You got it all worked out, don't you?	Look, goddamnit, I never asked you for a goddamn thing! I've tried to make your parental obligation as easy as possible. After Mom divorced you, did I ask you for anything? When I wouldn't see ya for six months to a year at a time, did you ever get your shit about it? No, it was always "OK", "No problem", "You're a busy guy, I understand". The whole time you were a drunk, did I ever point my finger at you and talk shit? No! Everybody else did. I never did. You see, I know that you're just a bad parent. You're not really very good at it. But I know you love me. I'm basically a pretty resourceful guy. If I didn't really need it I wouldn't ask. And if you say no, don't worry about it. I'm gone. No problems.

1 Well, the part you're reading for is one of the bad guys. There's Brian and Marty. Peter Breck's already been cast as Brian. And you're reading for the part of Marty. Now in this scene you're both in a car and Bill Shatner's hanging on the hood.  And what you're trying to do is get him off.  Whenever you're ready.	Where'd you come from?
2 I don't know. He just appeared as magic.	Well, don't just sit there, shoot him.

1 He's so spooked he'd turn over his momma, his daddy, his two-panny granny, and Anna and the King of Siam if he had anything on him.	This rabbit'll do anything not to do time, including wearing a wire.

1 You see what you get when you fuck wit me, white boy? You're gonna walk in my goddamn house, my house! Gonna come in here and tell me! Talkin' smack, in my house, in front of my employees. Shit! Your ass must be crazy.  I don't think that white boy's got good sense. Hey, Marty.  He must of thought it was white boy day. It ain't white boy day, is it?	Naw, man, it ain't white boy day.
2 Shit, man, you done fucked up again. Next time you bogart your way into a nigger's crib, an' get all his face, make sure you do it on white boy day.

1 Hello, is Dick Ritchie here?	Naw, he ain't home right now.
2 Do you live here?	Yeah, I live here.
3 Sorta room-mates?	Exactly room-mates.
4 Maybe you can help me. Actually, who I'm looking for is a friend of ours from Detroit. Clarence Worley? I heard he was in town. Might be travelling with a pretty girl named Alabama. Have you seen him? Are they stayin' here?	Naw, they ain't stayin' here. But, I know who you're talkin' about. They're stayin' at the Hollywood Holiday Inn.
5 How do you know? You been there?	No, I ain't been there. But I heard him say. Hollywood Holiday Inn. Kinda easy to remember.
6 You're right. It is.

1 The food, the sky, the certain, uh, sexual temptations -- you haven't become "addicted" have you, Cole?  To that "dying" world'	No, sir!  I just want to do my part. To get us back on top...in charge of the planet.  And I have the experience, I know who the people are...

1 It's the kidnap woman -- the one who was with the guy who tied us up.	What's she doing?
2 She's drawing attention to us, that's what she's doing. ... I don't know what you're up to this time, Mason, but you're gonna get us in deep shit!

1 Cole!  James Cole!  You escaped from a locked room six years ago.	1989.  Six years for you.  There's the sign!  Right here!

1 They're keeping an eye on me.	Who's keeping an eye on you?
2 The man...with the voice.  I recognized him.  He's from the present.  He...

1 You smell so good.	You have to give yourself up, you know.

1 It's a Carpet Cleaning Company...	A Carpet Cleaning Company?
2 No superiors!  No scientists.  No people from the future.  It's just a Carpet Cleaning Company.  They have voice mail -- you leave a message telling them when you want your carpet cleaned.	You... you left them a message?
3 I couldn't resist.  I was so relieved. Wait'll they hear this nutty woman telling them...they better watch out for the Army of the Twelve Monkeys...

1 What'd they give you?  Thorazine?  How much?  Learn your drugs -- know your doses.	I need to make a telephone call.
2 A telephone call?  That's communication with the outside world!  Doctor's discretion.  Hey, if alla these nuts could just make phone calls, it could spread.  Insanity oozing through telephone cables, oozing into the ears of all those poor sane people, infecting them!  Whackos everywhere!  A plague of madness.  In fact, very few of us here are actually mentally ill.  I'm not saying you're not mentally ill, for all I know you're crazy as a loon.  But that's not why you're here.  Why you're here is because of the system, because of the economy.  There's the TV.  It's all right there. Commercials.  We are not productive anymore, they don't need us to make things anymore, it's all automated.  What are we for then?  We're consumers.  Okay, buy a lot of stuff, you're a good citizen. But if you don't buy a lot of stuff, you know what?  You're mentally ill! That's a fact!  If you don't buy things...toilet paper, new cars, computerized blenders, electrically operated sexual devices...  SCREWDRIVERS WITH MINIATURE BUILT-IN RADAR DEVICES, STEREO SYSTEMS WITH BRAIN IMPLANTED HEADPHONES, VOICE- ACTIVATED COMPUTERS, AND...

1 I don't have time to go upstairs.  The police are looking for me.  I need to know where it is and exactly what it is.	I get it!  This is your old plan, right?
2 Plan?  What are you talking about?	Remember?  We were in the dayroom, watching TV, and you were all upset about the...desecration of the planet. And you said to me, "Wouldn't it be great if there was a germ or a virus that could wipe out mankind and leave the plants and animals just as they are?"  You do remember that, don't you?
3 Bulishit!  You're fucking with my head!	And that's when I told you my father was this famous virologist and you said, "Hey, he could make a germ and we could steal it!"
4 Listen, you dumb fuck!  The thing mutates We live underground!  The world belongs to the fucking dogs and cats.  We're like moles or worms.  All we want to do is study the original...

1 He was fully sedated!	Then are you trying to tell me that a fully sedated, fully restrained patient somehow slipped out that vent, replaced the grill behind him and that he's wriggling through the ventilation system right now?

1 Hey!  You there!	You want something, old man?
2 Don't call me old man.  Ain't you got no respect, boy?	You want something?
3 Yeah I want something.  I want you to run over to that machine and get me a pop.	You can't do that yourself?
4 Hell no, I can't do that myself. I'm blind.  Can't you see that?	I'm sorry, I didn't--
5 What'd you think I was doing out here with these glasses on?  Sunnin' myself?	I don't know.  I thought you were keeping the sun from your eyes.
6 I ain't got no eyes.  You want to see?	Christ no!
7 Lost my eyes on Okinawa.  Lost them fighting the war.  Fought the war and lost my eyes just so you could come around here and make fun of me.	I said I was sorry.
8 Don't be sorry.  Just run over there and get me my pop before I die of thirst.	Yeah, sure.  You got change?
9 Change?  You want my change?  I fought the war and lost my eyes just so I could give you my change?	All right, old man.  Christ.

1 It's a Movado.	Never heard of it.  It's got no day or date.  Hell, it ain't even got numbers.  What's the matter?  You couldn't afford a Timex?
2 Next city you're in take it to a jeweler.  He won't give you less than four-hundred for it.

1 You want somethin'?	You Harlin?
2 Nope.  Darrell.	Harlin around?
3 He's up at the Look Out.

1 Hey there.  I was beginnin' to think you wasn't comin' back.  You don't look so good.	Yeah, well, I've been around the bend a bit.
2 One of those days you feel like you been runnin' in circles and you ain't no closer to where you tryin' to get than when you started?	You've been there?
3 Hell, I've had days I would gladly trade with a whippin' dog.  Ain't much you can do when you feel like that 'cept tough it out.	You believe that?
4 You think bad, and bad is what you get.	That's a good piece of advice, Darrell.
5 No charge.	Listen, Darrell, about that hundred- fifty bucks for the car, as soon as I get where I'm going I swear I'll--
6 Two-hundred.	What?
7 It's going to cost you two-hundred dollars.	You said this morning the hose was going to run me one-fifty.
8 Yep.  For the hose.  But while you was gone I replaced a gasket. That's going to run you another fifty.	I didn't tell you to replace any gasket.
9 Yeah, but it was shot.	I didn't tell you to do it!  You can't just do unauthorized work.
10 Well, now, you just know all there is about bein' a mechanic, don't you?  I can't do unauthorized work. I suppose I can just let you ride out of here with a bad gasket.  Then you get in an accident and get killed.  Or worse.  Who they gonna blame then?  They gonna blame me, and there goes my reputation.	What reputation?  You're nothing but an ignorant, inbred, tumble weed hick.
11 Is that an insult?  Are you insulting me.	Listen you stupid fuck, I want my car.
12 Take it.  As soon as I get my money. Fifty dollars for an almost new gasket.  You don't know what kind of a deal you're getting.	I'm taking my car, and I'm taking it now!
13 You listen to me, you fancy city man.  You owe me money, and this car ain't going nowheres until I get it. And if you take another five hours I'll find another fifty dollars worth of work to do on her.  Now get out of here!  You're stinking up my garage.

1 Lord!  Put the baby in the icebox. Killed the poor thing.	Baby didn't die.  Just froze off all it's finger and toes.  Just a little fingerless, toeless boy now.  But the husband; he sees what the wife's done, so after he saves the baby he locks the wife in the refrigerator to see how she likes it.  Now she died.

1 Jake.  I thought you would be at work, dear.	Who the hell is this!?

1 Jesus.	You sure you can manage?
2 I got it.	Do you want me to carry your pack for you?

1 My face tell you all that?	It tells me what every face tells me.  Everybody has a past, they have a pain, and they have something they want.  What is it you want?
2 The same thing you do.

1 How far is it to California?	From here?  I don't know.  Far.  Far enough.
2 Have you ever been there before?	Yeah.
3 Is it pretty?	Beautiful.  Beautiful beaches.  Blue water and clear skies as far as you can see.
4 Take me with you.	I can't.
5 Please.  I won't hang on you.  As soon as we get there you can dump me.  I don't care.  I just want to get out of here.	Grace, I can't.  I can't even get out of here myself.  I need a hundred-fifty bucks to get my car back from that crazy mechanic.
6 I know where we could get the money. A lot more than one-hundred-fifty dollars.	Where?
7 Jake.	You think Jake's going to give me money just so I can take you out of here?
8 He doesn't give it to us.  We take it.	From?
9 He's got money.  In a floor safe in the living room.  I've never seen it, but he talks about it all the time.  More like brags.  He loves his money.  Wouldn't think of spending some of it on me.	You live pretty good.
10 Yeah, a bird in a gilded cage.	How much money has he got?
11 Near as I can figure must be about a hundred-thousand.	One-hundred-thousand!?  That son-of- a-bitch lied to me.
12 Lied?  What do you mean?	I . . . nothing.  Just something he said.  So if the money's in a safe we'd have to get the combination--
13 It's not a combination lock.  It takes a key.  He keeps it on him all the time.  I mean all the time.  It scratches up against me when we do it.	If the key's on him, to get the key we'd have to . . .
14 We'd have to kill him.

1 If you want.	We're going all the way.  Together.

1 You're crazy, you know that!? You're fucked up!?	Just drive.

1 Who the hell are you?	I'm her husband.
2 Husband . . .?	Now who the hell are you, and it better be good, or God help me I'll break you in half.
3 I . . I was helping your wife.  I met her in town.  She needed a hand with her drapes.  That's all.	Didn't much look like you were hanging drapes.
4 I swear to you that's all that happened.  I haven't so much as set foot in your bedroom.	A lot that means.
5 Grace, tell him.

1 Nice office you've got.	I do all right.  Real estate isn't a bad game such as it is around here. The trick is to underestimate the price when you buy it, and overvalue when you sell.  You can turn a few dollars that way.
2 Isn't that illegal?

1 Yeah, well, me too.	Trouble with the car again?
2 You could say.  I don't even have it yet.	Darrell giving you problems?
3 He did more work on the car.  He wants fifty bucks extra for it.	Fifty dollars more.  That's a lot of money when you don't have a dime. And where'd you plan on getting the money from?  Maybe you thought you'd pay your friend Jake McKenna a visit.
4 It's not like that.	Maybe you heard old Jake's got some money stashed away and you thought you'd help yourself to a little.
5 Wait a minute.  Just listen to me--	You thought you'd come in here in the middle of the night and wham! Wail off and clock old Jake McKenna and turn his brains into wall paper.
6 Jake--	And then with Jake out of the way you could borrow two-hundred dollars.  Or maybe two-thousand.  Or twenty-thousand.  Who's to stop you? Not Jake McKenna, 'cause old Jake would be dead.
7 That's not the reason I'm here.  I swear it.	There's another reason?  It better be good.
8 I came for Grace.	You came to take my wife from me?
9 I came to kill her.	Liar.
10 It's the truth, Jake.	That's a thick change of heart.
11 Yeah, well, a couple of hours ago I just about killed some guy over a girl.  Not for money, for a girl. And she was just going to stand there and let it happen, or let him kill me.  Same way Grace played us this morning.  I don't like that, Jake.  Not twice in one day.  And maybe I'm so pissed I'd twist the next off my own Grandma to get out of here.	That's a lot of talk.  A whole lot of talk.
12 Damn it, Jake.  If I don't get out of here some guys are going to come gunning for me.  And if it comes down to me or Grace, then I pick Grace.  You were going to give me thirteen-thousand.  Give me two- hundred.  I'll kill her and dump the body where no one will ever find it. But I need the money.  I've got to have the money.

1 Hey, Mister.  Mister.  I just. . . I just wanted to thank you.	For what?
2 For defending my honor this afternoon.	I hate to bust your bubble, but I wasn't defending you.
3 But you was going to fight for me.	I wasn't going to fight for you.  I was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend.
4 He's not my boyfriend.  I mean, I let him take me out and stuff, but I ain't spoken for.  Not yet that is.	Get it through your head, little girl; I'm not going for you.  If this Toby likes you, then if I were you I'd marry him.  You're not going to get much better in this town.
5 That's what I thought until you came riding in.  I saw your car over at the gas station.  It's cool.  Want to take me for a ride?  Desert's kind of lonely this time of day.	How old are you?
6 Eighteen.  Well, I'm gonna be eighteen in two years, but that don't mean you can't take me for a ride if you want.	No, I don't want to take you for a ride.  What I want is for . . . Hey, you don't happen to have a hundred and fifty dollars I could--

1 Get up, Mister!  Don't ever let it be said Toby Tyler beat the living shit out of someone without giving them a fair chance.	What the hell are you doing?  Are you crazy?
2 I'm doing what any man would do if he'd been offended.  I'm beating you up.	You stupid punk!  You don't even know what you're fighting over!
3 My honor, that's what I'm fighting over.  Now get up off the ground, or do I have to whoop you where you lie?

1 Nice night for a drive.  Morning really.  I guess that's about the only way to keep cool; riding around with the top down on a fancy convertible in the first hours of the day.	Not taking a drive, Sheriff. Heading out of town.
2 Suppose you've had all you can of Sierra.  What with that ruckus you had with Toby.  Oh yes, I heard all about that.	Sheriff, he didn't give me any choice.  If I hadn't defended myself- -
3 Just cool down, son.  I ain't accusing you of anything.  Serves Toby right to get his ass whooped. If you hadn't done it, somebody else would've.	Is there a problem up the road, Sheriff?
4 Nope.  No problems up the road.

1 Hey!  You there!	You want something, old man?
2 Don't call me old man.  Ain't you got no respect, boy?	You want something?
3 Yeah I want something.  I want you to run over to that machine and get me a pop.	You can't do that yourself?
4 Hell no, I can't do that myself.  I'm blind.  Can't you see that?	I'm sorry, I didn't--
5 What'd you think I was doing out here with these glasses on?  Sunnin' myself?	I don't know.  I thought you were keeping the sun out of your eyes.
6 I ain't got no eyes.  You want to see?	Christ no!
7 Lost my eyes in Vyee-et-nam.  Lost them fighting the commies.  Fought the war and lost my eyes fightin' the commies just so you can come around here and make fun of me.	I said I was sorry.
8 Don't be sorry.  Just run over there and get me my pop before I die of thirst.	Yeah, sure.  You got change?
9 Change?  You want my change?  I fought the war and lost my eyes just so I could give you my change?	All right, old man.  Christ.

1 Time's up. Any last words of wisdom?	Things ain't always the way they seem. You got to ask yourself: is it worth it? Day comes Earthmaker is going to look in your fucking heart! Then you better know what it is you're doing. <u>Are you a human being</u> -- or just one of them hungry ghosts out there floatin' around?

1 Who the hell is this!?	Who the hell are you?
2 I'm her husband.

1 I've done a few things but I'm not a murderer, Mr. McKenna.	How do you know if you've never tried?
2 This is a joke, right?  You just want to rattle me.  Right?

1 That's my gun... That fucking Darrell!	I like Darrell.  He may be an idiot, but he's my half brother. We own Harlin's together, yeah, that little redneck manages to get paid no matter how things work out.

1 Hey mister. Mister, I just... I just wanted to thank you.	For what?
2 For defending my honor this afternoon.	I hate to bust your bubble honey, but I wasn't defending you.
3 But you was going to fight for me.	I wasn't going to fight for you.  I was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend.
4 He's not my boyfriend.  I mean, I let him take me out and stuff, but I ain't spoken for.  Not yet that is.	Get it through your head, little girl; I'm not going for you.  If this Toby likes you, then if I were you I'd marry him.  You're not going to get much better in this town.
5 That's what I thought until you came riding in.  I saw your car over at the gas station.  It's a cool car.  Want to take me for a ride?  Desert's kind of lonely this time of day.	How old are you?
6 Eighteen... Well, I'm gonna be eighteen in two years, but that don't mean you can't take me for a ride if you want.	No, I don't want to take you for a ride. What I want is for ... Hey, you don't think you can get $150 from your parents, could you?

1 Accident.	You got to be more careful. Hands is important.  Let me show you something. When I was a kid, now I don't know if you can still see it, but I gashed my fingers in a lawnmower.
2 I'm very interested in this but is there someplace...	Diner up a piece.  Not much, but us simple folk like it.
3 I'll be back in a couple of hours.  And be careful with her, will you?

1 What you want?	Open up!
2 We're closed.  Come back when the sun comes up.

1 It's very nice of you to help me.  That package is kind of heavy, and it's so hot.	No trouble at all, really.

1 I like them.  I was sick of looking at this room.  I think they add a little life.	Nothing like a little liveliness.

1 You mean the Shaman?	He <u>was</u> a Shaman...in the mine. We had nothin' after he died. Jake took us in, gave us a little money. He used to call me his "little halfbreed"... He kept Mom on the side y'know, cause he was married someplace else. He had kids in Phoenix I think, no one knew him around here...but the thing was...you see...  ...he was raping me the whole time...for years. He loved to do things to me. Believe it or not, he used to say he was in love with my ass. Y'ever been in love with a woman's ass?

1 Are you sure?...  About me, I mean?	I came back for you; this morning I came back.  Before I even knew about the money. You're what I want.  The only reason I stormed off is because you spooked me talking about Jake.  But I've had nothing but time to think about it.  It keeps coming back to you and me and us getting the hell out of here.  But we've got to get the money, baby.  We get the money, I get the car, then we get the hell out.
2 You said you couldn't kill anybody.	We don't have to kill him.  Just knock him out and tie him up 'till we get away.  It was your idea, remember?  I'm doing this for you.  I'm doing this so you can fly...fly like a bird.

1 No Grace, my hand's bothering me.	You think now that Jake's dead, there's all that money there and I don't need you anymore, and I might just sneak up behind you sometime and...pop!

1 <u>Jake</u>...	He <u>can't</u> help you now, honey!

1 Twenty-seven, fifty.  That's all I got.	The ticket is 30.55.

1 You fuck this guy -- get him to do your dirty work and you think you can take the money and dump me?	No baby, you got it wrong.
2 This road don't go to Globe, Grace -- where were you going to meet me?

1 Help me, Grace, help...	Like you helped her, Jake?

1 Proceed.	Ask if he can check how many sick days I've taken since I've worked here?

1 Is that what you wanted to ask me?	Yes.
2 Is there anything else you wanted to ask me while I'm up?... When was the last time you wore pink? When was the last time you drank soup standing up? Final call for strange questions at two in the morning.	No that's it.

1 He didn't do anything. He just told me his theory... It's sad when patients get like that. They loose reality.	Jeremy what the hell are you doing?

1 I assumed because of the train.	You assumed wrong.

1 I thought he was carrying something.	But not a knife?
2 I got this picture of a silver handled gun tucked in his pants.  Like on t.v.

1 He's doing well today.	I'm very proud of him.  He's been through a lot in his life. A lot of ups and downs, a lot of bad spells. A couple I'd thought had broken him... I mean emotionally.  They were bad... But he made it. Yes he did.
2 He's kind of a miracle.	Yes he is.

1 How much did you take off?	I lied.

1 You like sports?	It's my field. I represent athletes. I'm an agent.
2 What a coincidence? I'm a male synchronized swimmer and I'm looking for representation.	Is that right?
3 But I'm afraid of water, so that's been holding my career back a little bit.

1 Now you're going to have to tell me more.	...See my husband was a big football star in college and we were in an accident together. Our car flipped on an icy road. We were both injured. He couldn't play football anymore.  If that hadn't happened, we wouldn't have been together.
2 How so?	Football wasn't the kind of life I wanted... For ten years I'd be by the phone waiting for a call telling me he broke his neck in a practice game. And if it wasn't that call, it would be a call telling me he blew out his knee or suffered his third concussion. I've seen way too much of it in my job... I can barely take it when my clients are in pain.  I don't hate the game. I admire the amount of skill it involved and, like everyone else, I was in awe of how he could play it, but I couldn't give him my heart and then have something happen to him. And it always does with that game.  It's not a thing many people would understand.
3 You and my mother would have a special connection.	Any way, fate stepped in and took football out of the equation.
4 ...And everyone lived happily ever after.

1 You just kicked the shit out of a innocent man, you big asshole.	Innocent of what?

1 We never seen him up against any... like these ones... killers.	Little Bill come out of Kansas an' Texas, boys. He worked them tough towns.
2 Just wondered. Anybody could be scared.

1 I didn't mean... with me. Alice and Silky, they'll give you one... if you want.	I... I guess not.  I didn't mean I didn't want one 'cause of you bein' cut up. I didn't mean that.

1 Shut up, Alice. Little Bill, a whippin' ain't gonna settle this.	No?
2 This here's a lawful contract... betwixt me an' Delilah Fitzgerald, the cut-whore. Now I brung her clear from Boston, paid her expenses an' all, an' I got a contract which represents an investment of capital.	Property.
3 Damaged property. Like if I was to hamstring one of their cow ponies.	You figure nobody'll want to fuck her.
4 Hell no. Leastways, they won't pay to do it.

1 You work for the railroads too, Mister Beauchamp?	N-no. I wr-wr-wr-write... I wr- wrwrite...
2 Letters?

1 "Well, Jim," I says, "it makes me sick to see a man struttin' around and packin' two pistols an' a Henry rifle and cryin' like a baby."	Did you... kill him?
2 No,... but I can't abide them kind... an' you will find a lot of them in the saloons... tramps an' drunk teamsters an' crazy miners... sportin' pistols like they was bad men, but not having no sand nor character... not even bad character.

1 He said that, huh?	I'm a damn killer myself, only I ain't killed so many as you because of my youth. Schofield Kid, they call me.
2 Schofield? You from Schofield?	On account of my Schofield model Smith and Wesson pistol.
3 Oh.	Well, how about it?
4 About what?	Bein' my partner. I'm headin' North up around the Niobrara in Nebraska. Gonna kill a couple of no good cowboys.
5 What for?	For cuttin' up a lady. They cut up her face an' cut her eyes out, cut her ears off an' her tits too.
6 Jesus!	Thousand dollars of reward. Five hundred a piece.

1 Get some sleep, Kid.	You boys are crotchety as a couple of hens.

1 It's gonna get riper yet.	You still think he's in there?
2 Yeah, he's in there.	Well, he's holding on to his shit like it was money.
3 He's in there.	Tell me right off if you see him.
4 Yup.	You... you ain't gonna shoot him yourownself?
5 You can shoot him.

1 I trust you, Bill.	Well, you don't wanna trust me too much. We'll take Ned his share together so you don't figure I run off with it.

1 Three ways?	Yup. You still got the Spencer rifle?
2 Yeah, an' I could still hit a bird in the eye flyin'.

1 Jesus.	Fifty yards ain't bad.  Guess we better get along.

1 Me an' the Kid, we'll head over to the ranch an' as soon as we find him, we'll shoot him. Then we'll come back an' the three of us pick up the money an' head South together.	Supposin' he don't go to the ranch?
2 I'll bet anything he won't go to town nor he won't ride out on the range. Right off he'll hole up at the ranch.	I ain't waitin', Bill.  I'll look in on your youngsters when I get back.
3 Ned, don't pay no mind to what the Kid said about the money. I'll bring your share along, hear? The Kid's full of shit, hear?

1 Clouds, Kid. We was lookin' at them clouds on account of we got a storm ridin' up our ass.	Oh, them.  Hell, I seen them.

1 Jack. What are you doing here?	I've been looking all over for you. You still after the coke that walked out of that blood bath in the harbor?
2 Yeah.	You can stop looking. There was no coke. I've been in L.A. county with a guy they

1 ...and the desk Sergeant is actually trying to tell me he can't release you? Can you believe that? You weren't even charged. New York police - Jesus. I want to take pictures of your face to bring to the D.A. first thing in the morning.	Just forget about it.

1 How many times have you been in a line- up? It's always you and four dummies. The P.D. pays homeless guys ten bucks a head half the time. No way they'd line five felons in the same row. No way. And what the hell is a voice line-.up? A public defender could get you off of that.	So why the hell was I hauled in and cavity searched tonight?
2 It was the Feds. A truck load of guns gets snagged, Customs comes down on N.Y.P.D. for some answers - they come up with us. They're grabbing at straws. It's politics - nothing you can do.	I had a guy's fingers in my asshole tonight.

1 He's alright.	How do I know that? How about it, pretzel-man? What's your story?
2 His name is Verbal Kint. I thought you guys knew him.

1 What the hell do you want?	I wanted to talk to you. The other guys -
2 I did you a favor by standing up for you last night, but don't think we're friends. I'm sorry, but I have other things -	They're gonna do a job. Three million dollars, maybe more.

1 We'll make it.	Don't do this. Send her a card - something.
2 We'll make it.

1 You set up the line-up.	Mr. Soze made a few calls, yes. You were not to be released until I came to see you. It seems Mr. Keaton's attorney, Ms. Finneran, was a bit too effective in expediting his release. Holding the rest of you became a moot point.
2 What about Redfoot?	Mr. Redfoot knew nothing. Mr. Soze rarely                 t works with the same people for very long, and they never know who they're working for. One cannot be betrayed if one has no people.

1 Get a grip. I didn't know.	You didn't know.

1 His name was Arturo Marquez. A petty smuggler out of Argentina. He was arrested in New York last year for trafficking. He escaped to California and got picked up in Long Beach. They were setting up his extradition when he escaped again. Get this - Edie Finneran was called in to advise the proceedings.	Kobayashi.

1 You keep trying to lay this whole ride on                 t Keaton. It wasn't like that. Sure he knew, but Edie had him all turned around.                 r I'm telling you straight, I swear.                        +	Let me tell you something. I know Dean Keaton. I've been investigating him for three years. The guy I know is a cold-                    + blooded bastard. L.A.P.D. indicted him on three counts of murder before he was kicked off the force, so don't sell me the hooker with the heart of gold.                        +
2 You got him wrong.	Do I? Keaton was under indictment a total                 + of seven times when he was on the force.                  + In every case, witnesses either reversed                  + their testimony to the grand jury or died                 + before they could testify. When they                      t finally did nail him for fraud, he spent                  + five years in Sing Sing. He killed three prisoners inside - one with a knife in the tailbone while he strangled him to death. Of course I can't prove this but I can't prove the best part either.

1 Then what?	McManus was furious. He was talking about tracking him down and ripping his heart out and all sorts of shit. That night we got the call.
2 What call?	Kobayashi told us where we could find Fenster.

1 NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.	THE KIND OF MAN THAT COULD HAVE KILLED EDIE FINNERAN.

1 He was accused of jury tampering.	Accused.  Not indicted.  He resigned the firm.  Divorced nineteen seventy.  Galvin worked with Michael Morrissey until Morrissey retired in 'seventy-eight.  Since then he's been on his own.  Four cases before the Circuit Court.  He lost them all.  He drinks.
2 Four cases in three years ...	The man's an ambulance chaser ...
3 ... tell me about this case.	This is a nuisance suit.  He's looking for small change.  He's asking for six hundred thousand and betting we don't want to go to court.
4 No -- we don't want this case in court.	Neither does he.  That's where he loses.  This man's scared to death to go to court.  We only have to call his bluff.
5 I want to settle this thing and be done with it.  I don't want the Archdiocese exposed.	No.  Absolutely, and we're going to see that it is not.
6 So what I want to do is stop it here.  I'm going to make him an offer.  I want to do it myself.  I want it to come from me.	All right.  But let's keep the price down.  I've called Ed Concannon.  He recommends that we continue to respond as if we're going to trial.

1 Whatever the `truth' is, let's hear that.  You were her doctor.	Yes.
2 Say it.	I was her doctor.
3 You were the anesthesiologist at her delivery May twelfth, nineteen seventy...	...I was one of a group of...
4 Answer affirmatively.  Simply. Keep those answers to three words. You weren't `part of a group,' you were her anesthesiologist.  Isn't that right?	Yes.
5 You were there to help Dr. Marx deliver her baby.  Were you not?	Yes.

1 Your Honor, Bishop Brophy and the Archdiocese have offered plaintiff two hundred and ten thousand dollars.	Huh!
2 My doctors didn't want a settlement at any price.  They wanted this cleared up in court.  They want their vindication.  I agree with them.  But for today the offer stands.  Before we begin the publicity of a trial.  For today only.    When I  walk out that door the offer is withdrawn.  As long as you understand that.  It's got to be that way.

1 ...the Archdiocese called up, they said who was our attorney, 'cause the case is coming to trial...	I doubt we'll have to go to trial ...
2 ... we told them we didn't want it to come out this way.	I completely understand ...
3 We just ...

1 I have some errands to run, and then I thought we'd spend the evening...	That's what I'd planned to...
2 I'm going to take you to the home to see the girl...	From what I've seen, Mr. Galvin, you have a very good case...
3 Yes.  Yes.  I think so.  I hope you'll be comfortable.  I'm putting you up at my...	...I made a reservation at...
4 ...apartment.   No, no. Please.  You don't know who we're dealing with, I, please believe me, they...	...What difference would...
5 These people play very rough. They don't want to lose this case. There's a lot of pressure they can bring to bear, I...	There's nothing they can do to me.

1 Yes.	Why?

1 That's it...?    Come on, guys...life is too short...  You tell me if you're playing 'chicken,' or you mean it.    Frank:  I don't think I'm talking out of school, but I just heard someone offer you two hundred grand...and that's a lot of money...and if I may say, you haven't got the best of records.	...things change.
2 ...that's true.  Sometimes they change, sometimes they don't. Now, I remember back to when you were disbarred...	I wasn't disbarred, they dropped the pro...
3 And it seems to me, a fella's trying to come back, he'd take this settlement, and get a record for himself.    I myself would take it and run like a thief.	I'm sure you would.

1 I object, your Honor...	Overruled...
2 Exception!	Noted.  Thank you.   Miss Costello was a rebuttal witness.  Her sole rebuttal was the document,  which has been disallowed...

1 Do you think it's my fault?	Isn't there something you...
2 That's not the question.  It's over.  Do you think that it's my fault?  If I'd...if I'd...I never should have taken it.  There was no way that I was going to win.	You're talking like a drunk.
3 That's what I am.

1 Are you out of your mind...?	...I'm going to need your help...
2 You need my help...?  You need a goddamn keeper...are you telling me that you turned down two-hundred- ten grand?    Huh...?  Are you nuts?  Eh?  Are you nuts. What are you going to do, bring her back to life?	I'm going to help her.
3 To do what...?  To do what, for chrissake...?   To help her to do what?  She's dead...	They killed her.  And they're trying to buy it...
4 That's the point, you stupid fuck. Let them buy it.  We let them buy the case.  That's what I took it for.  You let this drop -- we'll go up to New Hampshire, kill some fuckin' deer...

1 How are you holding up?	I'm swell.
2 And all we've got is a witch doctor!	Yeah.

1 I talked to Johnnie White at the Bar Association.   The broad used to work for one of Concannon's partners in New York awhile ago.   She wanted to move to Boston.    How badly did she hurt us, Joe?	I don't know.

1 Thank you.	You're really...  You, are you the one they told me was the nurse?
2 Who told you that?	Mrs...
3 Mrs. Simmonds.	Yes.
4 I used to be a nurse.	That's a wonderful profession.  My daughter-in-law's a nurse.  What did you do, stop?

1 Stearns, Harrington, you know who that is?	Should I?
2 A huge law firm.  Okay?  They put him in the firm, he's married, everything's superb.  Franky, he's starting to talk like he comes from Dorsetshire, some fuckin' place, 'You must drop by with Pat and me...'  Okay...?	Yes.
3 ...and he's making a billion dollars every minute working for Stearns, Harrington, and he bought a dog, and everything is rosy.   Then Mr. Stearns, he tried to fix a case.	The Big Boy did...?
4 That Frank was working on.  Yeah. He thought Franky needed some help, so they bribed a juror.  So Franky finds out.  He comes to me in tears. He thinks that anybody who knows what a 'spinnaker' is got to be a saint.  I told him ' Franky, wake up.  These people are sharks. What do you think they got so rich from?  Doing good?'  He can't be comforted.  He tells the boys at Stearns and Harrington they've disappointed him, he's going to the Judge to rat them out.	Huh.
5 Before he can get there here comes this Federal Marshal, and Franky's indicted for Jury tampering, they throw him in jail, he's gonna be disbarred, his life is over.   Jimmy, gimme another drink.    How are you?	Me, too.
6 Okay.  Now, so he's in jail.  He, finally, he gets to see the light, he calls up Harrington, he says he thinks he made a mistake.  As if by magic, charges against him are dropped, he's released from jail.   P.S.  He's fired from the firm, his wife divorces him, he turns to drink  and mopes around three and a half years.   You like that story?

1 Watched her come out of the apartment, someone I didn't know... walking in a different way... holding her head in a way I didn't know; and get into her car, and drive out to...  Golden Gate Park. Five miles. She sat on a bench at the edge of the lake and stared across the water to the old pillars that stand an the far shore, the Portals of the Past. Sat there a long time, not moving... and I had to leave, to got to the office. That evening, when I came home, I asked what she'd done all day. She said she'd driven to Golden Gate Park and sat by the lake. That's all.	Well?
2 The speedometer of her car showed she had driven 94 miles that day. Where did she go?  I have to know, Scottie. Where she goes and what she does, before I got involved with doctors.	Have you talked to the doctors at all?
3 Yes, but carefully. I'd want to know more before committing her to that kind of care.  Scottie --	I can get you a firm of private eyes to follow her for you. They're dependable, good boys --
4 I want you.	It's not my line.
5 Scottie, I need a friend!  Someone I can trust! I'm in a panic about this!

1 Just let me talk to you.	What about?
2 You.	Why?

1 I like that one.	No, there. There's a good one. Do you like that?
2 Yes --

1 You don't even want to touch me.	Yes. Yes, I do.

1 We're going awfully far.	I feel like driving. Are you terrible hungry?
2 No, it's all right.

1 I made it.	What are you going to do?
2 Look at the scene of the crime. Go on in.

1 When you...  There were pins in my hair...	Oh! Yes! Here!

1 Good-bye.	Good-bye.

1 Where were you born?	Long ago...
2 Where?

1 Don't leave me... stay with me...	All the time.

1 There are things I have to tell you, about how we met, and why we are together. But they can wait. The only important thing now is that I love you and I'm going to keep you safe.	You can't.
2 Why?	Let me go.
3 Where?	To the church, I must go there.
4 Madeleine --	Please let me go.

1 Midge, do you suppose many men wear corsets?	More than you think.
2 How do you know? Personal experience?	Please!  And what happens after tomorrow?
3 What do you mean?	What are you going to do? Now that you've quit the police force?
4 You sound so disapproving, Midge.	No, it's your life. But you were the bright young lawyer who decided he was going to be chief of police some day.
5 I had to quit, Midge.	Why?
6 I wake up at night seeing him fall from the roof... and try to reach out for him.	It wasn't your fault.
7 I know. Everybody tells me.	Johnny, the doctors explained --
8 I know. I have Acrophobia. What a disease. A fear of heights. And what a moment to find out I had it.	Well, you've got it. And there's no losing it. And there's no one to blame. So why quit?
9 And sit behind a desk?  Chairborne?	It's where you belong.
10 Not with my Acrophobia, Midge. If I dropped a pencil on the floor and bent down to pick it up, it could be disastrous!	Ah, Johnny-O...

1 Now, that's the kind of greeting a girl likes.  None of this "hello you look wonderful" stuff. Just a good straight "who do you know" --	Well, who? Come on, you know everybody.
2 Professor Saunders, over in Berkeley.	Not that kind of history. The small stuff! About people you never heard of!
3 Oh!  You mean Gay Old Bohemian Days of Gay Old San Francisco!  The juicy stories? Like who shot who in the Embarcadero August, 1879?	Yeah.
4 Pop Leibel.	Who?
5 Pop Leibel owns the Argosy Book Shop. What do you want to know?	Who shot who in the Embarcadero in August, 1879.

1 What have you been doing?	Wandering.

1 She's fucking hot!	I need a drink.

1 I was just playing...we were playing just playing around.	She's dead.

1 Four hours and fifteen minutes. I can make Vegas in 3 and change.	I'm not getting a ticket.

1 Stop it!	There's more.
2 Just stop.	Just giving the facts.
3 I'm calling the police.	What were we doing officer? Why didn't we help her? Well...we're all a bit high, you know, bachelor party, that kind of thing. Fisher here is getting married in three days...Beautiful wife ...he didn't have anything at all to do with it...It was all Micheal here... just Micheal...

1 Now I am the last to say that we have done here is a good thing. It's not. It's not a good thing. But it was, given the circumstances, the smart play. We did what had to be done. And...well...I'm proud of us. I'm proud of each and every one of us. We performed. Under the most complex and nerve shattering of situations, we stood fast and we delivered. I feel proud.	We are all going straight to hell. Either hell or prison, whichever comes first.
2 Wrong. That is flat out wrong. Hell is for cowards, for hypocrites who fear to live by the strenght of their own convictions. This is war. Given the circumstances, and given the fact that we are alive and they are not, we have chosen life over death. Two wrongs don't make a right. So our conviction and execution would only mean more death here, not less.

1 Where's the candy?	There is no candy!
2 What do you mean? It's it's a Goddamn Mini-Mart?!

1 Have you thought about what I said?	Jesus Adam, can we not get into this now please?
2 I got a migraine like a little monkey kicking in the side of my skull, Mike Tyson with a fucking sledge hammer trying to crack...	I got you.
3 Where's the bathroom?

1 She's not here.	Where is she?
2 She's here. She's just...Hold on a second.

1 Where do you look? What side of the neck?	Left side.

1 Not really.  Yes, the Fisher wedding chairs...	Prison Communication Systems.  An acquaintance friend of mine is professionally involved with a communications outfit in Denver that I just happen to know for a fact is about to be rewarded a very large, exclusive contract to rewire every state prison in Colorado. Yes sir.

1 Micheal, now is probably not the best time for this.	No, this is the perfect time. This is real time. Adam. Your brother and I, as well as several others present, have always suspected that you...  ...are a fully repressed, living in major denial, locked down, fly-boy butt-fucker.

1 After you drop the kids off, take Micheal home. Put a few drinks in him so he'll sleep.	I don't think that's such a good idea.
2 Just do it.	What are you going to do?
3 Take care of business.	What does that mean?
4 And what does that mean?  Are you insane?!  You think I would hurt Lois?! She's the mother of those kids! What is wrong with you?	I don't know...
5 You got a nasty side to your thought process.

1 I don't hate women.	You hate women.
2 False.	True.
3 Not true.	You have a King fantasy.
4 I am a lover. In Africa, you can stay king as long as you can service your women every night.	And what happens when you can't?
5 New king.

1 Stop.	Goosed!
2 Give me the Valium.

1 He just doesn't talk a lot.	Why? What's his problem?
2 He's a great chef.	He's weird. And I expect more from you.
3 You expect more what?	You're going to be hungover for three days. Like those guys on "Oprah" that get drunk and have disgusting sex with prostitutes and then say their vows with the stench of cheap hotel whore sex all over them.
4 Time out.	It's vile!

1 "Darli...ing you, ewe ewe ewe, send me, Darli...ing you, ewe ewe ewe, mend me.	"At first I thought it was infatuation ...But oh it's lasted so long..."

1 He kept saying he was protected.	What does that mean?
2 Like if something happened to him, he could still get us.	Like how?
3 I don't know. He could have told someone. He could have, like in the event of his death, somehow let someone know where those bodies are buried.	The only proof is those bodies.
4 So what do we do?	Move the bodies.
5 Move the bodies?

1 Dear God...I don't know how to pray.	Just go ahead and say what's on your mind.

1 I told her that I have no idea what Adam was talking about in that letter.	Did she believe you?
2 I have no idea.	You can tell when people believe you. It's obvious.
3 Well I don't have that skill and if I had to guess I would say that in no way did she believe me.

1 We don't think so. I mean, we just want the singing when I come out.	Okay great. What will that be?
2 We're just going to have the leader of the band sing alone with his guitar. Acoustic.	What song?
3 "You Send Me."	Oh I know that. How does it go...
4 You know,  Darling you...you send me...Darling you ...You mend me.  Honey, sing it for Judge Tower.

1 You see for me it's over. Over baby. I'm gonna turn myself in. After the wedding of course. After the wedding. Out of respect.	I don't think that's a good idea.
2 I said out of respect. Respect for you Fisher. For you and your wedding and your beautiful bride. There will be no more rain. You see where I am here?

1 Don Amalio!	What's that?
2 Enedina and Paco ...	What about them?
3 They're playing games behind the couch ...

1 What do you mean?	Nothing. I didn't say anything.

1 If you only knew ... When I was young I was full of idealism. I wanted to do something on a big scale for others, something to show my great love for humanity. But as soon as I tried to do something about it, I became afraid that I would be laughed at and I felt like a fool ... and so I went back into my shell.	Wasn't that cowardice?
2 No, it isn't that, I can assure you. I wouldn't be afraid in the face of real danger. I've proved that to myself. On the other hand, if a stranger visited me simply to say hello, I'd be alarmed.

1 Why don't you ask her to stay on for a few days?	I have asked her but she's ungrateful. Sometimes I feel like hitting her. When I talk to her about the convent, she turns to stone.

1 How much is that?	Fifteen yards.
2 That's fifteen by seven?	That's it.
3 Good.

1 She's mad.	No, not mad at all: she's rotten with religion.
2 Let her do what she wants. She doesn't bother us in any way. She minds her business and we ...

1 Me, rich? Come on!	There's plenty of money in this house. Piles of it.

1 Jorge. You frightened me. What's happening to you?	It's about time we spoke to each other, isn't it?
2 Well... is it so urgent?	If I wait until tomorrow, it'll be the same as yesterday and the day before and all the other days. When you're not with your poor people, you're praying or you disappear, I never see you.

1 It's for people!	Then let him go and he'll follow you.
2 And let him get run over by somebody else?

1 It's a very big one.	Very, very?
2 Yes -- very, very big!	He couldn't get through the door, then?

1 I have no desire to see the world again, but if you order me to...	The retreat will start soon. You can leave tomorrow morning.

1 She looks like a sick marrow!	Don't pay any attention to him. It's very good.

1 ) Daryl Lindenmeyer was only here briefly, one semester at most. But he was singularly the most brilliant student I ever had in a classroom. He created programs so beautiful, so lyrical, they were almost like symphonies...	Can you tell us what's on the disc?
2 ) There is one program with approximately 1.3 million lines of programming. It is thoroughly secured, which is not surprising considering Lindenmeyer created it.

1 What are they doing in Los Feliz?	Madison lives two blocks from their present location.
2 Why would they be going there?	I don't know.
3 I wish we could hear them.

1 Officers in Toluca Lake just found an affluent couple...completely gutted.  So were the first two cops to arrive on scene.	Their weapons missing?
2 Sid 6.7 is now armed.	Where's my gun?

1 That's also where Mr. Barnes lost his arms to Mathew Grimes' booby trap. What's your point, Dr. Carter?	Letting a lunatic like Parker Barnes loose in the free world is like lighting a fuse. At some point, he will go off -- you saw what happened in the simulator. The risk to the public is unacceptably dangerous.
2 Not if you're with him every step of the way.	The man played judge, jury, and executioner with eight people's lives. He lost control and is capable of doing it again.
3 I understand the risks involved here. But there is nobody better qualified to go after Sid 6.7 than Barnes. And, there is nobody who knows him better than you. If a situation becomes volatile, you will find a way to quell it. I have complete confidence in you.

1 How does he know who I am?	He hears...everything.
2 As a matter of fact, I do.

1 All they want to produce around here is mediocrity!	True genius is rarely rewarded within its lifetime.
2 It was you, wasn't it?	It was me, what?
3 You amped the neural connectors back up, didn't you?  You're the reason the convict died. You're the reason I got fired!	I couldn't just let them make you bring down my degree of difficulty. I'm a triple-twisting, double back flip off the high platform, not a swan dive.
4 My God...	Which God would that be, the one who created me, or the one who created you?  In your world, the Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away. But in my world, the one who gave me life doesn't have the balls to stop a couple of bureaucratic assholes from taking it away.
5 What do you expect me to do, put your character module in my pocket and just walk you out of here?	I had something a little different in mind.  Instead of just playing Peeping Tom with Reilly, why don't you get him to show you what he's been working on after hours?

1 Every day for the last five years, I told myself someday I would be out here again. No more bars. No more guards. No more fights just to stay alive.  Every day for the last five years, I told myself that lie.	It wasn't a lie.
2 Every time I said it, it was. I never really thought I was going to make it.

1 I am the demon from the bottomless pit...	... here on earth to create havoc and terror. I am War, I am death. I am destruction. David Berkowitz, 1977.
2 I am impressed.	For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak with most miraculous organ.
3 Who said that?	Hamlet.  What's David Berkowitz got to do with Sid 6.7?
4 He's part of the mix. Sid 6.7 is a composite.

1 What the hell's going on?!	This is my area of expertise.

1 We know you didn't kill those guards.	They're going to fry me for it, anyway.

1 Where the hell are you going?	Lindenmeyer never got over wanting to kill kids with more musical than he had...

1 What C-4...was Cox talking about?	Let me put it to you this way... whether I'm here... or whether I'm not...I'm leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night.
2 Where did you plant the C-4?!

1 What about it?	For Schumann.
2 Well, well, well, well, wait a minute, we got 86 percent.  We bring'em back <u>tomorrow</u>, the charts go up, they don't go <u>down</u>...

1 A new <u>take</u> on the...  Well, sir, we're coming back, we'd like you to try it out, this evening...	Listen to what I've ... listen to... does anybody know Morse Code?

1 ...his Triumphal Plane.  Shot Down.	Shot down, Forced down...  You guys are <u>missing</u> it... You're missing the <u>opportunity</u>

1 Car and a driver, Mr. Brean, the Westgate, Now, please...	Okay, look, who's takin' the press conference today?

1 ...where is the Back End coming from?	It's like that thing with the Yellow Ribbon...
2 The thing with the Yellow Ribbon...	The Hostages...?
3 The hostages, but that was a naturally-occuring...  It was a put-up job?  But where was the, where was the money in that?	In the yellow ribbon.
4 ...the Yellow Ribbon, but who, who'd profit from <u>that</u>...	The Ribbon Manufacturers.

1 ...I just missed my plane.	You missed your <u>plane</u>?  My <u>life</u> is over.  My <u>life</u> is over.  What have you <u>done</u> to me?  What have I done?  Fourteen years of Public Service...
2 Well, keep your <u>wits</u> about you, and let's see if we can't...	...fourteen years...
3 ...brazen-it-through...	Brazen it through?  Brazen it <u>through</u>?  They're going to hang us out to dry like the <u>laundry</u> --- do you know what we've <u>ddd</u>...

1 That's not bad at all.	Well, you know, "The Whole Thing's Theatre..."
2 Napoleon said, fellow won't sell you his life, but he will trade it to you for a little piece of ribbon.

1 As are we all, and I'd like to take this opportunity to suggest that the Security of the country would be ill- served by any, any...any...	Any untoward "revelation" regarding, uh...
2 And I think that the Security of the Country would be best-served by its citizens obeying its laws.  Gemme a Federal Judge, gemme search-warrants, all premises controlled by our friends, and bench-warrants for the two of...

1 OVER A SLEEPING BREAN, STRETCHED OUT ON A POOLCHAIR, GRACE, THE SECRETARY, COMES OUT ON TO THE POOL AREA, HOLDING THE SHOT OF A SMALL, FOREIGN LOOKING CHILD, IN FRONT OF A PILE OF RUBBLE. SHE SHOWS IT TO MOSS.	...we own it?

1 Schumann. We're gonna go pick him up tonight.	Where is he?
2 Out in Oklahoma.

1 Is there a press conference today?	What do <u>you</u> think?  What I need from you:  I need a base of operations.  Some place in the District.  I need some clean <u>money</u> ...

1 It's like being a producer, Mr. Moss.  The Things in Trouble.  Somebody's got to wade in, save the thing.  You get the Actors get up there, and strut and <u>Posture</u>.  But somebody, knows what's what, got to jump in and Save the Thing. 	Why Albania?
2 Why not?

1 He can't respond to the Allegations.  I don't care <u>how</u> many girlscouts are picketing the ... look, look, look, we're coming home with <u>Gold</u>.  Eh? Tell him to hold firm for <u>two hours</u>... coming home with Gold.	Did we ever use those costumes for the Border Patrol? Those guys in the Leopard-Skin <u>Hats</u>?  Here's my idea....

1 We pick up Schumann.  Sneak him back inside the Beltway. And we plan his homecoming.  Zt's gone be Neil Armstrong, Dr. Livingston, and <u>Lindy</u>...They're gonna forget, they're gonna forget, they're gonna forget that there <u>is</u> an election...The Pres's gonna have to say, one of his speeches, "Don't forget to Vote..."	I got it in the inaugural.  "Thank you for voting for me, but, <u>as</u> importantly:  Thank you for <u>voting</u>... 
2 Getting off on the inaugural?  Gonna go...	Might, if I was asked... 

1 Mmm.	What <u>kind</u> of stuff?  Hello...?

1 Pals:  Get on the <u>phone</u>... r'they flying it?	They'll be here in ten minutes.
2 Get on the phone, have'em fly in a ...whaddaya need to be a citizen?  A Judge?  Whaddaya need?  A Judge...? Call in a <u>Judge</u>, call in a Federal <u>Judge</u>, and...  If you're concerned about him, being an ..."immigrant." Make him a <u>citizen</u>... Eh?  <u>Guys</u> ... what's all this <u>mopery</u>, we...

1 I go with this here... 	Too Texan.  Go with the stick.  Thanks.  <u>What</u>...? ...does it have to be <u>Albania</u>...We're locked into Albania...why?

1 Black...	Leopard Skin...

1 What would be true, then.	Well, you  said it yourself, earlier, and if I may rephrase, that the success of the President, in the Polls...
2 ...as of today, 89% favorable.	Eighty-<u>nine</u> percent favorable, is based not on <u>events</u>...

1 What the fuck did you <u>mean</u>, "What kind of stuff?"?	...this is nothing.  This is nothing. D'you ever shoot in <u>Italy</u>?  Try three Italian starlets on Benzedrine, this is a walk in the park...
2 ...who <u>are</u> you?  Who <u>are</u> you sonofabitches... 

1 Fox says Bluestar just hit 23. What do you want him to do?	Sell it all.  What the hell, so I'll only make ten million.

1 Wanna play some tennis Saturday?	You mean teach you how to play. Can't. Going fly fishing in Canada, big client...
2 ...you take that Anacott Steel?	...light snack, but good, thanks pal, you're sharking your way up...

1 Got a little action there, eh buddy?	Marv,  ...I just bagged the elephant!

1 ... it adds up Buddy, 300 here, 200 there. Your brother never...  ...well, I always said money is something you need in case you don't die tomorrow...	How's Mom?

1 Your words, not mine...	You speak for me, son.

1 Want some?  Gordon tells me you're a very talented broker. What do you like?	Like? Uh...hmmm. Well...
2 I got this guy who should know tells me buy Hewlitt Packard but I been burned on tips. What do you think Bud?	Let's see, it closed at uh, 41 1/8...  Up a quarter...very attractive... about average yield...

1 ...rings a bell somewhere. So what?	A comer. 80 medium-body jets. 300 pilots, flies northeast, Canada, some Florida and Caribbean routes... great slots in major cities...
2 ...don't like airlines, lousy unions...	There was a crash last year. They just got a favorable ruling on a lawsuit. Even the plaintiffs don't know.

1 Revenge is a dish best served cold... well, it's payback time, sport.  ... see that building? I bought into it ten years ago. It was my first real estate deal. I sold it a couple of years later and made an $800,000 dollar profit. It was better than sex. At that time I thought that was all tne money in the world...  Now, it's a day's pay ... I had a mole in Wildman's employ. Gave me half the picture, then he got fired...	I don't understand.
2 Wildman's in town. He just became an American citizen. Something big's about to go down. I want to know where he goes and who he sees. I want you, sport, to give me the missing half of the picture...	Follow him? Mr. Gekko I...  It's not what I do. I could lose my license. If the SEC found out, I could go to jail. It's inside information, isn't it?
3 Inside information. Oh you mean like when a father tells his son about a court ruling on an airline? Or someone overhears me saying I'm gonna buy Teldar Paper? Or the chairman of the board of XYZ suddenly knows it's time to blow out XYZ. You mean that?  I'm afraid sport, unless you got a father on the board of directors of another company, you and I are gonna have a hard time doing any business...

1 The art of which is deception. Spread the buy orders through different accounts and you won't get burned...	I think I got some friends that won't mind making some easy money...

1 Hello Bud.	Gordon.
2 You sandbagged me on Bluestar.  I guess you think you taught the teacher a lesson, that you can make the tail wag the dog, huh?

1 Let's get things straight, Bud. I'm not going to take a cut. I worked hard and you can't decorate a room in New York for less than $100,000. Curtains alone...	I'm kidding, I'm kidding, we're still young, Darien. So what's money anyway when everybody's making it, it's all relative. After all, this is not the house in Connecticut, this is just a crash pad good for a couple of years...before we slip our two lovely kids, Yuppie and Fruppie into the Lycee Francaise.
2 You got it all charted out don't you, like a stock projection.	That's right -- one with high yield, rich assets and no downside...

1 Hi.	Why?
2 I figure a guy who's made some mistakes should be able to understand a girl who's made some of her own...

1 Frankly, Carl, I can't see giving much more. If you have any suggestions I'll be glad to listen.	There came into Egypt a Pharoah who did not know.
2 I beg your pardon. Is that a proverb?	No, it's a prophecy. The rich have been doing it to the poor since the beginning of time. The only difference between the Pyramids and the Empire State Building is that the Egyptians didn't have unions.  I know what this guy is about-- greed--he's in and out for the buck and he don't take prisoners. He don't give a damn about Northstar or us ...

1 Considering you brought my mother into it, $71.50.	Done. You'll hear from my lawyers. 8 a.m. Good night.

1 We need to talk. CHINA Yeah about what?	About what?  About us.
2 Us is over.  You had your chance you blew it.	Right. CHINA I need a taking care of,  not `hey how bout a pizza after class babe'.  I'm looking  for something just a little more in a man.  A little `je nes se qua'.
3 A little what? CHINA See.  You don't even speak French.	I'm sorry I'm not that good at languages ok?
4 Yeah well why should I suffer for that?	Suffer?  We're living in America.

1 Hello?	Hello, Mrs. Webster.  Is China there?
2 No Jonathan.	No?
3 She went to a waxwork party	A party at a waxwork huh?
4 Can I give her a message?	You don't happen to have the address do ya?

1 Well?	Well.   .this, is Mr. Lincoln.  And that's the man I saw at the waxwork.

1 If you sold your soul to the devil, you'd never age either	Sell my soul?
2 Any student of Black Magic can do it.   .most of these books will tell you how! SARAH So what happens when you've sold out?	You get yourself a regular job, as Satan's disciple.
3 Doing what? SIR WILFRED Tipping the scales.  Ruining that delicate balance between good and evil.  I think  that our Mr. Lincoln has found a very effective way of doing it.  There's a  voodoo belief that by making a wax effigy of an evil being, containing a  belonging of his he possessed in earthly form, and feeding him the soul of a  believing victim, you can bring him back to life!

1 Besides, Dad would have freaked.	No, he wouldn't.
2 I think playing in a band called "Bitch" might put a dent in the whole "perfect family" thing.	That's not true.
3 Yes it is.  Can we please not do that? Please?  Cause it is.

1 She finished my solitaire game and turned on the radio...she likes rock and roll. Angry rock and roll.	How do you know it's a she?
2 I saw her in the water.  Beside me.  She was filling the bathtub.	What does she look like?
3 Pretty.  She's a blond.	Do you have any idea who she is?
4 Um...I'd rather not say...just yet.	Fine.
5 What do you think I should do?

1 How're you holding up?	Just fine.  It's a lovely party.

1 He's so...it's too much...and I can't...I can't breath...	Who?  Your husband?
2 And I'm afraid.  Oh god, I'm so afraid of...

1 You must think I'm pathetic.	No.  No, I don't.
2 I'm sorry that I frightened you like that.  But I was so touched by your concern.  I've been lonely here.  Perhaps we could be friends.

1 Wow.	This is...
2 We know each other.

1 Wow.  I'm losing it.	No, you're not.  But a presence in your house is not something to be taken lightly.

1 Okay.  Okay.	I've got to find a bathroom.  I'll call you.

1 You've got a beautiful life.  And even with this, it's always been clear that he loves you.  I've come to think that's all that really matters.	I don't know...
2 Trust me, Claire.  You hear something... change the subject.  You find something... get rid of it, throw it in the lake.  You know what happened.  The rest is only details.  And no one's ever glad they got a hold of those.  If you want to put this back together...just let it go.

1 If you have to work...	No, no.  I'm just about...  There.

1 Honey, they're young.  They're probably newlyweds.	I'm telling you.  There was something in her voice...
2 Remember how we were?	Not like this.  We were never like this.  I want to go over there.  After dinner, we can--
3 Why?	To make sure she's all right.

1 It was there.  This angry music all by itself.  And I heard whispering.	What kind of whispering?
2 I don't know.  Just...whispering.

1 It's a flare.	A flare?
2 From the sun.  It's a reflection on the glass.	It's her!  I'm telling you.  She whispered and turned on the music.  She's trying to contact me!
3 It's a ghost.

1 What are you doing out here?	He killed her.  I'm not crazy.  He killed her and--
2 This is the Feur thing?	Yes.  And he's going to get away with it.

1 You were lost in the music...eyes closed...your chest heaving...	I felt you...looking through me...
2 We walked all night...	You told me that I was...

1 I was there.	Claire--
2 I came to work in the garden and I saw you with her...in my house.	Oh God...
3 I snuck back to my car, trying to convince myself it never happened.  And when I woke up in the hospital...somehow it hadn't.  Until now.

1 What's that for?	Nothing.
2 I'm cooking you dinner.	You don't have to do that.
3 I know.	Fine.  I'll do the shopping.

1 Are you alright...?  You look pale.	I wish everyone would stop commenting on my health.  I'm the doctor.

1 Don't tell Rowan about this.	Michael, Rowan should -
2 NO!  she's pregnant, Aaron.  she's got that to deal with - and the clinic.. she is not to hear about this.   don't you think I know she spends half her lite worrying about me...  Listening to my heart, aren't you...?  The Timex still ticking...?

1 Always give the crovd a taste, darling.  Now - Ryan said I'm supposed to make sure -	I don't want it.

1 She was alive all these years... You NEVER let me know her. Who gave you that right...?!	A Mayfair it ever I saw one.
2 I might as well be Rowan Smith - or Jones!   you cut me off from every -	I'm tired.  I need to rest.
3 There are things I have to know!

1 Mum...  Oh Mum, God will surely strike us -	Wind - I love you with that which is endless within me.  Bring me your eyes - your touch - your voice...

1 STOP!	Always loved you..

1 I've waited for you - the one whose science could match her powers...  Do you know what it's like - to sense the majesty of something so sublime just beyond your reach...?  to float in a dream that keeps a .promise half-hidden in its shadows.-.?  I did not choose to be such as this!  Suzanne brought me here.  She called to me!	But have I...?  Ever...?!

1 Put - him - down!  His - his heart...	How is your heart, Father...? Is the Timex still ticking...?

1 Harder...	Rowan...
2 HARDER!	Like this...?  LIKE THIS...?!
3 Yessssss...

1 You look very deep when you do that.  It's interesting.  We're Complete opposites-  I'd never just sit and wait for insparation.  I'd skip my turn and swap some letters.	Ms. yin, and Mr. yang  Aha!

1 Go to LAX and get on a flight to New Orleans.  Go to the Ponchartrain Hotel and wait for me.  I'll call you there.	Wait a minute.  Rowan - what is going on...?
2 Goodbye, Michael.   I love you.

1 I'll bet she had a wonderful smile.	Let's see.

1 Wanna snack...?	A little wine...?

1 You alright...?	A little sore.  Darm...   Finish up my section, will ya...?

1 I've never asked you to explain yourself - because you used to let me inside!  But I'm on the outside now...  you put me there!	Michael - please -  just. a little longer.  Don't leave.
2 Why bother to ask, Ro...?  Why don't you just make me stay,..?	Stop it!
3 How 'bout a backward hex with a three-quarter twist...?	You bastard!

1 A few hours and I'll be wasting away in Margaritaville.  Oh, sweet decadance.	Just don't fall off any ladders.

1 I thought you were someone else	Well I'm glad I'm not them - what are you doing here so late? Come to that, what the hell have you got that for?

1 This must be one of the old keys -	Yes - I have had it for years.

1 Oh, about six years since I graduated	And how many people have you killed?
2 I don't know	You don't know?
3 No - the police say I've killed fourteen - but I've not - I've killed many more. It amazes me how they just haven't found the bodies. What is society coming to when people just don't get missed. I agree, some of them are well hidden - I probably couldn't even show you where I put them - one girl, number eight I think the press called it - she wasn't even mine - I don't know who did it but I didn't	Where do you kill them...
4 Oh anywhere - whenever I needed to - Do you know how easy it is to take them? You just pick up a hiker, or someone off the streets - they believe so easily you know, 'Look, I have something to show you' I would say - and that would be it. One girl, I think her name is Debbie - she had broken down on the motorway, and I offered to take her to a service station to call for a tow truck - She just got in and I drove away. When I pulled into the layby and took out my knife - she just froze, and said - what do you want? - I said, You know what I want. - But she didn't. Getting rid of the bodies is just as easy - the first I cut up, put in bags with bricks in, and tossed them off Eldridge Bridge in broad daylight.  The real problem with my work is the blood - there is so much of it - and it all spurts out so fast - like a fountain. It made such a mess of	my car  I stopped working from my car.  She could have stopped me you know - If she really wanted too. That is the difference between the confusion of humanity and the purity of the beast - If a dog attacked you - you could easily kill it without any damage to yourself - Why then do people get bitten by dogs - savaged? Why?
5 I don't know	Because a dog will attack with a ferocity and force that we poses, but centuries of social contamination has run it out of us - that is what sets us aside from the purity of the beasts...Society is rotting - men who once were strong and kept everything working are getting soft - women are making them soft - by the time a pretty girl has reached twenty - she has had three lifetimes worth of fun and attention- so she doesn't deserve any more -
6 Didn't DEBBIE deserve anymore?	No she didn't...
7 What did you do with her?	You know everyone accuses me of being sick - the press, the TV - but I'm not you know - they are - I don't watch it for entertainment every night - I don't sit and watch it whilst eating my dinner - they all say, how could he cut her up? She was dead - I can't hurt something dead - And all this whilst they slobber down their processed beef burgers by the dozen - I couldn't eat one of those burgers, you don't know what has gone in them! 

1 You think I killed my MOTHER don't you?	Did you?

1 We've got nothing to talk about	LESLIE I'm sorry - I - I didn't know what to think

1 I loved you ELLEN - why did you do this?	It's what you would do to me

1 It did give me a chance to meet you again ELLEN - It's all routine you understand...So where were you?	At home alone - where were you?
2 As it happens, I was at home alone - maybe we could solve each others problems?	Get out...

1 Dr STECKLER?	Yes...?
2 INSPECTOR DAVE TAYLOR - Scotland yard ...Can I have a word?

1 I defy your hamburger theory of life, and all of the unfulfilled hopes and dreams it represents.	That's crazy talk.
2 I defy any and all limits.

1 I wonder how many of them will be at the orgy tonight?	This isn't some 80's porno film, you dip shit. There are no wild sex orgies.
2 Oh. Well. Maybe not yet.	Not ever. Never.

1 A couple of boys fighting over a pair of red silk panties is nothing compared to what he's seen.	Yeah, he's probably been serving cocktails, SO TO SPEAK, at the orgies.

1 Every one of these women thinks she should be the next Angel of the Month. It's your job, Ted, to decide which of them is right.	Let me get this straight...
2 If it isn't straight by now, son, you probably should see a doctor.	These are real, live women?
3 We don't generally feature blow-up dolls in our magazine. But hey, if you think there's a market for it.	God, I love being dead.

1 I remember the first time you walked into Mrs. Temple's class in 2nd grade. Blue gingham dress. Blond ponytail.	Which you pulled, hard!
2 That was code for "I like you."

1 We're not ashamed of you, Teddy. We don't approve of the magazine or the models or the so-called "flesh parties" you attend. But we can get past all that.	We miss you. We miss our son.
2 We miss our family.

1 I paid off the mortgage! I ordered that Winnebago you always wanted! Now you're ashamed of me?	You ordered a Winnebago?

1 Or do you have a taste for the good life, Ted? It's in your blood.	I always knew there was more. I felt it.
2 Then remember, you are the heir to a billion dollar empire. You have a staff of literally thousands. Multiply everything you ever imagined by a million and you still can't even wrap your head around everything that is yours. ALL YOURS.

1 It's a little more serious than that, Bill. The stockholders have requested a meeting. They want our guarantee that this will never happen again.  Some of them are even calling for Ted's resignation.	Look, the girls of Xenia are gorgeous, you'll see. Next month we'll be back to normal.

1 That's it? I mean, you don't want to order room service or anything? We could play games and watch movies and stuff.	Are you kidding? Mom and Dad discover I'm gone and I'll be doing hard time.
2 Are they okay?	Aside from the fact that Mom's eyes are nearly swollen shut from crying and Dad spends all his time under the car trying to fix stuff that isn't broken, things couldn't be better.
3 I miss them, too.	You can't come back. That is, you can, but your things will be in the room you currently think of as mine.
4 You're a peach.	Funny you should say that. My Grandfather was a peach farmer.

1 What do you want from me? I'm trying to be fair. But I can't keep you on staff if you turn every PTA meeting into an Agent Orange cover up.	Then I'll write about YOU.
2 Me?	"Local boy inherits more money than god." Call me crazy, but I smell human interest.
3 Really? You wanna write about me?

1 Cut to the chase, William Randolph. Your audience is way ahead of you.	In a word: MERK. EXPOSED.
2 That's two words. And I'm out of the "exposed" business, remember? I need to graduate. Besides, Merk's a boy scout.	There's gotta be something. We have to dig deeper.
3 You forget, I dislike YOU at least as much as him.	He shut down your paper!  You're stuck writing articles about swap meets and raffles and PTA brunches!

1 And I thought maybe I'd take up boating. I've always wanted to be a "coxswain."	Very ambitious. I like that.
2 The thing is, I'll need a first mate.	I know where you can find any number of naked girls who'd love to hop on board.

1 You don't have to work another day in your lives.	But how would we pay our bills?

1 Smashing!  Welcome to the family, Ted. You are going to breathe some new life into this place. You are going to set the world on fire! You are going to...call me Uncle Billy? Please?	Uh, sure. Uncle Billy.
2 I have only one concern...

1 I told you you could do it.	I was like a different person tonight.
2 You were the new and improved you.	I would have been laughed right out of Xenia.
3 No one will be laughing at you now, Ted. You can take that to the bank.	It's really going to be strange going home in a couple of days.
4 You ARE home. But go ahead, finish school, do what you feel you need to do. In the meantime, I'll be your point person here on the magazine.	Really? You'd do that for me?
5 I've been very lazy for a long, long time.	You seem like you're anything but lazy, Uncle Billy.
6 I never finished school myself. Never had to. My brother built this empire from nothing but his wife's perky tits and a whole lot of gumption. He gave me a cushy job on a silver platter. I never struggled for a second.	My parents always say hard work builds character.
7 It's not like I didn't have ideas, I had plenty of ideas. But I never even shared them with your father. Never had the guts.	What kind of ideas?
8 Well...for one thing...I think it's despicable that we exclude so many women that only fit our western notion of "classic beauty."	You think we should be more open minded?
9 The world is a big, beautiful place.  We can open new markets in Africa and Asia.  Imagine the Dali Lhama reading our magazine.	In other words, our scope is too narrow.
10 At our press conference tomorrow, I think we should announce our plans to explore the world. Not just a few leggy 36D's, with blond hair upstairs and down.	That's perfect.

1 What are you doing?	My job. Back off, Benedict.

1 How you doing, Artie?	I... You know... I...

1 Wasn't enough Van Ryan had to destroy the people who invested here.  He got to be old, he and his rich cronies would come down here, hunt and whore, act like assholes.  One trip he showed up with this young girl he'd picked up somewhere, gotten her pregnant then dumped her in the swamp.  That came with her.	And the child...
2 She had it, before she drank herself to death.  Wasn't exactly a love child...	Suzie.  Then you're not her grandmother...
3 Raised her like she was, but no, Walter's my only child.  He was a good boy, till the army took him.

1 How long?	She didn't cone home last night.  We found her car at the bus terminal, but nothing to suggest she bought a ticket.
2 Maybe she used another name.	Ray thinks she was murdered.

1 That's what they called it when I was in Juvenile.  It's a pretty dismal place.	It's a shithole.  But she was dirty, what was I gonna do?

1 It's starting, Gloria.  This is how it begins...	Ray.  We don't know anything yet.  She could be anywhere...

1 You didn't tell me you were gonna put me on the fucking news.	We need to tape the interview, Suzie. No one will see it but us.  Now when was this, that Mr. Lombardo gave you the ride?

1 Oh, Ray... no...	You think this is just about money, about us looking foolish?  Question him. You're gonna find a stone cold manipulative psychopath.  And those girls are going to wind up dead...

1 This wasn't my idea.	I'm sorry?

1 You're gonna fuck me over, aren't you?	Oh, for Christ's sake.
2 You are.	Are you retarded, or just brain dead from whiffin' fumes out there in the swamp...

1 Is that Sam Lombardo?	Hi, Mon.
2 Sam!  Hi!

1 Look, he forgot.  I knew it.	No I didn't.  Check out the Jeep.  It's nice and dirty for you.  But you might want to wait a minute. The Mercedes is leaving.

1 Kelly.  Is Suzie there?	Yes.
2 Shit.  I was afraid of that.  She left this garbled message on my machine.  Can you calm her down?	Why can't you come...
3 No!  Christ.  Listen, Kelly, I'm counting on you.  You calm her down. I mean do whatever you have to, whatever it takes...	You know what it takes.
4 Then do it.  I need you on this Kelly. Do it tonight.  We'll figure something out... Okay?

1 Can't you take that stupid thing off?	Not in here.  Chiropractor comes in here for lunch sometimes.

1 You ought to watch it with that shit, Suzie.  You get busted again, you go back in a two-tine loser.	You got something against cigarettes?

1 But you do admit to touching her, to putting your arm around her.  Isn't that against the rules?	It is and I don't.  Ordinarily...  But, I mean... there's this kid standing in front of you crying...
2 With a thirty-five inch bustline in a wet T-shirt with no bra...

1 Yeah, right.	Good.  Just keep telling yourselves that, the only people who can fuck this up is us.

1 Sandy... What's up?	Listen, Kelly skipped school.  Have you talked to her?
2 No.	Shit. Here we go again.
3 Didn't you see her this morning?	To tell you the truth, I haven't seen her since Friday.

1 Your little jack-in-the-box gun. That might be useful.	Well... it's the only one I have. It's gotten me out of quite a few tight spots...

1 Now, what was that?	You're either having a seizure or you just said "hello."
2 Good, I wasn't sure you were up to it.

1 You might have mentioned you had that.	I thought all you needed were your fists and your gun.

1 Got to be somewhere that's hot. He said it was "damnably hot."	That rules out Willard, Vermont; Willard, Minnesota...  Willard, New Mexico?

1 Are those just button buttons or...?	Of course not.

1 He calls it the Tarantula.	But it only has six legs.

1 You must excuse the Doctor.  No one has ever beaten him at his little game.	I don't like to lose, either.

1 Would you be thinking... ramming speed, sir?	I would, Mr. Doyle!  Are you game?

1 Where'd he say he was going to do this?	He didn't.  That's your job.  I'm taking you off that other case until you've nabbed this lunatic. Good luck.  Nice train.  But mine's nicer.

1 The U.S. is my jurisdiction.	Exactly!  You are on foreign soil. You are a representative of the occupying forces.  Or haven't you checked a map lately?!

1 Now it's a bomb.	It is?

1 You gonna be a hero, Madmartigan? I've lost half my men fighting Kael, and Bavmorda, and the Nock- maar army.  Now you and this Peck, and that magpie up in the rafters, are gonna take 'em on alone?	Then come with us.

1 They look like acorns.	Anything you hurl them at will turn to stone.

1 I do what I'm told.	Too bad you're not more like your father.

1 Bavmorda cannot transform you. I've protected this camp with a spell.	Can you use your magic to get our men into the fortress, Raziel?

1 I'll be around long after you're dead, Airk!  You slime!  When I get outa here I'll cut your head off and stick it on a pig-pole!	Friend of yours?

1 Where's the baby??	I thought you had her!

1 She asked about you, Madmartigan.	Well what did she say?

1 I could be you rguard!  I could carry your spear!	What a great son you are, Ranon.  I wish I could take you with me.  Now go to sleep...

1 We don't have much time left!  Go on!  Go on!	I must concetrate my imagination...to creat a new...reality!
2 What's the magician's weapon?	The limitless power of...

1 I did it!  Madmartigan!  Come here! Look!  You gotta see this!  I did it!	More!  More!

1 We gotta follow them.	Us??  We'll never catch them.  Any- way, we're all done, Teemo.  Let's go home.

1 Talk!  Say something!	I can't see anything--she's too bright!

1 Where's Timmy and Buck?	Upstairs, asleep. Where'd you think?
2 You've got a man here and the kids are upstairs?	That's none of your goddamn business! So keep your goddamn holier-than- thou mouth shut!  Anyway, they like Fred.
3 Oh sure, Fred.

1 Who'd you see, Sam? The man on the floor?	No... I saw the man who killed him.

1 What's your first move?	A hot shower... I haven't changed clothes in two days.

1 Look, I'm genuinely sorry...	No you're not   You're glad, because now you've got a witness.  I heard the other police talking last night.  They don't seem to like you very much.
2 They kid a lot.	I would not be too sure.

1 Who are they?	The leadership of our district... the diener. Bishop Tschantz is the one with no hair on top. They decided to come and see you for themselves. Except Stoltzfus, of course. He came the first day. I think he saved your life.
2 Can I have something to drink?

1 Eli is a fine carpenter. Best in the district. He and his father built the big house themselves forty years ago.	Oh?  What happened to Hochstetler?
2 We had some lemonade and he left.	A real fireball.

1 Listen carefully, I wrote the Amish woman's name and address on my desk calendar, I want you to lose it for me, Now. Tonight.	What the hell are you talking about? What's happening.
2 Nothing. I'm not going to be around for a while. I'll call you when I can.	Johnny, what the fuck?
3 Listen to me  Schaeffer's part of it. Maybe at the top of it.

1 Everything okay?	Yes, thank you very much.
2 John said you're Amish.	Yes.
3 Oh.

1 I am not a child.	You are acting like one!
2 I will be the judge of that.	No! They will be the judge of that! And so will I... if you shame me!
3 You shame yourself.

1 Is this where we're going?	Of course not. We're going to Baltimore. It's much nicer in Baltimore.

1 Poor little orphan, and her Miss Gulch troubles. Gosh all hemlock - you know, she ought to have somebody to play with.	I know, but we all got to work out our own problems, Henry.
2 Yes.	Oh, I hope we got them in time.
3 Yes.

1 If you were really great and powerful, you'd keep your promises!	Do you presume to criticize the....

1 No!  No -- no!  Here -- you can have your old slippers -- but give me back Toto.	That's a good little girl.  I knew you'd see reason.

1 Are you ready now?	Yes.  Say goodbye, Toto.

1 ...room --	Has it poppies on the wall....

1 ...m...m...my, my, my, my goodness -- I can talk again! Oh -- oil my arms, please -- oil my elbows.	Oh...

1 And bears!	What sort of an animal is that?
2 It-it-it-it - it's a huge one!

1 Now I know I've got a heart -- 'cause it's breaking.	Oh --  Goodbye, Lion.  You know, I know it isn't right, but I'm going to miss the way you used to holler for help before you found your courage.

1 Who's her?  Who's her?	It's the Witch!  She's followed us here!

1 Oh -- Oh -- Oh!  Toto -- Toto!	Did they hurtcha?
2 Lion, darling -- I knew you'd come!

1 Whhhooops!  Ha-ha -- there goes some of me again!	Oh -- does it hurt you?
2 Oh, no -- I just keep picking it up and putting it back in again.	Ohhh --
3 My, it's good to be....

1 ...just that the Witch is so wicked. I don't think you two ought to come with me because you'll get into trouble.	Oh, you don't think we're going to stand by and let her get away with fireballs and bees, do you?

1 Oh -- Oh --	Oh -- are you -- are you all right?

1 Comin' to think of it, forty winks wouldn't be bad.	Don't you start it, too!

1 Where -- where do we go now?	This way!  Come on!

1 There. Now, that's the best we can do without any pins.	Yeah --

1 ...of the West.	B-B-B-B-B-But if we do that, we'll have to kill her to get it!

1 Hey, Dorothy!	Dorothy!

1 Who do you suppose they were? And where did they take her? A fine thing - to go to pieces at a time like this!	Now, now, don't fret.
2 Oh, dear, dear.	We'll get you together!

1 Well --	You promised us real things -- a real...

1 They wont get far. Every warhead has a locator card.  A Miratom device.  Emits a high-pitched signal on Russian emergency frequencies. We can track the bomb.	With this?

1 Do you know what youre doing?	Like riding a bike.

1 Elektra?  Running King Industries?  Ive known that girl all her life. Im not sure she knows what shes walking into.	Shes not a girl anymore.

1 Not the usual Swiss procedure, Mr. Bond, but you understand, a man in my position..	Which is neutral, no doubt.

1 He was my father.	Im sorry.
2 He died before he could complete his lifelong dream.  I intend to finish it for him.

1 I cant stay.	I know.

1 How did you survive?	I used my body on the guards.  It gave me control. I got to a gun and I took my chance.  Ive never told anyone that.

1 Was this all about the oil?	It is my oil!  Mine and my familys!

1 That is 5,000 dollars of Beluga ruined!	You are out of your league.  Shes working with Renard.

1 In the good old days, the KGB had three or four spots where our submarines could surface without anyone knowing. But Yevgeny is supposed to be loading cargo.	What class sub does your nephew run?
2 C-class.

1 Everythings under control up here.  Are you ready?	Yes.  Au revoir...

1 Had a lot of blood in him.	You oughta see upstairs.  It's a slaughterhouse.
2 No idea who's behind this?	Small army, from the looks of it.  He put up one hell of a fight.

1 I guess you'll be dismantling Russian tanks soon.	You mean Afghanistan?  It won't require my attention.  What I'm doing here is far more interesting.

1 Then it's going to happen.  The world's going to end.  -- And you've always known.	Always.  Ever since the day I died.

1 Who?	I don't know, but . . . in the wake of all that's happened, I'm starting to think Rorschach may have been right.  Is Laurie okay?
2 She's with me.	Good.  Be careful, Daniel, don't let up your guard.  Look, I'm going to head south for a while -- hole up at Karnak until all this blows over.  You two would be welcome to join me.
3 Thanks for the offer, Adrian.  I'll let you know.

1 Christ yes, I went in for a cancer scan first thing.  Gave me a couple of rough nights, I'll tell you . . .  How about you, Laurie?	Oh, yeah.  They gave me a clean bill of health and then booted me the hell out.  No expense account.  No place to live.
2 You'll find something.  -- I should go.  You and me, seeing each other, someone might put two and two together . . .

1 -- What is it.	I know what you're thinking.  You'd be a lot safer if I weren't around.
2 Laurie --	I'm an open target, Dan.  If you're with me --
3 With any luck, the world'll end before we get ours.

1 What?	The costumes.  Am I right?

1 Hiya, pardner.  Long time no see.	Did anybody follow you?  See you come here?

1 Sorry, Daniel.  You've always been a good friend.  I know that.  Sorry about Laurie.	Okay, let's just . . . thank you.

1 Their real names, please.	I don't know their real names.
2 You're lying, Miss Juspeczyk.	I don't know their real names!
3 You're not "protecting" anyone.  These people's lives may depend on the answers you give.  These are all former associates of Dr. Manhattan --	Then why don't you ask him?!?

1 Terrorist.  Radical agitator.  Stool pigeon.	ALL RIGHT!  ALL RIGHT!!  -- How'd you find me?

1 Congratulations, you've just graduated at the head of your class.	You're a cold piece of work. You almost got three people killed out there.
2 Good thing you were there to save the day. Come walk with me.

1 Thanks.	You're a grungy little phoenix, you know that? Keep up the good work.
2 You ain't seen nothing yet.

1 We seen this kind of parachutes before, you know. U.S. Army. You got some friends here, jump out with you guys?	We're anti-social. We don't have any friends.

1 Where are you going?	Why are you still hanging around? Your business is finished, you should go home.
2 I was invited. What's your story?	I don't know who you are or where you come from, but I don't like you. You ask too many questions.

1 So what's the plan with this Ahab? Are they selling it or what?	No, something worse. He says it's a surprise, but I know him. This is his masterpiece.
2 We've got to find out what it is. Can you handle that?	There's something I didn't have time to tell you before.
3 What's that?	I'm a agent as well. KGB. I've been undercover for over a year.
4 You're what? What the hell have you been doing?	I don't know. Eight months ago I stop hearing from my people. No explanation, just silence. So I stay and I wait like I was told. Soon I'm in so far, they'd kill me if I left. Now every day I get farther and farther away from what I was. I'm like you said, a criminal.
5 I'm busted up for you, but Jesus, what the hell are you doing? Those people almost drowned on that boat and you didn't lift a finger.

1 Where'd the damn truck go?!	Go to the water, it's that way!

1 The Peace conference...	Nice place to start, don't you think?

1 What...?	I was gonna wait till the islands, but...
2 You're serious?	Of course I'm serious. I bought it, didn't I?
3 This is so typical. I can't believe you. I've barely seen you for the last three weeks and now this? Are you out of your mind?	I don't know. I thought this is what you wanted. You want stability, here it is.
4 You can't just propose to me out of nowhere. You think that's going to solve our problems? I'm sorry, X. It was a kick for a while, but it's over. You're just not going anywhere.	You're not exactly "going anywhere" yourself.
5 You're wrong about that. I'm heading out that door right now.

1 Who's writing this dude's dialogue?	He's a pretty good actor, though.

1 I had to inspect the merchandise first.	Of course.

1 And you. Why do you have such a problem staying away, my friend? Did you miss us that much?	I wanted to get the hell out of Prague before Silent Night falls.
2 Not bad, man, not bad. You put things together quick. Prague it is.

1 What's wrong with him?	His vital signs are weak and getting weaker.

1 I'm o.k.  I'm o.k.	Sure you are, sport.

1 This was taken by a state police officer in Secaucus, New Jersey.  A man in a minor altercation literally melted the car in front of him.  I don't know where you come from, Ms. Grey, but where I come from, you don't go melting people's cars when they cut you off.  You do it the old fashioned way -- you give 'em the finger.  But what you presume to tell this committee -	I presume nothing, I am here to tell you that in time, the mutator gene will activate in every living human being on this planet.  Perhaps even your children, Senator.
2 I can assure you, there is no such creature in my genes.

1 What are you going to do?	In the road to survival, there is always sacrifice Logan.  We are the future... not them.  We must protect ourselves.  After tonight, when the leaders of the world return home -- They will return as brothers, as mutants... and our cause will be theirs.  This is survival, I know you understand that, Logan... or is it Wolverine?

1 Why?  You have a home here now, if you want it.  Everyone will...	What?... miss me?  Charley, I'm gonna walk out the front door and trust me, it won't be soon enough for everyone here.

1 I wouldn't really have let you die, you know.  I just needed...	I know.

1 Yes, sir.	He has a big mouth.  Yes!  It seems to me I did read something about that incident as a student.  But you have to remember that a worm -- with very few exceptions -- is not a human being.

1 Darling!	Hello...?
2 Surprised?	Well... yes.
3 Miss me?	I...

1 Are you suggesting I call him master???	No, of course not.  I just meant...
2 All right then!

1 What are you waiting around for, pickle puss?	This wire came while you were gone. Your fiancee will be arriving any moment.
2 Elizabeth!?!  'Can't waits any longer.  Arrive in your arms at ten tonight.' Oh, God!  Not tonight.

1 Isn't it true that Darwin preserved a piece of vermicelli in a glass case until, by some extraordinary means, it actually began to move with voluntary motion?	A piece of what?
2 Vermicelli.	Are you speaking of the worm, or ... the spaghetti.

1 Suit yourself...I'm easy.  Better watch out for the wockers.	What wockers?
2 The wockers with the knockers.	Wockers with the knockers???
3 Go ahead, play dumb!  You'll lose your sockers and then be fockers.

1 What a filthy job!	Could be worse!
2 How?	Could be raining!

1 Cold!  Cold and dead!	You mustn't take it so hard. Bucharest wasn't built in a day.

1 Repeat it anyway -- it's a wonderful cue.	... I'm glad that's...
2 No, no!  That whole thing!	... Whew!  I'm glad that's over with.

1 MMMMMMMMMMMMMNNNNNNmmmmmmmm?!?	It's alive!

1 May I see your violin?	It's an honor for me, sir.  You play the violin?
2 Oh, just a little.

1 Ooh!	What a filthy mess.

1 What are you going to do?	I think I'll...carry him.

1 It wouldn't be fair to Elizabeth.	Of course not.

1 No, not sound.	There must have been someone else down here then.

1 Another fifteen seconds to go.	Do Something!  Stall them!

1 Oh... indeed. Crealock, we should see that Colonel Dumford has an Officer for his hard riders. Perhaps a subaltern from the Twenty Fourth.	I thought it might be more effective to find someone who speaks Zulu.

1 Stuart?	Yes.
2 How quickly can you move your artillery forward?	Well, my horses are feeding, as you may observe, Mr Coghill. It'll take a little while.
3 Well, fed or hungry, Pulleine wants them in position immediately. .	Right.  Bombardier, to me please.
