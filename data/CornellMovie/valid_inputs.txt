Can we make this quick?  Roxanne Korrine and Andrew Barrett are having an incredibly horrendous public break- up on the quad.  Again.
Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part.  Please.
How do you get your hair to look like that?
I figured you'd get to the good stuff eventually.
The "real you".
I have to be home in twenty minutes.
Oh my God, does this mean you're becoming normal?
Oh, I thought you might have a date  I don't know why I'm bothering to ask, but are you going to Bogey Lowenstein's party Saturday night?
But
Why didn't you tell me?
Oh, God.  It's starting.
Why do girls like that always like guys like that?
He always have that shit-eating grin?
He's pretty!
What 're you talking about?
Yeah
Hey.
Nope - just came by to chat
Well, actually, I thought I'd run an idea by you.  You know, just to see if you're interested.
I appreciate your efforts toward a speedy death, but I'm consuming.  Do you mind?
Are you following me?
Kat! Wake up!
I guess I never told you I'm afraid of heights.
My grandmother's .
I don't understand the allure of dehydrated food.  Is this something I should be hip to?
So tell me about this dance. Was it fun?
Which parts?
Bianca did what?
I think I speak correctly when I say that Cameron's love is pure.  Purer than say -- Joey Dorsey's.
I don't understand, Patrick.  You haven't done anything asinine this week. Are you not feeling well?
What just happened?
Did I have anything to say about it?
Don't you realize your words could be considered heretical?
Beatrix, I want to ask you something.
Do you swear on all the Holy Saints in heaven?
They don't see sin in their nakedness.  They live according to nature, in a never ending summer. The islands are covered with trees, filled with blossoms and fruits. And...
To bring the word of God.
... and also to bring medicine.
Colon!
I cannot ignore the verdict of my council.
In one act of brutality, you have created chaos.  Tribes who were fighting each other are now joining forces against us!  All that because of your criminal savagery!
You'll be held in detention, deprived of your privileges and possessions.  Until you are returned to Spain where you will be judged. Have you anything to say?
Every ship returns with a cargo of sick and dying.  But with no gold! The new world proves expensive, Your Majesty.
That's what he did to me.  He put cigarettes out on me.
Out on my back when I was a small boy.
I'm not a whore.  I'm not a whore.
You don't know.  I'm sorry.  I was desperate.  That's not me.  I shot a cop.  Can you imagine what they'll do to me when I got to prison?
Are you here illegally?  Don't worry about that.  We'll talk to Immigration. They won't deport you.
Coffee for me, I gotta slow down.
Who's there?
I have nothin' to say.  If you wanna contact my attorney...
What would you call her?
She's fucked.  Even if that story is true.
Detective - can you tell us what happened here?
Sooner or later that's everybody.
I think you're getting a little moody there, Eddie.
Were you a fireman?  That how you knew how to rig the apartment?
Next.  Could I see your documents, please?
Look.  New videocameras.  Color viewfinder.  Image stabilization. Solarization.  Night vision.
What is that?
I'm serious...this - this is a great American film.  Full of violence and sex.  And I want my credit.
Yes.  Before we hand in the next video - I put titles on it and my credit is going to read - Directed by Oleg Razgul.
Isn't he a little moody?
I'll take him.
We're takin' him.  Don't argue!
Well, he killed my partner!
You see Eddie's face when I gave him the timer?  Wish I had a picture of it.
What??
Take the car.  Get outta here, Tommy.
Dave, if you've a minute, I'd like your advice on something.
Well, it's nothing really important, but it's annoying.
It's about my salary cheques.
It's the last one.
If you're determined to revive the crew now, I can handle the whole thing myself. There's no need for you to trouble.
Look, Dave your've probably got a lot to do. I suggest you leave it to me.
I'm having a party tomorrow.
Are you coming to my party?
When are you coming home?
Well, thank you very much for being so understanding.
Well.. Did you have a pleaant flight?
Well, shall we go through Documentation?
Yes, it does. The sub-surface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago.
By the deformation between the mother rock and the fill.
Five by five, Frank.
I understand.
Roger.
Now how's your memory doin'?
Maybe I better ask around, see what your pals think.
You're in a hurry.
You just quit bein' a priest or somethin'?
What's the matter with my place?
You lying son of a bitch...
Hey, no way.  Take off the bracelets or no deal.
No way to start a partnership.
You really do have onoe, huh, Jack... what's her problem besides you?
This place don't seem real popular with the brothers.
We split 50-50?
You gonna let me keep any of it?
I suppose you'd never be like Luther and let a woman get to you...
What about Luther?
Sorry we didn't do better, Jack. I feel like I let you down.
Thanks.
That's what you say, Cates...
But that's what you say about all of us all the tine ... we're always the ones fucking up when you tell it...
I got to wait for a call.
A guy in the bar called me a dumb bitch today.
Irrigated his face with the shot of J and B I'd just poured him. Then I tried to deck the sucker.
Then I sit back and I think, I mean, who's to say I'm not a dumb bitch.  I work in a bar, right? I can't read a list of my academic credentials to every booze-hound that comes in the place... You are what you do...
Aren't you the one that thinks all psychotherapy is bullshit?
If this is your idea of sympathetic interest in my problems, I'll take brutal indifference.
Tell me--I'm dyin' to hear it.
Just one.  Some lady called.  Said she's a little hot-headed sometimes... But she still wants her occasional roommate. She'd like to talk it over after she gets off work tonight... if it's humanly possible....
Whaddya think?
Stall.
You want to go outside?
Vano da, mechteba?! Soun domo kala chon hammas!
Who are you?
Imagine for a moment that this. thing is not anything that can be identified because it prefers not to be, because it is the antithesis of all we are. Because it is evil.. TOTAL EVIL.
What's she doing?
I'm sorry, but... the Stones...
...Priest...
I'm coming!. Ma, what're you talking about?
...Quiver ladies, he's gonna set the world on fire right here from 5 to 7! You'll know everything there is to know about the D-man. His dreams, his desires, his most intimate of intimates.  And from what I'm looking at intimate is the stud muffin's middle name. So tell me my main man... you nervous in the service?
What did you say? What did you do?
Valo massa... Chacha hamas.
I told you I need to work in peace. Remember? I need to concentrate.
The cash man!
I want your best man on this!
How's that? Can you hear me better now?
Who gives a shit! I didn't come here to listen to music! Listen up instead of running off at the mouth! The batteries on my phone are almost gone.
Dispatch me another ZFX200 immediately. Someone stole mine.
This is the mortgage.  This is Cindy's college money.
Sometimes you can't know what I'm doing.  It's better that way.
It's a missing persons case... a long shot.  I'll give it two months, two months at most, then I'll be back.  We'll take a vacation.
Anything harder?
Snuff?
You know where I can get it?  I have a lot of money to spend.
Where's that?
Don't let Longdale's questionable choice of weapon give you any ideas. If his fey little gun puts enough little holes in you, you'll be just as dead... and so will Max.
I'm gonna kill you.
You know how my tapes sell.  People eat this stuff up.
Maybe there's something wrong with the scumbag customers coming into your place, ever think of that?
Look, you cocksucker...
Big date tonight?
Can I interest you in a battery operated-vagina?
My boss tells me I have to do more suggestive selling.
It's your call, but you're gonna be sorry when you're in one of those everyday situations that call for a battery-operated vagina and you don't have one.
Dino Velvet... yeah, he's like the John Luc Godard of S+M flicks, supposed to be a real weirdo.
His stuff comes out of New York. Bondage and fetish videos, Gothic Hardcore.  Definitely not for the squeamish.
You're learning.
Out of the back of bondage magazines mostly, but you can find it on the street if you look.  He'll also do commissions, for enough money...
Alright, I get the picture.
Well, I'm in New York now.  What do you say to flying out and giving me a hand?
Take a vacation.  I'll pay you four hundred a day, plus expenses.
Consider it.  Meanwhile, dig up whatever Dino Velvet films you can. Get receipts.  I'll call back.
Mister Welles. You're very prompt.
I didn't know what to think.  I can't tell you how horrible it's been, to know this belonged to my husband.  To know that he watched this... this atrocity.  But, I can't go to the police...
I've been hired as an independent contractor by the U.S. Resource Center for Missing Persons as part of an internal audit.  If you have any time over the next few days, I'd like to make an appointment to ask some questions about the disappearance of your daughter.
I'm sorry, let me explain, the R.C.M.P. is a support organization and archive, not unlike the Center for Missing and Exploited Children in Washington.  I'm sure you've dealt with them before?
You were right.  I didn't find anything.  I'm going to run and get something to eat. Are you hungry?
The um... you'll find my invoice in the envelope. If that's all...
Hey, since when do you play Thomas Edison?  This looks like Sheila's.
Ohhhhbaby, I am dead on my feet.
Not really.
Asthma attack...what 17-year old has a fatal asthma attack?  She was gonna be a doctor.
Enough of that crap.
Something wrong with the stairs?
What?
We know you've been through a lot but there's more than your feelings at stake here.
Where is he?
Where are we going?
What's that got to do with it?
You think that's the place she's buried?
I want to talk to both you guys about Greta.  And...
They think I'm nuts.
These things are wild...  What do you think?
You, too?
They're so remote - cold - beautiful, the stars.  But now - I wonder -
You all wait here.  I'm going inside, take a look.
Dave - !
Now they feel it...down below.
I'm - afraid I have some bad news for you, Reef -  You'll have to share quarters, this trip.
What's the corrected bearing to the Magnetic Pole?
See what?
This is from three years ago. Some difference, huh?
I went down to Concord to check it out. The president is Mel Gordon. The vice-president and treasurer is Gordon LaRiviere. Those boys are buying up the mountain, Wade. $364,000 this year. I believe that's out of LaRiviere's league.
No.
I'm okay.
Aw, shit, she's here to get Jill. Me and Jill had a little argument. Jack, I got to get back, get back to town. Move this thing, will you? See if you can get back to the Town Hall before they get there, okay?
She's gone already!  Gone already! Couldn't wait.
That's all you got to say? "Yes".
She won't be here for a half hour. Think you can stand it that long?
Tomorrow, Gordon.
Wade, you're done.  Let me have the shop keys.
The key, Wade.
Don't worry. I can protect my virtue. I mean, c'mon, Wade, give me a break.
You okay?
Strange.
Of course! I would've heard.
Who are you?
He's asleep. We were up very late.
Mrs. Gordon. Thank you.
Something about my father?
Jesus, Pop, how can you stand the cold, dressed like that? Where's Ma?
You remember Margie Fogg?
How you and Ma doing? Haven't seen you in town for a while.
Lillian was here. In Lawford.
The night before the shooting.
Picked up Jill. She was supposed to visit for the weekend for Halloween. She wanted to go home.
Jill. I was thinking of getting a lawyer. Maybe you can help me.
I know what it means. I'm just running out of ways to use it.
Daddy. Daddy, please...
How you doing, sweetie?
Who's flying the fucking plane?
Apparently taking uzis away from sixth graders isn't as popular as we thought it'd be.  Representative Taylor is working on a compromise.
Air Force One, please reduce speed to 250 knots.
We copy. Stand by...  Tower?
This is Romeo Tango Zulu changing call signs.  Tower, alert air traffic, Romeo Tango Zulu is now Air Force One.  This is Air Force One... The President is safe onboard.
Leave my daughter alone.
What do you know of my husband?
My husband is a very courageous man.
This administration does not negotiate with terrorists.
The northern border's gotten a bit hairy. Their MiGs are playing tag with our Tomcats and our boys are just itching to engage.
I'll make it up to you, I promise.
and if that means negotiating...
I said it's not worth the fight.  Steward, please.
IT'S OPEN!
Oveur.
Elaine, what happened to us?
Ted, get a grip on yourself.  You should never have left the hospital.
I've never used the word insane, Ted.
The word is sick.  Ted -- very, very, very sick.
I'd use the word insane.
Ted seemed to get worse after I told him about Simon, Doctor.
Simon, I'm going to check ROK's secondary readout unit.
Will Scraps be able to sit with us, Dad?
No, a bomb.  Now, as discreetly as possible, I want you to move the passengers into the lounge.
Striker.
That damn computer has taken over.  I'm getting out.
Don't talk to me about Elaine.  Outta my way!
Shep, sit...sit! So, I understand you've got a real emergency down there.
What is it, Doctor? What's happening?
Look, you'll be back in town tomorrow night. We'll have dinner -- talk it over.
Elaine, not yet. I promise you I really can change.
What's his problem?
We have a visitor.
Jack, isn't that Fred Bliffert over there in the blue turtleneck? Maybe he's on our flight to Chicago.
Sorry, Clarence. Latest weather report shows everything socked in from Salt Lake to Lincoln.
Excuse me, sir. There's been a little problem in the cockpit and I was wondering...
In there.
... and we work my hours.  I'll do the driving, you do the paperwork. You gotta learn it so you might as well do it all.
What's that?  Look, Jetson.  Get this straight in your head.  We're not pals, we're not married, and we ain't gonna take long moonlight walks together... We're just partners.  And don't call me Sergeant.  Call me Sykes... or Matt if you have to.
Get the picture?
Well... Yeah, it's rubber.  It stretches.
You know that guy?
How could a straight-arrow like you ever pick a roommate like him?
Your home is quite disordered.  I thought perhaps you had been burglarized when I walked in.
Stop the car.
Please, I must get out here.
George, uh... you're gonna break his little chest bones...
You said you wanted the biggest thing I could find... Well, this is it.
Casull .454 Magnum.  You're talking twice the impact energy of .44 Magnum hot loads.
Yeah, the shells are too big for six in an cylinder.  Hell, Matt, you don't need but one.
You know I've been over all this with Fedorchuk and Alterez this morning...
Hope their plumbing's the same.
...that's better.  Pan it around a bit.
I'll go.
I'm really the only one qualified to remote-pilot the ship anyway. Believe me, I'd prefer not to.  I may be synthetic but I'm not stupid.
You had them eating out of your hand, kiddo.
No good.  How do we know it'll effect their biochemistry?  I say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit.  It's the only way to be sure.
We're talking thermonuclear explosion.
At ease.  I'm sorry we didn't have time to brief before we left Gateway but...
Yes, Hicks?
What's the question?
We got problems.
Now many?
Hicks, don't let him leave.
You can't help them.  Right now they're being cocooned just like the others.
Twelve meters.  Man, this is a big fucking signal.  Ten meters.
I guess we're not leaving, right?
Come on.  Crawl faster.
A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish. Be my most tasty little dish! Be my most tasty little dish!
A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish.
A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish.
Is she a good fuck?
Your Grace, I've got something to tell you. I want to complain about this man.
Why not?
That's stupid.
Do you think that's funny?
We'll have a little party. Come in. Come in. You know Herr Schikaneder?  This is! a very nice girl.
Yes, my love?
Salzburg.  We were just talking about Salzburg.  If you've come from my friend the Fartsbishop, you've arrived at just the right moment. Because I've got good news for him. I'm done with Vienna. It's over, finished, done with! Done with! Done with!
What?
Frau Mozart?
How charming.  But why did he not come himself?
What are you doing here?
Why you?
Well, thank you very much. You can go now.
No, he doesn't. And I don't want you here. Just go, please.
He's adorable!
Really?
Good morning, Court Composer. This is my niece, the Princess Elizabeth.
Why so?
Bravo, Mozart. Most charming. Yes, indeed. Clever man.
I write to you with urgent news. I am coming to Vienna. Take no further steps toward marriage until we meet. You are too gullible to see your own danger. As you honour the father who has devoted his entire life to yours, do as I bid, and await my coming.
I'm tired of this game. Please play without me.
I think I've found out about the money, sir.
I'm serious. You write a proper part for me with a couple of catchy songs, I'll guarantee you'll have a triumph- de-luxe. Mind you, it'll have to be in German.
Of course! What else do you think they speak here?
I'm sorry. No.
Mozart. It was good of you to come.
Did my work please you?
Yes?
You flatter me.
Where did I stop?
So now the Confutatis. Confutatis Maledictis. When the wicked are confounded. Flammis acribus addictis. How would you translate that?
Do you believe in it?
A fire which never dies. Burning one forever?
Strange!
C Major. Sopranos and altos in thirds. Altos on C. Sopranos above.  Vo-ca, vo-ca me, vo-ca me cum be-ne- dic-tis.
Yes, and on 'dictis'.
Can we see the scene with the music back, please?
Oh, I know that! That's charming!  I didn't know you wrote that.
Of course. The man you accuse yourself of killing.
All Vienna has heard that.
Is it true?
What anger?
Ballet? What ballet?
Yes, absolutely. Is there a ballet in Figaro?
What does he want?
He's not?
Well, yes, but he seems to be more upset by the death of his friend.
Yes.
David says Jack comes to warn him.
Dr. Hirsch, what's wrong? Is this more serious than I know?
Yes.
And what else?
Call me David.
This is absurd. I'm not hungry. I don't want any food.
Closet.
Bathroom.
The bedroom.
The next corner we can get a cab.
Dr. Hirsch will know what to do.
Feeling better?
The doctor will be round later. Would you like a picture book to look at? We have some lovely funny Beanos.
You be quiet, woman, and let me speak.
You've never had bad dreams before?
What about it?
Could be a lot of things.
A coyote.
The Hound of the Baskervilles.
Heathcliffe.
No, but he was on the moors.
Jack?
Where are we going?
David Kessler, this is Gerald Bringsly.
Hello, there. What can I get you?
Sorry, love.
What do you suppose anybody wants? Money, money, money!
What's the matter, Charlie?
I remember once when your account checked.
Most of the creditors I know personally. I've seen them grow up in the community. I knew their fathers and mothers before them.
Thanks.
Good heavens, man! You're not suggesting that I
Why, I couldn't do that . . . !
What?
Now wait a minute, wait a minute...
Why, Cyril, you're insane
Phyllis, you don't have to explain anything.  You'd do well to mind your own business.
That will be just about enough! Now get out of here!
All right. I'll postpone the whole thing until tomorrow night.
Yes?
What's the matter? You don't seem very excited about it.
That's what he says. I got a man from headquarters checking up on it now.
The bank's reputation wouldn't be worth a nickel after that. This is just a flurry, that's all. They've heard about the robbery and got panic-stricken. Listen, get a hold of our available securities and have them turned into cash. Wait a minute. Get my personal stuff and have that turned into cash too. Tell the boys anyone caught arguing with a depositor will be fired on the spot.
Hey, look out, somebody's likely to see us!
Oh, Matt . . .
Listen here, young man - nobody ever called me a liar yet and got away with it
You can ride like that?
These are deeds and mortgages of farms the bank was holding for the railroad.
My plan of lying here pissing myself seems to be working mighty fine, thank you.
But if we take their money and supplies...
'Bout time you got here, buddy.
This isn't a feud, this is war. They've got more men than we do. We kill detectives, they can replace 'em in a day.
Smells funny, it being mentioned in the paper.
What are you saying?
You know, you gettin' caught, right after leaving us, some people thought --
BASTARDS! Come back here and face me!
What the --
Old Man Tucker is just standing quiet outside the bank.
He thinks this is some kind of game!
"Big and older"?
You are a charmer.
And I planned getting you off the hangman's deck --
I'll meet you down there in a few weeks.
Doc Mimms will --
Zee.
You almost ended my career before it began.
I like that.
Relax, Alan. The Army has this all in hand. And Mr. Thaddeus Rains will be very pleased with this news. Nothing like a hanging to motivate the populace to relocate.
Parker.
What is that?
Yes, that's the way to win the locals back to our side.
No, you demand results. They are not the same thing. And if you want results, you will let me do my job as I see fit. Unless of course,  You want this fool to saddle up and take another run at it?
It's a plain end. I think.
You have a really nice place here...Paul. How much did you pay for it?
Why? What's wrong?
Because he dated her.
Girls dig Bateman. He's CQ. You're total CQ, Bateman.
It was a pretty long message, wasn't it?
Van Patten looks puffy. Has he stopped working out?
Yes, Caron's right. Gorbachev's not downstairs. He's at Tunnel.
Okay, Jean. I need reservations for three at Camols at twelve-thirty, and if not there, try Crayons. All right?
Anywhere you want?
Oh Patrick, I can't make this decision.
Oh, I can't.  I don't know.
Yes. I don t think I can...control myself.
Well, I mean, um, it s really...Bosco. You know, like... like a Dove Bar. It's a Dove Bar...Hershey's Syrup?
Listen, John, I've got to go. T Boone Pickens just walked in...  Just joking...  No don't tip the owner of the salon. Okay, John, right, got it.  Sorry about that.
How well did you know him?
I mean they want to get caught.
I'm so hungry.
I'm so hungry.
I lost my job...
Hey, Halberstam?
Why are there copies of the Style section all over the place? Do you have a dog? A chow or something?
Is that a raincoat?
It's important.
What!
What're you -- what?
Are you gonna tell me where you went?
Mr. Barton, do you remember me?
Yes sir. I need to talk to you.
Is it your software?
You know a lot about art, I guess.
Milo. What's up?
No. I just went deeper into the machine. Preferred being the geek to having to explain. Lying would've been worse.
Cause he was a liar. And I hated him.  "Get your head out of that machine, wise up to the real world." The more he mocked me the deeper I went. Cause if being savvy meant being like him --  Guess that's why I'm kind of clueless, even now. Didn't cultivate my conniving side. 'Not sure I even have one.
Help me change the Skywire settings. Add five degrees to each satellite coordinate.
Delbert seems to enter #21 twice. Without leaving the first time.
They just pushed up the schedule on Skywire apps. How fast are you going?
Mine's not the CEO. He barely remembers to take a shower.
Maybe once. I re-wrote it, anyway.
Mmm-more like -- I have a little trouble. Trusting people.
The mainstream media. TV, or a newsmagazine.
We could cross-reference a data base on media ownership. But not on our own computers. Not even at home.
Great. I knocked off the aglet, as soon as I get a passable version of Skywire we're there.
Thank God.
They know I broke in. Alice helped me.  Shrot's not one of them. He's blundering into this on his own.
Hardly anybody does, that's the beauty part. No cameras, the DOJ doesn't bother with it, it's accessed by a tunnel they boast about. You know the best place to hide a leaf?
Oh.
We rented a loft in Sunnyvale.  You know what's the bad part? We can't talk about work anymore. We're competitors! The venture capitalists made us sign like 100 confidentiality forms.
What is it?
There's nothing in this hall. Someone's pulling your chain, as usual.
Do you mind if I ask you a personal question?
Yes.
I'll tell you all in due time, after we make love. But first, tell me another poem.
Hello, Austin, this is Basil Exposition from British Intelligence. Thank you for confirming the link between Dr. Evil and Virtucon. Find out what part Virtucon plays in something called Project Vulcan. I'll need you and Vanessa to get on that immediately.
Hey Austin Powers, it's me, Mick Jagger.
Are you more satisfied now sexually, Austin?
"You can't always get what you want!" That's a great title for a song! I'm gonna write that, and it'll be a big hit.
Brrrr! She must be frigid. There's two things I know about life: one, Americans will never take to soccer. Two, Swedish girls and stewardesses love to shag!  They're shag-mad, man! Let me ask you a question, Vanessa, and be honest.
Do I make you horny?
Do I make you horny? Randy, you know. To you, am I eros manifest?
Listen, Vanessa, I'm a swinger... That's what I do, I swing.
Hello, hello. That's Dr. Evil's cat.
Austin, may I have a word with you?
Listen, I know I'm just being neurotic, but I can't shake this suspicious feeling about that Italian secretary, Ms. Fagina. I mean, I don't want to sound paranoid, but I've had some bad relationships in the past, and I have some jealousy issues. You went to her penthouse. It makes me feel so small to give into these insecurities, but I can't help but feel this weird, irrational, unfocused... well, jealousy. I'm sorry.
I can't believe you made love to her just like that. Did you use protection?
No, did you use a condom?
Not in the Nineties.
Well, it means something to me. If you want us to have a relationship, you've got to be a one-woman man.
It's not what it looks like, Vanessa.  At ease, boys.
I can explain. They attacked me. Gas came out of her...well, and then they... and I...
Noooooooooooooo!
Remember when we froze your semen, you said that if it looked like you weren't coming back to try and make you a son so that a part of you would live forever?
Well, after a few years, we got sort of impatient. Dr. Evil, I want you to meet your son.
But Scott, who's going to take over the world when I die?
Don't you think we should ask for more than a million dollars? A million dollars isn't that much money these days.
I just think, like, he hates me. I really think he wants to kill me.
I so agree. How did you acquire a taste for it?
Close. We're so hush-hush, even we know nothing about it.  Now let's see, there's coconut cake, date and walnut; I recommend the rum baba ...
Who?
Such as?
The result would be ...
Then what's stopping you?
You can but I wish you wouldn't ...
An invitation. To a 'formal picnic'...?
Do you always drive this fast?
But you did suspect me.
You're playing games.
I thought you played by the rules.
I'm playing to win.
Please don't tell me it's how you play the game.
What is it?
When all this is over, we simply must get you out of that suit.
Your mission is simple. Find out how and why these agents died.
'X' marks the spot. The shoes were delivered to ... an island in Hyde Park. Surrounded by the Serpentine. On the site of a former Ministry installation...
Think she really killed those agents?
Amnesia?
Insane ... ?
Why?
You with Mother or Father?
Good. Glad to see they're together at last. They don't get along. Promotion. Top job. Most unfair. Quite a fuss at the Ministry.
What's happening?
What?
Denmark makes great Nautilus equipment.
Shit, shit, shit, shit. My car's gone!
Some fat slob in the next booth is making a lot of noise.
Right.  Hey, shut up. Okay, sir.
Well... twenty-four more hours to go and tonight we'll share with our friends and loved ones the joys of those last moments of singleness.
Wouldn't think of it. Because tomorrow...  We're going to the chapel and we're...
Are you okay?
This has been quite a night. Here's a thought. Why don't we go home and give our private parts a workout?
Congratulations on your daughter's wedding. Who's she marrying?
Let's go.
I hate her. I hate her guts, the bitch.
Are any of those right?
Er... perhaps we ought to stop now.
Excuse me, but this is as arousing as a stroll through the Vatican.
Now, don't get into any trouble.
Thanks a lot, that was the best. You're next.
Well, the first month it's great. The second month things calm down a little. By the third month you're looking through your old girlfriends' phone numbers; by the fourth month you're numb; by the fifth month, hopefully the football season starts.
You know Knowlton pretty well?
You gotta let me finish --
There's only so much technology can do.  Thanks for the beer.
Jesus, it's too damn bright in here... Like a goddamn spotlight... I'm goin' blind...
I saw it.
When dad died, I saw another fire...
I saw it before it got them. I tried to yell, but... He asked me to look out for him. And I didn't do it. I let him die.
I hate him so much sometimes, Stephen. You don't know how hard it was for me to put that uniform on...
Look, I'm not the same girl who had nothing better to do than wrap her legs around you on a Saturday night. This isn't about fun. I'm working here.
Let me tell you something. Martin Swayzak is going to be this town's next mayor.
Why do you think Marty came here tonight? Because he cares about your department. You don't know how hard he works. You don't know about his programs helping West Side --
This is one of the oldest fire stations in the city. Lotta tradition locked up in here. What do you think?
See that trap door up there? That used to lead to the hay loft when they had horse-drawn engines. It was pretty different then... but kinda the same, y'know?
When I came back, I knew more than anything else that I wanted to be a fireman.
Famous story even. Straight burn. Just an engine and truck first on scene. What did you feel, Brian, when you first got there?
You gotta tell a story too, Brian. It's fair. C'mon, don't think too hard --
Right. Light smoke, low roll. Couple'a civilians hollering -- medium deal. So young fireman Adcox and Captain McCaffrey, they head up stairs, get out on the fire escape -- McCaffrey does the ballsy jump across... what were you feeling, Brian?  C'mon, you promised. Be honest.  Okay... Guard!
Very good, Brian. -- About your report here. The way to a torch's heart is through his tools. That's how you know him. It's the way he talks to the fire. And to you if you listen.
That's a probie answer. You're smarter than that, Brian.
Temperature in this room was about 2000 degrees, but copper wire in outlet is melted, which requires 5000 degrees. An accidental short in the plug could of created a spark of 7000 degrees, hot enough to melt the wire and start a fire.
This is the copy of Swayzak's manning report that was released. Everybody on this job knows it's bullshit but we could never argue with the numbers. They're all airtight.
Oh, man, I'm sorry.
So, you surviving without me?
Uh, Helen, I wanted to talk to you a second about Sean...
See that patch of shirt? We wondered about the discoloration so he ran a spectro. On a lucky shot we picked up some traces of Trychticholorate. Nobody around here had ever heard of it.
Probably got in Cosgrove's clothes in a gas state from the fire.
Inspector.
The Church is a fucking racket. I know how they operate. I've been part of the racket since the first time some faggot priest spilt water on my head. My Aunt Lu says I was crying all the way through. Yeah, I know their game inside out. Now I'm free of it and I'm gonna stay that way.
What's to believe?
You took the chalice.
You brought it back to the Church. And then it made it's way back to me, again.
Large?
It's still my money. If you want to have a chance at any part of it, shithead, you will take my $120,000 and bet on tomorrow's game.
Fuck yesterday's game. The World Series is seven games not six. Put in my bet.
How's the case going?
The fucking rapists, man. The punks who raped that nun. The $50,000 reward from the Church! Remember?
Same thing, y'knowwhatI'msayin', y'knowwhatI'msayin'!
You don't have the demographics.
That'swhatI'msayin'.  I'm not blowin' my young career, brother or no brother, for you or anybody else.
If you think I'm a house nigga then that's your prerogative.  You got your ways to affect change, I have mine.  And I would appreciate it very much if you took ya field nigga ass out of my house.
What's wrong with him?
Gentlemen, the show, our show will be satirical.  You know what that is, don't you?  Trust me on this one.
I would like to change your name.
You're now Mantan.
The material you've been creating is too white bread.  White people with black faces.  The Huxtable's, Cosby, revolutionary.  But that's dead.  We can't go down that road again.
Protest finally forced "Amos and Andy" off the air.  Could stop us from ever getting on.
I don't give a good goddamn about Finland, Norway, Sweden or wherever ya blond ass came from.
Funnier to who and at who's expense? Dunwitty, when Negroes start to run amok, the boycotts, when the demostrations commence, I'm giving them your home address.  Let's see how you like it when they picket your lawn in Greenwich, Connecticut.
Dem white boys giving you a hard time?
The truth is never let them seeya sweat.  You do that, that's half the battle.
Three nights Charleston, South Carolina.
Manray was under our nose the whole time.
Just want to say good luck.
DeLa, you should try it sometime. Come into the light.
That which has been hidden in darkness is now in the light.  This bucket of blood.
Can I kiss you too?
You feel good, not nervous?
Not nervous?  Relaxed?
Peerless, your father called.
Myrna is here to help us plan our strategy.
Cousins, I want all of you to go to your windows.  Go to your windows and yell.  Yell, I'm tired of the drugs, the crack babies born out of wedlock to crackhead aids infested parents.  I'm tired of the inflated welfare rolls while good wholesome Americans bring less and less of their paycheck home every two weeks. I'm tired, you're tired, we're all tired of these so-called bible- thumping God fearing, whore mongling Professional athletes.  Aren't you tired of these basketball-dunking, football-running, hop-hip rapping ebonic-speaking sex offenders who got ten kids from ten different Ho's?  I know I am and so is Sleep 'N Eat.
A lot?
And, I'll tell you what, Mr. Dugan, I've been insulted grossly in this house.  I ain't at all satisfied with these here ways of going on. I'm an Englishman, I am, and a man of property; and I -- I --
The captain was the nephew and heir of the Minister of Police, Herr Galgenstein, a relationship which, no doubt, aided in the younger gentlemen's promotion.
What is the service, sir?
I hope to spoil this sport, and trust to see this sword of mine in that big bully's body.
I'll match any man with the sword.
Not against Castle Dugan gate, that has been off the hinges these ten years.
You are the young man who M. de Seebach recommended?
You want my heart?
To make me wretched in two weeks.
The amusing thing is that you deceive me without knowing, if it is true that you love me.
Why are you shaking?
A meeting with the Prince of Turbingen is impossible.
Good night, papa.
Papa?
One of the boys in the stable told Nelly that you've already bought my horse, and that it's at Doolan's farm, where Mick the groom is breaking it in.  Is that true, papa?
Can I at least have a drink?
Yeah, if you've slept.
You framed-him...
Yeah, right...
Hey, Ray! Just had a nice talk with your buddy Kendall -- seems you killed three people!
That'd be my reaction too --
Well, why didn't you say so? We'll just drop all your charges, then --
He -- He made me do it --
Why didn't you tell us all this in the first place?
Jesus, what happened?
Ray, this is my life here. I ain't gonna pretend I'm not happy West is gone, but you know I couldn't have done this. It's not in me.
Mueller.
We're sweeping our area and suddenly he's gone. Couple minutes later, phosphorous grenade pops off about a third of a click away --
That's it. You're that policeman with friends in low places. Tell me, how's Guissepe Torres doing these days? Those racketeering indictments must have really been a downer --
Epileptic attacks are murder on your system. Rattle your internal organs like a paint mixer.
You lied to us, Levi, you're going to the gas chamber unless you tell us where to find them!
Where are they!
MAYBE WHAT --
Pike killed West, Dunbar killed Mueller, Childs, and Nunez.
It was so good, I actually forgot you're one of the bigger dogs now. The Base Commander. The one in control. You couldn't let him testify, could you?
If you let him testify then it would have all come out. West was supposed to take care of it out there, shut Nunez up and then disappear. But it got messy and people got killed. So you called your old pal Tom Hardy, figuring if worse came to worse, he'd cover for you.
I questioned him for three hours and he didn't make a sound. You don't have a badge, he won't talk to you.
Remember, he's the son of a Senator, so go easy. Kid gloves.
I was starting to believe you, you know? That you weren't who everyone said. I guess I was wrong --
So what now?
Think it'll work?
This isn't the time --
What if I don't want it?
Pike, please --
Pike never confessed.
I told him what had really happened to West. Told him to keep quiet about it or I'd destroy him. Because if it came out that I was involved with the whole PX scam, my father would be finished.
Tell him to shut up --
What happens to Dunbar now?
Didn't kill anything, did I?
Or are you too scared?
Then do it.
Fine, you do it.
How old are you?
I'm eight. That means when I'm eighteen, you'll be 28. And when I'm 28, you'll only be 38.
Lord, I'm sorry I...
I'll...
Is it the medicine that's making you thirsty?
The one about the witch.
Did I ever tell you about how...
Where are we headed?
I've been working on this poem for 12 years.
Can I ask you a question? Why did you come here today? If you found this deed, why didn't you just ask Eddie?
I'm going with you.
How is he?
How much time does he have left?
Mom?
What's this?
That's not a burn.
Sorry. You've lost me...
She says she has a secret to tell.
He wants a lot of money.
He wants the money from your bank.
You don't understand. He wants all the money that is in your bank.
I don't understand.
Give me some money.
Excuse me?
You are throwing me out.
You know you can come under the blanket.
My name's Sophia.
This was very sweet of you.
And, sir... do you have a size in mind for what you're lookin' for?
YOU HAD A PLAN! YOU HAD A GODDAMN LIFE! AND SHE JUST FUCKED THE GUTS OUT OF YOU!
Better?
Don't... don't say that to me...
Gal, you ain't right yet.
How you let men treat ya like they do?
These men you up under. How you let them do ya like that?
You know what I'm talkin' about.  All that mess with ya teachers and... boys in the backs of trucks.
Cuz once in a while soil need a change. Corn take up a lot of nitrate in the fertilizer. So next crop what ya do is plant ya some soy beans. That give off a lot of nitrate. Change keeps it all growin' and growin' strong.  Sting a bit?
Means ya healin'.  So all this farmin' make me think on Matthew. Matthew 13. The parable of the sower? Man toss seed on rock, on the wayside, some fell in thorns... you know the story?
My life is gone. Only life I was livin'. And I lost it.
Sorry.
How a girl get like that?
Good. Makin' steaks for supper. I expect you to come.
You treat folks special when they company. It's just supper, R.L., shit.
Keep the change on that.
I think it'd be better if you talk to me.
You got any money?
I said we wasn't gonna talk about him.
Save that hustle talk to them field ballers you sell crack to.
... I found the goombah... Cavello. He's --
Whoa, I knew you were going to say that.  I absolutely anticipated that, Nick.  But I said to myself, Charlie, Charlie, we can move up on this, so go find Nicklaus... He'll be pissed for a moment, but then it'll dawn on him --
Nick, have I been a good partner?
... He's a sorry old guy, but I like him.
Where're you going, Ichiro?
Know her?
Yakuza.
What's in the box?
You know, Nick, we can't lose.
Don't be an ass.
I still think you're a bastard.
You and Charlie are taking the Jap home, tonight.
Check your gun before you leave. They're not allowed in Japan.  It's a nice, safe country.
Your plane leaves at six.  Two officers will escort you.
You had my help, detective.
-- Do you know where she is, detective?  Do you know how to find her?  Even where to start?  We will find them.
We're not used to the big city. Where we come from it's not so easy to get lost.
The facts of life.  I'll be blunt. To make an alteration in the evolvement of an organic life system, at least by men, makers or not, it fatal.  A coding sequence can't be revised once it's established.
Because by the second day of incubation any cells that have undergone reversion mutation give rise to revertant colonies -- like rats leaving a sinking ship.  The ship sinks.
We have a lot in common.
Not only that, but we have smiliar problems.  Accelerated decrepitude. But we don't want to die quite yet.
You could help us.
Six, huh?
What was he after?
It's gotta be right for my customer.
You want to see my friends?
What's that?
This one looks familiar, but I don't know.  Naw.  There's one came in today looks a little like this one but...
Who?
Nothing.  She wanted to know about suck night.
I didn't know if I wanted to handle her -- I already got a snake act.  But my partner goes down there to the Opera House on suck night to book the good ones.
That's what we call in the trade, audition free-for- alls and most of it sucks. Bit I don't think that's her.
It seems your department doesn't believe out new unit is to the public benefit.
You use your equipment, don't you?
Do you dream?
Don't leave here.  Don't open the door, don't answer the phone.
How many questions does it usually take, Mr. Deckard?
How come you were in my truck?
Methuselah Syndrome.
My glands.  They grow old too fast.
We want you to come with us so we can talk some more about your experiences.
My office.
Well, that depends...
Get out of here!
So for four thousand dollars, all I have to do is drive you to your hotel?
And that's it?
I don't have to take a physical in your space ship?
I knew this would happen!  You're like a lost puppy!
We'll have to rent a refrigerated truck for the beef and poultry.
I guess we'll need another locker.
Here you go.  One champagne cocktail.
I thought only hookers drank those things.
Hey, Eve!
Yep.  You know, my father -- who is a scientist -- says that everything is a miracle. Everything. Until recently I wasn 't sure what he meant by that.
I certainly do!
No it's not!
Then just help me find a girlfriend! That's all I ask. I'll give you every single card I've got left!
Would you do it just because you're my friend? My very best friend.
Yeah.  Could be.  Go say hello, Romeo. Looks like a healthy non-mutant to me.
Adam...dumb question, but humor me. Have you ever had sex before?
I've got almost everything we need! And this nice man...
Adam...don't forget...don't forget ...
...the pipe tobacco.
Well, we try. Listen, let me just ask you a few questions.  When did Alaska become a state?
Who use to own it?
When did we get it from them?
What's the capitol?
Hello! It's Anchorage!  Gotcha!
Okay, Troy!  Let's get those all-beef frozen patties!
You bet!
What?
No, I wouldn't go in one of those places with a gas mask on.
Does that work?
Hello.
I don't know how far you'll have to travel to find supplies, but if you can't get home by nightfall, I want you to look for something called a Holiday Inn. Write that down. It's a hotel. There might still be one standing.
According to Caltech, this Webber guy was a bonafide genius and a borderline nutcase.
Unless we get a postcard or somethin', that's my guess.
All back East.
He drank it hot?
Good god.
Home sweet home!
Calvin?!
We looked all over for you. What are you doing back here?
Why?
Very nice. Unless it caved in, too.
Let's eat our cake.
And Lord we ask finally that you send an angel to look after and protect our beloved son, Adam.  Amen.
So, Adam...where on earth are you from?
Just be yourself.
I don't think so.
I'm going to need two more banana- splits and a cherry coke!
Doctor Gynde, my whole family's sick. What's going on?
By the way, Jeffrey, this story isn't going to the press and I'm going to ask you to consider all you've heard strictly confidential. Do not discuss this business with anyone, but me, or other police personnel. Got it?
For now. Alright, you better be. And Sandy better not be involved with this, I can tell you. Be prepared to come in for further interrogation on this later.
Don't.  I don't like that. What do you want?
Sure I'm alright. 
Why are you here. Whatiya want?
I looked for you in my closet tonight.  It's crazy, I don't know where you came from, but I like you.
What do you want to do?
Are you a bad boy?
Do you want to do bad things?  Anything, anything.
I want you to hurt me.
Oh no.
Look at these. What are these?
Don't be a good neighbor to her or I'm gonna send you a love letter. Straight from my heart, fucker. You know what a love letter is? It's a bullet, straight from my gun, fucker. Once you get a love letter from me, you're fucked forever. Understand, Fuck?
Hello, uh, my name is Jeffrey Beaumont. Is Detective Williams in?
I just wanted to ask him a few questions, that's all. Maybe I better go.
Hi Dad.
I guess I'll see you sometime.
I'll tell Mike I'm sick. There's a game tonight anyway and he'll never miss me. Afterwards he can go out with the guys. Just so the record is kept straight though, I love Mike. What do want me to do?
I already know. The "Slow Club". It's on Route 7.
Yeah, but don't pick me up. My father may think it's strange. I'll walk over to your house. I'll be there at eight o'clock.
No, silly - I'm still in school you know. But I'll meet you after school and you can tell me what you've learned. You better be careful, Jeffrey.
What was that all about?
It's good to see you.
Just go over to Gelford and up to Vista. It's not far. Can you tell me any more about what you learned?
It's okay.
Thank you. Whatiya say we just enjoy the evening?
Look Jeffrey.
There's ways around that.
Poppa Joe said there was only two. In and out.  Boy, you guys sure did a good job. You're good, huh? Cool masks. Where'd you get them?
Yeah, well...
You little fuck. Let him go. I'll drop you right here.
Let him go or I will deliver you, right now. 
Yeah, we promise.
I do believe the Monsignor finally got a point.
How do you think he figured all this out without talking to us?
That was way easier than I thought.
On TV ya always get that asshole that jumps behind the couch.
Oh, we're good man.
He isn't to be touched.
Only two did the shooting.  So what are you thinking, Russian retaliation?
Now stay with me, boys. What did they do to make two such identical wounds? Did one guy put him on his knees, pop a cap in, sit him back up and shoot him again the same way? No. Two men of similar height dropped this guy down, each put some iron to his head and boom! That's all she fuckin' wrote!
Uh.  Shit, I, uh...
Right now.
Liberating isn't it?
Hello? You there?
I wouldn't have, uh, killed you, Father.  Dominus Ominus. Remember, you're bound. You can't talk about this... to anyone.
Now that window can never be locked. It's impossible.
Is it back in?
What about what that guy said?
Dignan, I can't get my hair cut. That's just not possible, all right?
See, one day we were playing hot box over at my next door neighbor Mr. Langston's house and Anthony fell in the pool and got knocked unconscious. I had to dive in and save him.
Mr. Langston performed cardiopulmonary recitation. CPR. I've never said this before, but frankly I thought Anthony was dead. The veins in his face were all sticking out. His skin was blue. He truly did look dead.
I wish I'd been there.
Applejack would of got him anyway. This was just the quicker way.
Shit, Dignan.
I don't know, Dignan. You went crazy.
I'm in position, Scarecrow.
Not at all. The place is totally deserted.
I've got a great view up here. I can see all the --
Come on.
What?
What are you talking about?
There's not enough time.
So how is it in there? 
I'd like to live in that place. Hinckley Cold Storage.
I'll tell you, Anthony. Times like this I get philosophical. What does it mean? What's it all about? Are you afraid to die?
No, that door over there.
Are you afraid?
Exactly. Woah.
The fear of death, The pain of consciousness.  Did you mix this martini?
Bob. Bob. That's a palindrome.  I love palindromes.
Are you serious?
What?
You OK, Bob?
Does my skin feel soft, Anthony?
Wait. Did he see us?
You stole a Trans-Am.
OK, Bob.
Well. What do you want to do? You want to steal one or just drive your car?
I paid for it.
Way to go, Bob!
What do you mean get back?
Bob, that makes no sense.
This could be a trap.
Don't "Come on, Dignan" me.
Not in that car you're not.
Come on!
Jesus Christ. What the fuck is that?
How you doing, Bob?
Join the party, fellas.
Guess I'll get another Tecate.
What?
Treadstone.
That's not gonna fly.
Sit down.
I don't exactly know what to say -- I'm sorry.
I'm not a traitor. I've served my ountry.
Why not? It was just money.
Had to be done.
In the end, honestly, it's hubris. Simple hubris. You reach a point in this game when the only satisfaction left is to see how clever you are.
It was my job. My first time. Your father was supposed to be alone. But then your mother, she came out of nowhere...  I had to change my plan.  You understand me?  You don't have to live like that anymore. Thinking that.
Try again.
But you're sure?
So...
See that tram coming around the corner?
What do you want?
Looks like he's been detained.
There's only a Consulate, they sent a field officer out half an hour ago --
I'm here. So is Donnie and Jack Weller. We understand you're using the full allocation for this buy?
It's a lot of money, Pam.
Still...
What do you think? Is he coming in?
What are they doing?
He won't come.
No, M'lord.
Stephen ready?
You'll move
I have faced him. Have you?
Knowing his passion for his lost love, they next plotted to take him by desecrating the graves of his father and brother and setting an ambush at the grave of his wife. He fought his way through the trap and carried her body to a secret place! Now that is romance, Oui?
M'lady... what kindness of you to visit a stranger.
Will he show mercy to my country? Will he take back his soldiers, and let us rule ourselves?
Mrs. Treborn! I need to speak with you!
Righty-tighty, lefty-lucy.
Why do you ask?
Best not bitch up. Wind up someone's luggage that way.
It's a little complicated. I haven't seen results exactly like these before.
Whasamatter? Lost your Rolex?
Welcome home. Thought you might like some fresh air for a change.
What do you think it is about us that makes us so perfect? Like, looking back, whatever gave you the nerve to sneak out and visit me after I moved away?
So how's tricks? Sorry, occupational humor.
Oh, I'm sorry. Does my line of work make you uncomfortable, precious?
Ha! Where's that?
We're really gonna be in a movie!?
I was praying this curse would have ended with me.
There is no "right". When you change who people are, you destroy who they were.
Most guys tuck their porn under here, but all you have are... comp books.
What do you need it for? I don't get you lately.
What?
Destroy it?
Mom. Don't cry. I can change this.
Monsieur Rick?
Such a bargain. But that is your decision?
Excuse me, Monsieur Rick, but a gentleman inside has won twenty thousand francs. The cashier would like some money.
I am so upset, Monsieur Rick. You know I can't understand --
Ah, to get out of Casablanca and go to America! You're a lucky man.
Hmmm. I happen to know that he gets ten percent. But he's worth twenty- five.
Of course they stay. Rick's wouldn't be Rick's without them.
Mademoiselle, after this disturbance it is not safe for Laszlo to stay in Casablanca.
That is also true, except for one destination, to return to occupied France.
Uh huh. Under a safe conduct from me.
There are only two other alternatives for him.
It is possible the French authorities will find a reason to put him in the concentration camp here.
But be serious, darling. You are in danger and you must leave Paris.
Yes, of course, we --
No, no. Not at my hotel. I, uh, I have things to do in the city before I leave. I'll meet you at the station, huh?
I told you this morning you'd come around, but this is a little ahead of schedule. Well, won't you sit down?
You use "Richard" again? We're back in Paris.
Your unexpected visit isn't connected by any chance with the letters of transit? It seems that as long as I have those letters I'll never be lonely.
I went through all that with your husband. It's no deal.
Do I have to hear again what a great man your husband is? What an important cause he's fighting for?
I'm saying it because it's true. Inside of us we both know you belong with Victor. You're part of his work, the thing that keeps him going. If that plane leaves the ground and you're not with him, you'll regret it.
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon, and for the rest of your life.
We'll always have Paris. We didn't have, we'd lost it, until you came to Casablanca. We got it back last night.
Goodnight.
Did he give any reason?
Ask me?
I'm afraid Major Strasser would insist.
Well, this might come in handy.
Had a close one, eh?
Let us say that it is my request. That is a much more pleasant word.
I'm sure you'll excuse me if I am not gracious, but you see, Major Strasser, I'm a Czechoslovakian.
Good evening, gentlemen.
I strongly suspect that Ugarte left the letters of transit with Mr. Blaine. I would suggest you search the cafe immediately and thoroughly.
You give him credit for too much cleverness. My impression was that he's just another blundering American.
The plane to Lisbon.  You would like to be on it?
Yeah, you were saying?
How can you close me up? On what grounds?
If you don't mind, you fill in the names. That will make it even more official.
I understand you came here from Paris at the time of the occupation.
Are you one of those people who cannot imagine the Germans in their beloved Paris?
One moment. Tonight I'll be selling those for more money than even I have ever dreamed of, and then, addio Casablanca! You know, Rick, I have many friends in Casablanca, but somehow, just because you despise me you're the only one I trust. Will you keep these for me? Please.
Perhaps an hour, perhaps a little longer.
It took this test package thirty-two hours to get from Seattle to St. Petersburg, a distance of nine thousand miles.  And then it took forty-one hours to get from our warehouse in St. Petersburg to here, a distance of, what --
You're putting off the inevitable.
I float.  You sink.  End of story.
It's a fucking soccer ball, you idiot.
Our apologies that it never made it to the recipient.
How was Russia?
Don't overwhelm me with details, you know how I hate that.  Did you get it fixed?
This isn't working out.
"We're" not over-reacting.
No.
Her name's Hannah.
I've got to get back to Memphis. Hannah's babysitter has finals.
Need some help?
Look, I help take care of the place.  You got my check, didn't you Mom?
Kamal is not here.
It is Ibrim, I, I am a sorter.
Kamal is not here.  We are very defused.
Hello?
You've been over the line and you came back.  You've been saved, hallelujah!
It's not ergot, it's not pituitary extract, it's not oil of rue...
I suppose it wouldn't hurt to *meet* him. What's his name again?
How about him not needin' the friggin' compass! How about that?
You have to come to my dad's lobster pound and see one, then.
What are you so crazy about the movies for?
At least you were never lonely.
We should take her to St. Cloud's. That much is obvious, isn't it? Let her make up her mind when she gets there...
This came for you a couple of days ago. Olive asked me to bring it. With everything happening, I guess she forgot.
Wally thinks apples are boring.
You said, "Apples aren't exactly flying."
I don't know! He's just leaving--  you're the one who says he needs to see the world!  *That's* what he'll do--he'll see the world!
Don't get too excited, Fuzzy.
At what altitude?
Are we supposed to be up here? The rules said...
Merthiolate, ether, vulval pads, gauze--lots of gauze.
Where's the name sheet?
I am not a doctor.
There's a little something wrong with it. Just this part here--the right ventricle. It's slightly enlarged.
Who cares?
Shit. We don't know what he is.
Ain't you gonna see what it is, Homer?
That what happen--you lost you only daughter so's you killed yourself! That's what we say, all right.
Rose Rose has runned away!
Uh, right... And that was it. That's when we decided to start our own business. No more shithead bosses.
It can erase all those things about you that you wish didn't exist.
Nice.
Ten is standard, sir.
Jake...
You gotta be kidding me. Her?
You'll be there?
Calls?
How much?
What do you need from me? Permission? Go! If you can fleece him for two million, then do it, Kid.
Stake you?
Special Agent Gunther Moonan. Ring a bell?
I can't be here! You understand? I can't --
No.  What's my cut?
What do I have to do?
Look at you... You want to go.
I think you'd do it for free. You're almost drooling. You like the rush.
Why? Your mother not breast feed you or something?
Do you have something to prove?
I'm your basic underachiever. Can't stand working and porn doesn't seem like a good option.
Whatever. But you... I get the feeling you could have bullshitted your way into anything. So why this?
It's more than that.
So that was my part? Smile and shake my ass?
How do you know I will?
Jesus... Take it easy.
Yeah.
It never worked before because A, they didn't flush the bank enough; B, their corporate papers were for shit; C, they didn't have someone on the inside with Customs.
Then what do you want to do, Miles? Run?
Yeah, well we never had this kind of problem before.
We're getting a little old for running.
Excuse me? I believe you're holding something far me under Pearson.
What's up with you? Bladder infection?
Still time.
If you Feds are so hot for him, why don't we just bring him in right now?
Hope so. Those fucking orthodontist bills are killing me. One fifty every time they tighten those bitches up. One fifty! It's not even covered.
The Indian rope-trick.
Not like Matt, you mean.
I thought it was you. It's the hair!
Right.  Look, I must get back to Habib.
You really are a beautiful woman.
When you get home, I'm asleep. When I leave home, you're asleep.
Aren't you ever tempted to gamble?
I can just imagine, being around so much money all the time...
Really?
I've lived there.
I'm in trouble.
I owe a lot of money.
I know that. But you can now.
Is it yes?
Nice car. How much did you pay for it?
Hey Jack, join us.
Don't worry, I won't report you!
Where did you go to school?
Let me just run through a few things. As a dealer you never gamble, not anywhere. We'll need your picture.
For the database. It can be accessed by every casino in the country. We have the same system for punters.
Ever?
How do you feel, Jack?
We've got to disarm the bomb.
Well, bomb, we have about sixty seconds to drop. Just wondering if everything is all right. Have you checked your platinum euridium energy shielding?
Swell. Let's synchronize detonation time. Do you know when you're supposed to go off?
All right, I have detonation time at... Wait a minute, something's wrong with the clock.  All right, I have detonation time at... no, that can't be right, it says three years.  Okay, I have six minutes exactly. Does that check out down there?
Hello, bomb, are you with me?
Are you willing to entertain a few concepts?
Commander Powell would have named it.
You know what I think about, Talby?
It's funny, but I kind of sit around, you know, a lot of time to myself...
I can't talk to the others, but with time to myself, I think about back home, back home at Malibu. I used to surf a lot, Talby. I used to be a great surfer.
The waves at Malibu and Zuma were fantastic in the springs Talby. I can remember running out on the beach early spring mornings with my board and a wet suit...
Waves would be peaking really high and glassy. Hit that water. Ridin' the wall just perfect.
Commander Powell? Commander, hello!
Sorry, sir, you faded out there for a minute.
What were you saying, Commander, about the bomb?
You're attractive, you're smart.  Stand on your own two feet, know what I mean? And you got a wicked sense of humor. Man, you really zinged the boss a couple times, it was all I could do--
Move it.
Out there.
I made you coffee.  That oughta help you cope with the injustice of the world a little.
What makes you cry?
Pretty much the same reasons I was crying.  But things will be better when we move to a new place.
Ever notice how cats always seem to turn up around dinner time?
Christmas is a snap when you got no parents or relatives, just a bunch of gene sequences from probably twenty different people.
You said you could help.
What's in it for you?
I already don't like the sound of this.
That's low, but this effects me how exactly?
Yeah, I catch your hacks.  He's Satan's lap dog, or something.
I didn't make it this far by attracting a lot of attention.
Know where I can find her?
But she does work here?
I need to talk to her.
Guy says he made the trade in Gillette, Wyoming sometime in the fall of oh-nine.
Then what?  That's it.  That's all I got.
Morning, Sunshine...
At least he didn't swing with your ride.
Look, you're a player... I'm bringing you this on a plate, and my fee is just the normal cost of doing business.
You blew off your girlfriend last night, even though it was the big one-oh.  I'd be pissed off too if I was her.
Thanks, miss.
Right, well, thanks for the drinks and stuff, Amanda, but there's no reason for me to stick around these parts anymore.
Huh?
Oh, Dicky, I c-c-can't...
I-I c-can't...
Ann Arbor isn't... that far from Cleveland, right?
Well, the least we, his only buds in the world, can do is take him along with us tonight and give him one last curl before he starts serving his sentence.
Shit, that dork is Jam.
Now, how are we gonna do this?
Do you realize the sheer, goddamn, unadulterated, undiluted, no holds barred, one hundred percent pure as Ivory Snow, absolutely friggin' STUPIDITY of what you just did?
Cool.
Don't be a fembot. So, are you like grounded because of last night, or what?
I'm sorry, guys. I thought it was a nice thing to do.
Mom, what're we...?
Trip, a female gynecologist does not a lesbian make. And even if it did, at least my mom didn't give birth to me while she was on LSD.
About fuckin' time if you ask me. I'm just going through the motions till I drop out anyway.
Please, sir, don't kick my ass! I'll do anything to get out of a beating!
I feel bad for his family.
Did you tell them that I flooded the school?
That's not what I heard. Now they think I did it.
Wanna walk me home?
It's like this big force... that's in your brain. But sometimes it grows bigger... and it spread down into your arms and legs... and it just sends you someplace.
No. Every time I wake up somewhere different. Sometimes my bike is laying there next to me. Like once when I woke up on the edge of this cliff up on Carpathian Ridge.
So, we call them... IMGs.
Yeah. So the idea is that... you buy these glasses for your infant, and they wear them at night when they sleep.
Is that a cellar door?
So how was school today?
Good Lord.  So the construction guys say it'll take about a week to fix the roof. Damn airline better not fuck us on the shingle match.
Know what?
No... apparently they can't tell us what happened yet. Something about a matching serial number that got burned.  But I had to sign a form saying I wouldn't talk to anyone about it.
What's "Cellar Door"?
And they grow out of our stomachs?
Whoa, Elizabeth. A little hostile, there. Maybe you should be the one in therapy. Then Mom and Dad can pay someone two hundred dollars an hour to listen to all of your thoughts... so we won't have to.
If that's what you think is necessary.
Christ. Is that an axe?
How did this happen?
What is this shit?
Oh, Mom's okay. They're just givin' her a ride back. She almost blew outta the back of Loretta's pick-up on the way over.
I'm lucky I have an after-school job where I can practice my talent.
Ow!
If you're gettin' at somethin', you better just say it.
Well, uh, I'm cuttin' out early today to do a little duck huntin'... but, uh, maybe I could call you tonight.
Okay... well, bye.
Well, it's all happenin' so fast. Goodness-gracious, it hardly seems real, y'know? I mean, I won! I'm the winner! I'm going to State!
Yah -- she's damn near as good as that little black fella -- with the glass eye.
Oh! What is it?
Mom, I just finished the third movement of that concerto I was working on. I put, like, this techno beat on this Japanese folk tune -- wanna hear it?
Oh, I almost forgot...  I got my acceptance to Tokyo University.
Who to?
My card.
Why wasn't I insulted?
Then I demand an apology!
You've got a brain after all - and how you get along without it is amazing to me -- Now, who can I insult?...  Who do we owe money to?...  AMBASSADOR TRENTINO!  How about him?
Why didn't his niece slap your face?
With a gun like that you can kill some of your own men.
Anything else? 
Fine.  We'll throw in the matches before we make the delivery.  By the way, how're you fixed for spys?
So! -- He's on your side, too.
That's even a greater honor.
I'll keep the greetings -- but you can send back the good will... what we need right now is twenty million dollars.
Well, in the meantime, could you let me have $50 personally?
I'll tell you what I'll do.  I'll give you Mrs. Teasdale as security.  or my jackknife.  If you want my advice, you'll take the jackknife... I've a better proposition...  Make it $25 and I'll give you a first mortgage on my son and I hope you foreclose.
In choosing you, I feel that I serve my country well.  I heartily endorse everything you stand for.
The future of Freedonia rests upon you.  Promise me you will follow in my husband's footsteps.
Why - er -- my husband passed away...  I was with him to the very end.
Your Excellency!
I -- I may be wrong, but I suspect the Secretary of War.
I said - I suspect the Secretary of War.
But -
If only we can get his Excellency to listen to reason...
Perhaps you're just polishing a stone, endowing this Elephant Man with qualities he doesn't possess?
Don't!
A hospital is no place for secrecy, Mr. Treves. Doctors spiriting hooded figures about are liable to cause comment. Why wasn't this patient properly admitted, and why is he in isolation? Is he contagious?
Why isn't he in the General Ward, then?
Deformed? Is that it. Then am I to assume that he is ultimately incurable?
What are your plans then, Treves... You are aware that the London does not accept incurables. The rules are quite clear on that point.
Oh, is he a friend of yours?
Can you imagine what his life has been like?
How long has this man been here?
Have you read it?
What? Oh! I see! It's St. Phillips. Oh, of course. Why... why that's very good, I mean you've gotten the windows and arches just right.
But it's so good, I mean... it's so very good.
...Yes potatoes... but...
Good morning, John.
Mr. Treves! Treves.
Good Lord, Mr. Treves!
Parrots can do as much, Mr. Treves. It's all very nice, but I don't see the point. You know they won't let him stay here.
Open up! I know you're in there!
Please! Please! What are those?
Those things in your hands.
And thanks for the Cloak Invisible!
But... How is it you can see me?  You can all see me?
What's the matter, don't you WANT to hear our singing?
You don't think our singing's going to be good enough for you?
A lot of people like our singing.
But you don't want to hear it.
He's trying to stop us waking the Gods.
Because that's how he makes his money, by war and plunder!
He wants to kill US!
You don't know Halfdan the Black.
Have you tried to ask the God for anything?
Let's hack her to pieces.
Slower! Nobody can row at that speed!
You must help us.
Fenrir the Wolf covers the sun -- men fight and kill each other the whole time.
Because... you're... you're the Gods....
Weren't we supposed to?
Well, what else do we do?
I AM one, Dad!
It can't do you any HARM...
Aaagh!
Are you going to let Erik wake the Gods?
We're being attacked! KILL! Kill! Kill!
I must KILL! Kill!
Well... I'm game.
I remember you turned around. Your face was dark and your hair was backlit -- I could see a halo of frizz -- you asked me if things were okay between Naomi and me.
I remember.
Yeah, you told me that later.
It's so cool. You're by far the most sensational person in the room.
Really?
Aw, c'mon, live dangerously. Take the leap and assume someone is talking to you in an otherwise empty car.
Thanks very much. That was very nice of you.
You're really nice. I'm sorry I yelled at you before about it. God, I'm an idiot.
I like you. That's the thing about my psychic thing. I think that's my greatest psychic power, that I get a sense about people. My problem is I never trust it. But I get it. And with you I get that you're a really good guy.
And, anyway, you sell yourself short. I can tell. There's a lot of stuff going on in your brain. I can tell. My goal... can I tell you my goal?
What's the goal, Joel?  My goal, Joel, is to just let it flow through me? Do you know what I mean? It's like, there's all these emotions and ideas and they come quick and they change and they leave and they come back in a different form and I think we're all taught we should be consistent. Y'know? You love someone -- that's it. Forever. You choose to do something with your life -- that's it, that's what you do. It's a sign of maturity to stick with that and see things through. And my feeling is that's how you die, because you stop listening to what is true, and what is true is constantly changing. You know?
Like I wanted to talk to you. I didn't need any more reason to do it. Who knows what bigger cosmic reason might exist?
You're very nice. God, I have to stop saying that. You're nervous around me, huh?
I'm nervous. You don't need to be nervous around me, though. I like you. Do you think I'm repulsively fat?
Let me drive you home.
Joely...
Do you know The Velveteen Rabbit?
Joel!
Hi there.
I do sort of live with somebody though.
I don't know. What if it breaks?
Hi, Naomi, it's Joel.
How's it going?
I know. I had to take the day to think.
I just got in.
Gotta get home. How could she do this to me? How could she not care about what we meant to each other. What a fuck! What a fucking monster she is!
Clementine.
So you don't mind?
Stan... c'mon...
It's just... y'know... I mean...
No way. I can handle this.
Mary...
Order me a pastrami for after?
Thanks.
Stan? What's going on?
Okay, what happened right before he disappeared?
Well, where was Patrick?
Jesus. All right, what's the address.
This book -- It's essential that people read it because --  -- It's the truth. And only I know it.
I'm a friend of Bonanza Jellybean's.
Oh? Well, there's been some trouble on the ranch. I came up here to get out of the way. It's so dark now I doubt if I could find my way back down. If you could help...
Well, if the Clock People give you any inside information on the end of the world, drop us a postcard.
......Delores zonks out on peyote at least once a week, but so far her Third Vision hasn't happened. Niwetkame, the Mother Goddess has not gotten back in touch with her. Meanwhile she and Debbie are rivaling each other like a couple of crosstown high schools. Tension. Cowgirl tension! What a drag.
Debbie says that if women are to take charge again, they must do it in the feminine way; they mustn't resort to aggressive and violent masculine methods. She says it is up to women to show themselves better than men, to love men, set good examples for them and guide them tenderly toward the New Age. She's a real dreamer, that Debbie-dear.
Going north?
Sissy, don't play dumb with me! You're a good model but a shitty actress. The cowgirls are involved in this whooping crane disappearance. You know perfectly well they are. Last seen in Nebraska. Didn't make it to Canada. Siwash Lake is between Nebraska and Canada. The cowgirls have possession of Siwash Lake. And who else but Jellybean's wild cunts could possibly conceive of doing something so diabolical as to tamper with the last flock of some nearly extinct birds? How much do you know about it? Have they murdered those cranes the way they murdered my moo cows?
From what?
Damn, Dr. Weir, don't scare us like that. Coffee?
Coffee.
He's a rescue technician. Peters, medical technician. DJ...
Do you hear it? Right there.
It sounds like "ex infera:" "ex," from; "infera," the ablative case of "inferi." "Hell."
That ship was lost in deep space, seven years ago. If the Titanic sailed into New York harbor, I'd find it more plausible.  Houston wants Aerospace to send out a search and rescue team, investigate the source of the transmission. If it really is the Event Horizon, they'll attempt a salvage.  We need you to prepare a detailed briefing on the ship's systems for the salvage crew...
I've reached another containment door. This thing's huge...
We've got pressure.
Can anybody hear me...
Peters...
Dr. Weir, I need you on the bridge.
Once the ship is secured, we'll bring you on board --
I want this room sealed. The Second Containment is off limits.
What about my ship?
You... You can't do that!
Jesus...
Captain Miller...
Where is it, where is it...
What's the point? I'll just get the same thing...
I can reconfigure the scan for C-12, amylase proteins.
I'm on my way, Starck.
Claire...
We have to do something, oh God...
I can't believe this, I haven't gotten more than my hand in six weeks and now this shit. Why not Mars, Cap, Mars has women...
Relativity, yes. We can't break the law of relativity, but we can go around it. The ship doesn't really move faster than the speed of light; it creates a dimensional gateway that allows the ship to instantaneously "jump" from one point in the universe to another, light years away.
In our current environment, Dr. Weir, self-control is an asset.
You don't know what it's like out there. Walking around like some kind of circus freak. People staring, whispering --
I mean...
What are you doing here?
About me? How sweet.
What did you wish for, honey?
The shields on the station should protect us.
Okay. I've uh, got some questions, from Sue. That she thought might be better coming from me... Can you, you know, go to the bathroom... like normal...
Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask --
What's wrong with me?
Me like-y.
I though we went over this.
Back it down, Johnny!
Stop it.
I'm sorry, sis, for leaving you guys --
Make sure you find Ben, bring him back here. And keep it quiet. I don't need this to hit the press.
Front page?
Uh, Sue...? I can't.
Reed. I was ready for the next step, you weren't, ergo, I walked.
You know, I bribed the projectionist ten bucks to keep it open late?
Got it. So take a walk, Ben... I'm going to borrow Susan for a second.
Surprised I agreed to Reed's proposal?
Please don't make this personal --
Go ahead. Just make it quick.
Mom says to clean up the pool.
Your friends use the pool. Your friends messed it up.
I take out the garbage.
Any problems?
I can't wait until I can drive next year. I walk every day. It's such a drag.
Sometimes I get a ride with my brother. But he usually works in the mornings, and then drives to school himself.
I want you to know that it's your final decision if we should continue or not.
Do you ever look at those girls who work at Swenson's? They're beautiful. And I have to stand out here and watch them six nights a week.
Damone, are you there?
All right, what you want to do is go to the Free Clinic and tell the doctor that you have sex regularly -- several times a week -- and that you need Nornel One Plus Fifty's.
Not if you're over sixteen.
What the fuck is this guy doing?
I can't believe I start high school tomorrow.
I should quit this job. I'm going to get so fat working here... nobody will ever take me out.
You have been acting very strange the last few weeks.
Hey! Wait a minute! There's no birthday party for me here!
I couldn't make it in time.
I don't know, mon. The food lines took forever.
You look like you could still be in high school.
What's your other question?
I had a really nice time tonight.
Yeah? About fifty people I didn't know wrote that in my annual.
Let's have lunch!
Cut their goddamn heads off. Every one of them. That's what we're doing in California.
"One toke over the line, sweet Jesus."
Savage Henry has cashed his check! We're going to rip his lungs out!
Total control now. Tooling along the main drag on a Saturday night in Vegas, two good old boys in a fire apple red convertible... stoned, ripped, twisted... Good people!
Look, what are we doing here? Are we here to entertain ourselves, or to do the job?
Yeah... I thought we might need it...
You bastard! You'd do that, wouldn't you?
You cheap honky sonofabitch...
The cops?
I saw these bastards in Easy Rider, but I didn't believe they were real. Not like this. Not hundreds of them!
Man, I know these people in my goddamn blood!
This is a fucking nightmare.
What is this?
I was stupid with shock -- not knowing whether to run or start laughing.
The password is: "One Hand Washes The Other." The minute you hear that, you say "I fear nothing."
Oh Lord! I'd do just about anything for that!
You know where it is?
I have a CB in my truck, we could get some help out here.
That's the oldest of the bunch, looked like the Grandpapa. We caught the little one, Junior, in the cooler there. As we've seen, what he lacks in size he more than makes up for in speed.
We just smeared a skunk.
I'm telling ya, you got the cloth too deep, you're asking for it.
My truck can't be more than ten feet away. We load into the back, I can get in the front and we roll out of here.
How much you got to see the show?
This one will just stun ya, but this one will put ya to sleep.
Got 'cha!
COME ON!
Okay, well... anybody else have an idea?
There's a rifle and a shotgun here.
You know you don't have to do this.
I admire your strength.
Well... you could always dump her, Mr. Bebe. Teach her a lesson. There are a million beautiful girls out there who don't give a damn about politics.
Oh. I mean, good.
Face it! Confess it! You're weak!
You're afraid!
You don't want to show your whole soul -- ugly, mis-shapen, and pitiful -- you don't want to show it --
Hey, where's the fire, sister?
Cool off, beautiful. Didn't you see the sign says "Dimout Zone?"  There's a war on, you know?
Harry? Oh Harry, I knew you'd come. I love you, Harry. I love... Take me home, Harry.
I love you, Mama.  I love you, Dad.
I'm going back to the hotel.
See you next weekend?
Momma told ya not to speak to strangers, huh?  Hey!
Not bad. But come on, Harry; what's the real reason?
Yeah, I read about that. Terrible business, suicide.
What?
Oh no...
Two lines! Two fucking lines! 'My wife returns from Europe tomorrow. I can't see you any more.' Just like that!
I don't think I'd be much good in a war...
I don't know. Not a war exactly. It's more a... a misapprehension maybe...
Where to?
Yeah.
How's it sound?
You think I got it?
Well, who have we here...?
Where are you going?
You're not going anywhere!
Do you expect me, for one moment, to believe you have greater insight into my personality than I do?
You may discuss my predicament, Doctor. You may discuss it with anyone you like, but not with me. I'm not interested. I can solve my problems without recourse to a veternarian.
Besides, I don't want to be what you want to make me.
Normal. Average.
...Did you really say that?
This whole thing is a joke!
No, you stay calm, Doctor! But you're finding that difficult, aren't you?  Why, are you attracted to me? Perhaps later, in some of our more intimate sessions... after we know each other a little better...  and you've torn my personality to shreds, and I'm weeping and vulnerable...  then you'll really get your kicks, won't you, "Doctor?"
You were with him at the end.
In which part of me did this knowledge reside? In these hands? In this mind? In this heart?  And reading and speaking. Not things learned... so much as things remembered.
Stolen memories. Stolen and hazy. They taunt me in my dreams. I've seen a beautiful woman lying back and beckoning for me to love her. Whose woman was this? I've seen boys playing, splashing about in a stream. Whose childhood friends were these?  Who am I?
Elizabeth, really! He's quite mad!
How could all my father's knowledge and skill fail to save her?
Our decision. Together.
I give you my soul...
Victor. I love you,
Captain, I implore you. The men are frightened and angry. They want your assurance.
The entire school heard it. It wasn't something one could miss.
What now? Writing about it in your journal won't help.
It's the down-and-outs I pity most. Those who can't fend for themselves. They'll be dead by the thousands before this is done. They don't stand a chance out there.
Professor Waldman.
Krempe has a way of provoking my temper.
To say the least. I came here to expand my mind, but honest inquiry seems strangled at every turn. All we do is cling to the old knowledge instead of seeking the new.
We are kindred, you and I. Men of ambition. Let me tell you all that I have lost in such pursuits. I pray my story will come to mean for you all that is capricious and evil in man.
Good night, Alice.
Steve said you were thinking of leaving. True?
Trouble?
Why don't we run? Just run now?
What the hell?
Did anyone ever tell you you're beautiful when you're angry?
It's gonna be a long summer.
Mmmmmmmph?
Best over...
Like waves. It's never been likes waves before.
Yeah. I got it on before this --  -- all started.
You like the car?
It's hardly been used at all. I got it from a drug dealer who only drove it 5 times in as many years. Swear to God. That's like new.
Yeah, follow us.
What's your name?
Swear to God, on the Bible, you won't try to escape and you'll get us across the border.
Okay, does anybody here know what's going on?
There's nothing wrong with this place.
It's not a flop house. It's basic and simple. That doesn't make it a flop house.
What?
Do what?
What did I say?
Should I use the last bullets on us?
Were you giving that pig signals?
What did I tell you? What did I tell you? Buy the road map and leave.
Yeah, explain it to me. I need an explanation. What's the matter with you?
No.  That woman wouldn't of said shit if she had a mouthful.
Is it me? Is it my fault?
That's what you think?
I'm lookin' scared?
You know what you look like?
I don't know if there's any single reason.  But my father was Navy. And he had this old-time recruiting poster in his den.  It showed a girl trying on a sailor's uniform while saying, "Gee, I wish I were a man! I'd join the Navy!"  Was maybe 10 years old when I first saw it, and even then it felt wrong.  Made me mad.  And I don't think a month has gone by that I haven't thought about that poster.  "Gee, I wish I were a man."
The woman I saw you with...
But are there... I mean, how many...
Pardon the hour, sir.  But you told me to come to you immediately if I felt I was being mistreated in any way.
Sir.  If tomorrow... I was not under your command... would the inquiry still go forward?
Think I overplayed it?
You know him.
It should.  You nominated him for Spec-Recon just three days after you nominated me.
Did you set me up?  Did you set me up just to see me fail?
Close as I can get, el-tee!
Automatic five-second deduction, which slips you under the wire. It's called "gender-norming," O'Neil -- standard procedure for all females in physical training courses.  Where you been the last few years?
Jordan...
So here we are again.  Staring three years of operational duty in the face.
Which is guy-speak for...
What're you guys doing?  Huh?
England went out with a stress fracture.  That puts you in charge, lieutenant.
Well, who the shit you think you are?  Comin' in here like that?
You mind?  I'm trying to eat here.
Animal, you don't think that's true, do you?
What are you doing?
You're a reporter. That's what you always wanted to be, right? I'm happy for you. Really, I am.
Come on, the broadcast booth is right over here.
Four years. Girl, I'm surprised he didn't ask you to marry him.
Three years digging up worms in Chernobyl? How did Mrs. Tatopoulos handle it?
Really? A girlfriend then?
Who are they? Lieutenant, get those people away from there.
The radiation is not an anomaly, it's the clue. This creature is far too unique on every level to be some lost dinosaur.
Do I know you?
Contact the military and get them to send a bomber to blow up this building before these things escape.
Sir! The pressure.  It's normalizing.
We've got to stop!
You don't hold a thruster down! It's for quick boosts
~hex!  Alex, are you oKav?
And note the sucked in gut.
"Go into the cloud! ...
Commander, as I was saying... In "The Quasar Dilemma", you used the auxiliary of deck b for Gamma override. But online blueprints indicate deck b is independent of the guidance matrix, so we were wondering where the error lies?
Yes but, we were wondering-
Go. They're off again.
What?  Up?
Systems register functional.
...The digital conveyor.
How the hell is Fred supposed to project a hologram?
More to the left... Stay parallel...
Let me try.  Computer?  Computer?...
But I'm the Commander!
Do we have a replacement Beryllium sphere onboard?
Jason?...  I don't think the pig lizard was Gorignak...
That's it, It's go time.
Right.  Well... Listen, I'm  I'm sorry about that whole... thing.. before. It was kind of a misunderstanding.  I'm sure we can work this out like reasonable people... How's the uh...  ... that going to heal up? God, I hope so, I feel just awful about that.
Listen, I'd like to, but frankly.. I'm not even sure where it is, or even...
Commander?... Where are you... going?
You... You mean Earth?
"Deception..." "Lies."
Faster Tommy. Get us out of here!
Pedal to the metal Tommy...
Unfortunately, I'll never get the chance.  I'm leaving in an hour for Congress to scream like a violated virgin about my promotion.  Wasting my time, naturally... Look at her teasing those bumpkins.
The army needs you.
Then, I need you.  We all do. Without your victory the men would have no hope at all.
I hope I never have to believe that.
Colonel, sir, Mrs. Washington inquires if you are going to join her for dinner?
I am to take command of Major General Lafayette's division and lead the attack.
I was a clerk's apprentice on Saint Croix.  But, then I went to King's College.
What's your advice, Alexander?
George, I'm sorry.  We all know the army will acquit Arnold...
They are... friends of Congress.
Any word from Canada?
However, through my relations with members of his majesty's court, I am a representative of the French government whose deepest desire is to be one people, united with our American brothers in arms to defeat the rapacious armies of King George of England.  Vive la France!  Vive l'Amerique!
I feel the same, sir.
Well, we must keep in mind the Dower Laws.  One third of everything we have is mine and since our Negroes have been interbreeding, it would be legally impossible to distinguish them.
Leave me, now sir, I am tired.
Sir, if you don't mind my saying, I don't understand your history at all.  I mean, why would you want to win the war?  You're not after glory, like Benedict...  You're a slave owner, and yet you invite blacks to fight in your army.
No.  We're all of us after something.  It's easy for me to fight for the common man.  My father could only dream that I would be... a general someday?  And what of my daughter or son?  I know what I'm after.  But now, with all this talk about compromise?  It means the rich will just be more wealthy and the common man has no hope.
So, you are William's wild young neighbor?  Or should I say, 'brother'; William claims you as a member of his family.  I have heard so many unflattering tales about you, and I understand, that except for you, this 'family' is quite cultivated.
Oh, but you must not mind my talking about you!  In fact, William says my main job here at Belvoir is to civilize you; to make an honest English gentleman out of you.
And to think I am teaching you to become one of them...
My daughter, I ask only...
He's gonna plea-deal his way out. Give up this ace stunt man now one of the West Coast dope kings, if they go easy on the Cat.
What, did you see it work in some movie you got beat up in?
What, the setup didn't work so you want the key back?
You understand I knew Harry was lying, saying this wasn't any good, but holding on to it, man, like you have to break his fingers to get it from him.
How 'bout I give you to three, then I organize your fuckin' brains all over the wall back there. One...
In just a second. Two...
Last night. When he called me over to your office to talk about it.
Ray Barboni?
Are you the guy they called Ray Bones?
Who is this? I'm the one telling you the way it is, okay, asshole? That's who I am. Now you want your three hundred grand or don't you?
The man you're steppin' on belongs to me and my partner.
Get in line, bro.
Tough shit, bro. This ain't Miami. You want something, talk to me.
I'm looking at you.
That's what I'm doing.
Dick Allen's a very dear friend of mine. How far you want to go with this?
So he comes to L.A...
She looks familiar.
Is he giving you a check or cash?
You owe me the dry cleaner's fifteen grand plus the juice which is what another, uhh...
At that point, basically, that has to be it.
We call you a taxi.
Mr. Barboni is a good customer.  Works for Jimmy Capp.
I got you a copy of the script.
Yeah?
Karen! What the fuck are you doing?!
I hate to say I told you, but I did. I told you don't start nothing with him that time.
No, you just broke his fuckin' nose instead.
All I know is he came by the barber shop, all fuckin' undone, wanting to know where you were staying in Vegas. I told him I don't know. I still don't.
He already knew it.
Whatta you doing out there?
What're you talking about? You wanna be a movie star?
How you gonna do that? You don't know shit about making movies.
So this means you've reconsidered our deal on Mr. Lovejoy?
Yeah, what'd he have to say?
Harry -
A passenger liner, north island. Over.
Passenger vessel "Chimera." I will spell: charlie hotel india mary echo romeo alpha. No registry information is available at this time. I have determined to the best of my ability that the vessel has been abandoned on the high seas at position one seven four west, five seven north at...  Two zero one four hours zulu time. Over.
Are you crazy? Do you realize we got ourselves a ship? We own a ship, Dodge.
The turbine blew.
Ready?
One guy isn't gonna be so stupid.
What the hell would a freighter be doing up here? It's way out of the lanes. There's not a port for 800 miles.
Didn't happen yesterday, I'll tell you that. Torn parts rusted bad as the rest of the boat.
What if that fucker finds it before we're ready to go?
There's no way we're gonna hide a few thousand pounds of gold from the Coastguard here. Besides, it'll be safer where it is.
You're late.
Don't fall asleep.
Coffee.
What'd you find up there?
She was sailing up north, right?
Murphy to Epps.
You just shoot at something?
It's a good bet they'll be asking a lot of questions when they get here too.
Nope.
Not bad for dragging a leaky tub half way to Russia.
I must be in the wrong business.
Some classy tub in it's day, huh?
I don't know.
We're not gonna be able to pump it!
As I said, what seems to be the trouble?
It's nothing -- it's just some hormonal thing... don't worry about it...
What?
I-I honestly never intended for this to happen...
Enid and I were just friends. You know... we feel comfortable around each other... she really likes my old records and...
Well hello there, young employee of the Sidewinder.
What can you tell me, young man, about the various flavors of "frozen yogurt"?
Hi... what's up?
Since when is she an "actress"?
Who can forget this great hit from the 50's?
Look, that's back when I hated you.
There's my dad with Joanie.
What's going on now? What's he doing?
That was truly pathetic.
I'll bet he never jerks off...
That guy is totally amazing.
I think one of us should fuck Josh...
No, really...
I am not -- I just think it'd be funny to see what he'd do...
Yeah, but maybe one of us should at least try...
Hi.
You're lucky then, you can't see the veins on that guy's biceps.
A what?
How much is this?
You never paid me for that tape with the Indian dance routine.
Tsk! You Jews are so clever with money...
Oops! I dropped it!
Look at this -- "Lollipop Lolitas" - isn't child pornography totally illegal?
Actually, I was a whole lot more interested in the Cook's phenomenon when I was about your age. I've kind of lost interest since I've been working for them...
For nineteen years...
Nothing so glamorous... actually, I'm an assistant manager at their corporate headquarters.
Hey, I get good benefits, a good early retirement plan, nobody ever bothers me...
Where have you been? I've been looking all over for you... I've been wandering the streets day and night trying to find you...
No, actually Joe told me you were here... so how come you never call me anymore?
Yeah, I'll bet! So, how's it going with what's-her-name? Dana?
So, what kind of stuff do you guys do together? Is she into old records and stuff?
You know what my number one fantasy used to be?
I used to think about one day not telling anybody and just taking off and going to some random place... Do you ever think about stuff like that?
It would have to be some totally average day when nobody was expecting it, and I'd just disappear and they'd never see me again.
You know what we should do? Let's go get in your car right now and just take off! We could just drive away and find some new place and start a whole new life... fuck everybody!
I'll drive, then -- we'll go out in a blaze of glory!
Who cares? Let's just go... what's stopping us?
I'm serious! I'm just so sick of everybody! Why can't I just do whatever I want?
What do you want?
Did you remember to pay the phone bill?
He sees this chaos, he'll replace you all.
Lovely sound- they seem happy.
This sham? Ridiculous. Who needs it? It's only being built to control the ivory trade, make men richer.
Very good indeed.
All right- you'll spend your nights inside.  You'll have plenty of ammunition. You're totally protected, you have really nothing to fear.
You said "of course" you'd need the donkey. Why "of course"?
What a good week.
In my town, when I was little, there was a brute, a bully who terrorized the place.  But he was not the problem. He had a brother who was worse than he. But the brother was not the problem.  One or the other of them was usually in jail. The problem came when they were both free togther. The two became different from either alone.  Alone they were only brutes. Together they became lethal, together they killed.
I am also liaison between these two.
Where is it?
We'll be very sorry to lose you.  Perhaps I could take you to lunch today?
This is my address and telephone number. Will you call me?
Egon, I'd rather you didn't mention any of this to Peter if you don't mind.
I wish I could stay.  I feel personally responsible for you being here.
Please don't say that.  You won't go to prison.
You mean you cough up hairballs all over the rug?
Good luck.
Are you all squeaky clean now?
I think we hit the honeypot, boys.  There's something brewing under the street.
Oh migod!  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to do that.  It was an accident.
I was trying to get that smelly green thing. The guys asked me to help out.  I'm like the fifth Ghostbuster.
We don't go around altering valuable paintings, Dr. Venkman.
You've got to do something!
They're the Scoleri Brothers.  I tried them for murder.  They were electrocuted up at Ossining in '48.  Now they want to kill me.
Hi, welcome back to the 'World of the Psychic,' I'm Peter Venkman and I'm chatting with my guest, author, lecturer and of course, psychic, Milton Anglund.  Milt, your new book is called The End of the World.  Isn't that kind of like writing about gum disease.  Yes, it could happen, but do you think anybody wants to read a book about it?
Okay, so can you tell us when it's going to happen or do we have to buy the book?
This year?  That's cutting it a little close, isn't it?  I mean, just from a sales point of view, the book just came out, right?  So you're not even looking at the paperback release for maybe a year.  And it's going to be at least another year after that if the thing has movie-of-the-week or mini-series potential. You would have been better off predicting 1992 or even '94 just to be safe.
That's it?  "I'll be back?"
Hey, I didn't imagine it.  There must have been ten thousand gallons of it down there.
Is the line sinking?
I'm Ray --
Don't tell me, let me guess.  All-you-can-eat barbecue rib night at the Sizzler?
I think she looks pretty good here, don't you?
Are you telling me how to drive?
Kind of makes you wonder, doesn't it?
Okay.  Just give me a second here.  I have to leave now but if you've got some time I'd like you to come back this evening and do some more work with me.
No, just that one word -- Zuul -- but I have no idea what it means.
He is a very close friend.  Do you have some explanation of what happened in my apartment?
Can't you tell me now?
You must have gotten the last copy.
Hittites,  the Mesopotamians and the Sumerians.  "Zuul was the Minion of Gozer."
What's he doing in my refrigerator.
I don't think so.  I'm busy Thursday night.
All right.  Since you put it that way.
Hello, I'm Roger Delacorte - the Head Librarian.  Are you the men from the University?
Thank you for coming.  I'd appreciate it if we could take care of this quickly and quietly.
Can I help you?
Great!  How's it going?
Hey!  I'm getting a little tired of this.
Yeah, but I didn't know you were going to give me electric shocks.  What are you trying to prove?
I'll tell you the effect!  It pisses me off!
Wait!  Wait!  There's something I forgot to tell you.
Don't cross the beams.
Trust me.  It will be bad.
I just realized something.  We've never had a completely successful test with any of the equipment.
Spengler and I have charted every psychic occurrence in the Tri-State area for the past two years.  The graph we came up with definitely points to something big.
What do you mean by "seen?"
Well, I was at an unexplained multiple high-altitude rockfall once.
Everybody can relax.  I found the car.  How do you like it?
I guess they don't build them like they used to, huh?
Who was the architect?
What's he talking about?  Choose what?
It's disgusting!  Animals!  I had to come here under armed guard.  Slaves -- get this junk out of my sight.
Welcome back from your great triumph Narcissus Meridas.  My father sends his heart felt praise.  Sadly, Marcus is in dark humors -- nothing to worry about, but he needs rest. Likely just the weather.
The army is a problem.  They love you.  You have led them from victory to victory in the name of Rome and they love you.  And after all, you're just a hothead acting from a misguided sense of loyalty -- who could fault you for that?  Thus have I reached a compromise with the Senate over your fate: instead of executing you, I'm sending you to Rome where you will be tried...
Marcus Aurelius has died.
"Caesar Commodus discovering his lineage converges with the Demigod, Hercules, has determined to display his magnificence before his beloved citizens."  The Emperor's going to fight in the arena.  I'm supposed to write this for tomorrow's edition.
Who are you?  Narcissus The Good?  I have heard of Narcissus Meridas. That's who I hear you are.
How did you get condemned to the arena without a trial?
Would you support the Senate if they would give you a trial?  You'd have to give me your word.
You're a citizen and a soldier.  Not a gladiator.
"If you consider yourself to be only one thread of many in the tunic, then it is fitting for you to be like the rest of men, just as the thread has no desire to be any better than the other threads. But..."
Serious stuff...
This is our oil from our estates?
Sorry but I have to get at least one fight out of you otherwise I won't even get back the cost of the bribe I had to pay the arena slaves to get you here.  I know what you're trying to do:  kill yourself and trust in the Roman tradition of justice that the emperor will let your family survive and keep their lands.  The only thing you have accomplishes is to prove you're a very important individual.  You make me feel good about my investment!  And that puking pig Jerses -- he won't even discuss you.  Both of you have clamped mouths!  But I love all my fighters -- I'll find out about your family.  And about you.  That I promise.
Tell me honestly, since this may be our last earthly meeting:  if this were a fair fight where would you put your money?
Such nobility from such an ignoble mouth.  Take my advice and make that bet.
Benjamin -- do you dislike me for some reason?
Benjamin --
Benjamin -- do they know you?
No -- don't cry --
Don't cry. 
She said she was having a drink in the hotel with a friend. You waited for her in the parking lot and told her she was too drunk to drive home and that you would get her a room for the night.
Then you took her upstairs and you raped her.
You won't?
But you might.
Is that so? You might marry me?
When?
How about tomorrow? I don't mean to be pushy but --
Benjamin?
Oh -- hello, Mr. McCleery.
It's all right, Mr. McCleery.
Hello.
Benjamin?
Where are you?
Where are you?
Did you get a room?
Give me an hour.
Benjamin, I want to ask you something.
Will you take me home?
What do you think of me?
You've known me nearly all of your life. You must have formed some opinion.
Did you know I was an alcoholic?
Did you know that?
Sit down, Benjamin.
No.
Don't be nervous.
I want to say something first.
Benjamin -- I want you to know I'm available to you. If you won't sleep with me this time --
If you won't sleep with me this time, Benjamin, I want you to know you can call me up any time you want and we'll make some kind of arrangement.
Do you understand what I said?
I got a single room.
But there's one thing. The desk clerk seemed to be a little bit suspicious. I mean -- I don't know what their policy is -- but --
Yes -- I think that would be good.
Well -- goodbye then --
Yes?
To tell you?
Well -- I want you to know how much I appreciate this -- really --
What?
Oh? You're absolutely right. Absolutely. It's 512.
Do you want to hear it or not?
I got up. I ate breakfast and went shopping. During the afternoon I read a novel.
What?
I wish you'd tell me.
Drive down the block.
Say hello to Mrs. Robinson, Benjamin.
They don't know?
Well -- when did you decide all this?
Here. It looks like you need a refill.
What?
Is anything wrong? You look a little shaken up.
Can you see me now?
I'm having luck for the first time in my life.
Like dancing?
Please do not be frightened, Madam.
Nothing -- only to be here.
But surely you must know -- because I love you.
You may keep the pearls -- I don't want them any more -- I'll make you a present of them.
I'll not denounce you.
So --
But now, you must go... I give you the pearls. But now you must go ---
And now?
What's the matter, Mr. Kringelein?
Then you know him?
That was my last.
I've no luck.
Oh, let the poor devil alone.
The night clerk has already gone -- you are late.
And the child isn't coming?
News? Yes -- killing in number one- sixty-four.
The big manufacturer killed Baron von Gaigern.
I don't know.
It seems that he was a thief and an imposter.
Well, Mr. Kringelein, are you getting what you're looking for?
A masculine paradise -- drink, the ladies, dancing...
You must learn as quickly as your time allows -- Believe me Mr. Kringelein, a man who isn't with a woman is a dead man.
I'm always alone -- I have been everything.
Good evening, Mr. Kringelein -- Where's the Baron?
Mr. Kringelein -- How you have changed, you look so nice.
No - absinthe.
What...! --
Don't misunderstand me. I'm a married man -- with grownup daughters. Uh --
Come here. 
Tentative my foot -- a month before this your old father-in-law came very privately and scratched at my door.
Mr. Preysing has too scrupulous a regard for certainties...
Oh, come, Madam -- please come. 
Come along, oh, Madam, come along. The train will be going.
Mr. Kringelein will be a good friend and not accept your invitation to dance.
What's the use of asking, Gru -- he is at the train -- He will be there.
How'd you figure you were gonna get away with that?
You're fuckin right you're not. How much did your pals cut you in for on that nag, huh? Or did they give you the same kind of screwing you gave me?
Your kid's in the back here. He's crying.
The kids beat him up, because his home life is, uh, different.
Want a look?
Yes, yes, but that's --
Sounds like a good Idea.
I like those.
You're one to talk. Still running playback money for the mob.
What's that?
Roy, I don't want money from you.
I need this, Roy. I can't run without money, and if I can't run I'm dead.
Just a few bucks.
Her credit cards. How far am I gonna get with that?
At what?
A job? I've never had a legit job in my life!
Roy, I know what to do with myself! It's a big world out there.
What?
Roy, that's fine, but I don't have time for this. Bobo --
Bobo isn't after you! Bobo's after me, and he's goddamn good! But so am I. I'm a survivor, Roy. I survive.
And to survive, my way, I need money. Bobo knows about the stash in the car, so I didn't dare touch it, not if Lilly Dillon's dead. So that leaves this.
There's nothing more to talk about.
That isn't granite. If that fell on me, it wouldn't hurt at all.
Big spender.
Yeah?
What?  What for?
I realize this is a shock.
That's natural.
I'm sorry, it was her all right. Her gun, even.
I grant you, it's a little odd, shoot yourself with a gun with a silencer on it, but it was hers, all right. It really is your mother, Mister Dillon.
Do you have any particular reason to say that?
Where, judging by the looks of the finger and palm prints, she struggles to open the window before banging on it like hell.
I'll be damned.
Nothing's changed since yesterday, or last week, or last month... the answer's still "no."
Now you're joking, right?
You really think Eddie killed her?
Who?
The serial killer?
What's this?
Whatever happened to women in back?
Mom, I want to go to the fair ...
What should I do?
God ... this can't be true.
Runes were a kind of early alphabet that originated in Northern Europe thousands of years ago.  They were symbols -- carved out of stone or pieces of wood.  Of all the runes, Thorn had the most negative influence. Cults used them in blood rituals to portend future events and invoke magic.
Halloween.
But with Rogers and his house of hacks gone, you'd make the rules.  Just think it over.
You've created a monster.
Home.
Excuse me.
Huh.
He's a kind of gladiator who fights with a knife and a net and doesn't wear anything but a jockstrap.
You told me.
When we were up in the tree so long--with the bats.
Fourteen times you told me.  I counted.
You'd get this funny look in your eyes, and I'd say to myself, "Oh, Jesus--he's going to tell me what a retiarius is again."
Insurance!
Yes, wife, it is.  Come here, boy.  Your father is home.
What's this?
That's a rifle you have?
Of course it is.  Is it loaded?
What's that all about?
Your old beau?
I don't want that chancre mechanic in here.
We all are.
When I'm dead--  or fucking.
I'm going to touch your shoulders very gently now.  You mustn't scream.  So tense, so tense.
You're thinking with your brain instead of your body.  That's why you're so tense!  Forget Norbert. Relax.  It's body time.
Well--what have we here?  A family.
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.
Money?  There's plenty of that. Mildred got the brewery.  You'll probably get the baseball team.
Help your mother find the bullet.
I mean--I can't leave you here. You'll have to go.  I'll tell Mrs. Ryan you were here.  You can come back later.
She's fine.  Please--
Will you please go?  An emergency!
Wasn't that sweet of me?
We have, have we?
Hands and knees, you say?
And you, Colonel?  Let me guess: You don't know.
Don't touch me.
No.
Really?
Yeah.
Coming.
Herb Shuttle is taking me to a fight.
We made the date three months ago.
You fool, you fool.
Minors aren't allowed at fights.
There's a girl I want to ask you about.
No, I don't.
What do you think of this... ah, shade of blue, Mary.
Don't you think it's a little too... bright?
I thought you were going to bed?
I is for Irresistible Grace. God's grace cannot be resisted or denied. And P is for the Perseverance of the Saints. Once you are in Grace you cannot fall from the number of the elect. And that's the 'TULIP.'
He has to. That's Predestination. If God is omniscient, if He knows everything -- and He wouldn't be God if He didn't -- then He must have known, even before the creation of the world, the names of those who would be saved.
More or less.
Out of gratitude for being chosen. That's where Grace comes in. God first chooses you, then allows you, by Grace, to choose Him of your own free will.
Yeah.  Well, mostly.
I'll admit it's confusing from the outside. You've got to see it from the inside.
It's not quite the same thing.
Listen, Niki. My daughter's been missing five months. I've gone through a lot to find out what's happened to her. I just saw a girl killed. I will not let Tod slip out of my hands. You have to tell me where he is.
I'm only human, you know.
But this is my apartment.
How's your business, Jake?
You wait here. I'll find out where she is.
I've got fifty thousand dollars to invest.
Well, Bill -- mind if I call you Bill?  Let me be frank. I've made a lot of money. I've got my own business in Detroit. Rivets. I make rivets and sell them to Fisher Body.  Well, rivets, you know, can get pretty boring after a while. When my business manager told me I should shelter some money, I thought I'd try this.
I thought I'd invest in a film. I want to sort of become involved in the process of making a film, meet the people who make films, learn how it's done...
Not exactly...
It's an investment.
I thought you were a businessman.
Jake.
Sounds all right.
You can fuck off, too.
I ain't ever gonna see him again anyway.
Okay, lady. Out.
Eh, no. Thank you.
Eh, no.
I don't know.
How about some ginger pie?
I'll heat some up. My, it's nice to see you again, Harold. How's your hearse?
Boy, Maude. The way you handle cars. I'd never handle a car like that.
No.
Oh, yes! Every day. But I don't need a defense anymore. I embrace! Still fighting for the Big Issues but now in my small, individual way. Shall we have a song?
Yes. I understand. A lot of people enjoy being dead. But they are not dead really. They're just backing away from life.  They're players - but they sit on the bench. The game goes on before them. At any moment they can join in.  Reach out! Take a chance! Get hurt maybe. But play as well as you can.  Go team, go! Give me an "L." Give me an "I."  Give me a "V." Give me an "E." LIVE!!!!!  Otherwise you'll have nothing to talk about in the locker room.
Don't you advance on me.
Supper for two.
It's all right. It's organic.
I'm going to marry the woman I love.
I see. Junkyards. What is the fascination there?
Is it the machines? The noise? The people?
Boy, to think I could maybe make my own.
Well, well. All my family together again. How very sweet.
Frank.
You knew?
So... You're Kirsty, huh?
Get out of the way.
I don't know, Kyle. You're the fucking expert. Now get out of the way!
Where am I?
Steve...
How am I ever gonna get a girl?? I drive around in a garbage truck
harbinger of pestilence, seed of destruction --
Do you believe in hell?
Grigory -- That's Russian, right?  Thought they were on our side...
C'mon -- Rasputin??
They took his name from this little inscription that was stuck on his tank.
C'mon, champ. You look a little woozy, there.
But not everyone was so lucky.  Two agents died today. Clay probably won't survive the night. You're reckless.
Helping you -- I just --
Hey, your chili's getting cold --
But I understand what you don't like about me. I do. What I am makes you feel out of place -- out there --
Listen. I'm not like Myers. He makes you feel like you belong. And -- that's good. It really is. I -- wish I could do something about this --  But I can't.  I can promise you only two things... One: I'll always look this good. Two: I won't give up on you. Ever.
Wait! Wait! Watch the fucking paint work.
Just take it slowly.
The box... you opened it. We came.
It's a means to summon us -- it's called the Lament Configuration.
Cenobites. Explorers in the further regions of experience. Demons to some. Angels to others.
Please. Get back into bed.
That's easily arranged. But first, back into bed.
You bastard --
Bastard.
Frank --
You can't let me stay like this. Please. You can't.
She'll tell them everything...
That's probably her now. Or the police.
Don't you care?
Maybe we should just leave --
Well we can't just stay here --
Why didn't he want to sell it?
What have you done?
Who was it?
What are you drinking?
Plain soda?
I try not to drink at lunch-time. Makes me sleepy in the afternoon. You like to keep a clear head, eh?  One soda, one whisky.  I do it anyway. No will-power. Got a busy afternoon?
You know, you're very beautiful.
Well I want you to see the house.
I have to talk to you.
You know I do know the way home.
Not that late.
All right.  No. That's nice.
What do we do if there isn't?
I'll come back later, huh?
Barry, I'm fucking broke!  I know we used to fuck with anyone who asked for anything we didn't like, but it's gotta stop.
What did he ever do to you?
It wasn't even his terrible taste. It was his daughter's.
...But the word "yet..." Yeah, you know what, I'd get the impression that you wanted to see it.  Otherwise you'd say you didn't really want to.
It was Jan, and it was a long time after--
Fuck off, Barry.
Because it's in The Big Chill.
Liar.  We saw it in the Lawrence Kasdan double-bill with Body Heat.
Holy Shiite!  What the fuck's this?
"Somebody's Gonna Die" by Blitz. "Bella Lugosi's Dead," Bauhaus. It's got that creepy Halloween feeling.
It's all kind of lost in the... in the dense mists of time now... It wasn't that I really liked Marco more.  In fact I thought you were more, shall we say, attractive than him.  It was just that he knew he was good-looking and you didn't, and that made a difference somehow.  You used to act as if I was weird for wanting to spend time with you, and that got kind of beat, if you know what I mean.  Your self-image started to rub off on me and I ended up thinking that I was strange.  And I knew that you were kind and thoughtful... you made me laugh, and I dug the way you got consumed by things you loved... and Marco seemed a bit more, I don't know, glamorous? More sure of himself?  Less hard work, because I felt like I was dragging you around, sort of.  A little sunnier.  Sparkier.  I don't know.  You know what people are like at that age.  They make very superficial judgements.  Do you think that's superficial?  He was a clown, if it's any consolation.
Rob --!
What needs sorting out?
Funnily enough I haven't been too thrilled about it.
Yeah, well, I've stopped all that now.
Yeah.
I dunno.
But Laura... that's me.  That's all there is to me.  There isn't anything else.  If you've lost interest in that, you've lost interest in everything.
Hi.
I'll look for 'em.  How you doing?
Fine, I'm sure it's in the file at home.  I'll call you when I find it, and then we'll talk.
Don't forget your CDs.
Sure they are.
Okay, okay.  I get the picture.
I got it.  You like Sting but you don't like Gram Parsons, because you've never heard of him.
I guess I am.
When are you going back?
What?
I've only got a couple left.  I'm saving them for later.
... Like Mexico.  Or Jamaica.  Or New York, even.
I'll pay for you.  Even though you owe me money.  We have to do something with the money I earn.  I need to. I deserve it.  You can just think of it as winning the lottery.
Money does not matter.  I do not care how much you earn.  I'd just like you to be a little happier in your work, but beyond that you can do what you like.
How?  How were we the same people?
Because I'm not allowed to.  I still do, after work.  So, what?  Should we just break up?  Is that what you're saying?  Because if you are, I'm going to run out of patience.
But what?
You haven't changed so much as a pair of socks in the years I've known you.  If we've grown apart, then I'm the one who's done the growing, and all I've done is change jobs.
I can't go to work with my hair dyed pink.  And I can afford to go shopping more now, and I've met a couple people I like over the last year or so.
More confident, maybe.
Less neurotic.  Are you intending to stay the same for the rest of your life?
Yeah, you're alright.  But you're certainly not happy.  So what happens if you get happy?  And yes I know that's the title of an Elvis Costello album, I use the reference deliberately to catch your attention. Should we split up because I'm used to you being miserable?  What happens if you, I don't know, start you're own record label, and it's a success? Time for a new girlfriend?
I'm an idiot.  I should have played the record first.  This place is about to get burned down.
She just wanted to pick up some stuff. No big thing.  A relief, actually.
It's a great song.
Yeah?
I think you have more.
Doesn't have a head, does he?
Miss Cartwright, what is it I can do for you?
It's not mine.
He sees me as a threat.
Here, try this.  I suppose they're still making women the same as back then.
What is it like?  Being you?
But you're known so much. History I'll only read about.
What is it you want?
Forgers do it all the time.  They take the birth certificate of some- one who died young and use it to get legit I.D.  Usually they carry it long enough to pass some bad checks then dump it.
Someone should check him out. Maybe a collection somewhere got knocked over.  He has one, he might have two.
He told me there could be only one.
I don't understand.
I'm twenty-two.
It will take less effort as you learn.
Oh please.  Another one.
Something pretty.
Your name?
Fish are creatures of habit.  They like their food where they're used to it.  At the top, hiding in old leaves.
My father taught me.
And have you something to settle with me?
Friend of yours?
What were _you_ looking for?
This is Murphy. More slop on the hanging.
Ready? The Sheriff's just put two hundred more relatives on the payroll to protect the city against the Red Army -- which is leaving Moscow in a couple of minutes.  Up a dime.
I'll keep you in mind.
Hildy Johnson... Oh, hello, Bruce. Have you got it? Is it certified?
Here it is, Bruce. One -- two -- three -- four hundred -- and fifty dollars.
Well, I'll try to give her one.
Just for the first year.
Well, Bruce, here you are -- certified and everything.
Oh, Bruce, let me see that money Hildy gave you.
There's a lot of counterfeit big bills going around.
You're going to be in office for exactly two days more and then we're pulling your nose out of the feed bag.
Sweeney! You can't do that to me! Not today, of all days! Jumping Jehosophat! Oh, no, Sweeney... Well, I suppose so... All right. If you have to, you have to.  How do you like that? Everything happens to me -- with 365 days in the year -- this has to be the day.
Sweeney.
Not yet. Might just as well be. The only man on the paper who can write -- and his wife picks this morning to have a baby!
I don't care whether he did or not. He's supposed to be covering the Earl Williams case and there he is -- waiting at the hospital! Is there no sense of honor left in this country?
There's nobody else on the paper who can write! This'll break me, unless --  Hildy!
You've got to help me, Hildy.
It'll bring us together again, Hildy -- just the way we used to be.
Don't mock, Hildy, this is bigger than anything that's happened to us. Don't do it for me! Do it for the paper.
If you won't do it for love, how about money? Forget the other offer and I'll raise you twenty-five bucks a week.
All right -- thirty-five, and not a cent more!
Great grief! What's that other paper going to give you?
Oh! In that case, the raise is off and you go back to your old salary and like it. Trying to blackjack --
If he's nuts, why doesn't the State just put him away?
The colored vote happens to be very important to the Mayor of this town.
Hildy!
Get the lead out of your typewriter and start pounding out a load, will you? Snap into it!
All the words you've got.
Where's Mrs. Baldwin?
What happened?
No, you don't! Walter!
What!
Butter-fingers! I give you an old lady to take somewhere, and you hand her over to the cops!
Now everything's fine. She's probably squawking her head off in some police station.
There's money in it, Cooley.
Say, that's old Prissy Bensinger's desk.
That must be the tenth alienist they've had on Williams. Even if he wasn't crazy before, he would be after ten of those babies got through psychoanalyzing him.  Gimme the desk.
Yeah? What did he ever do for his country?
Come on, you! Before we slap you down.
No -- just coffee, Gus.
Where'd you get this?
Just one second --
Hold your horses -- will you, Olsen? Hurry up, Fred!
Fine, thanks, Sheriff.
I won't.
Gentlemen of the Press! Always picking on somebody who can't defend himself -- the littler the better.
Who is it?
Did you get that, Hildy?
Mother!
Mother, I can explain everything. I'll go with you in five minutes and --
Earl, there's just one thing I ought to clear up for the interview.
I don't blame you, Earl.  If I were in your place I wouldn't trust anybody, either.
They'll get him! They'll get him!
Why not?
But you could bring 'em in here! We'll pay all your expenses.
For heaven's sake, why not?
No, they wouldn't -- they'd gain one! And I guarantee that they'll graduate with highest honors!
Get the cops, somebody.
Never let a rat creep up on you.
I never was.
Bruce, look! Dad got some German jam.
But Dad, It's the News.
...It was a toss-up. His company went to India, mine went to France. Flip of a coin.
So you're going to be a grandfather.
When do you think you'll get leave again?
I want him. I want him so much. I'll kill myself if I can't have him.
It was the best time of his life.
Bless you, Mac. What would I have done without you?
I wish it could all have been different.
You're having me on, Molly.
You've been drinking. Your tipsy.
I'll cut your fucking tits off and shove 'em down your throat.
Don't worry, I'll be right back.
Can I help you with something?
Wondering what?
What?
Do you believe this fucking girl?
Really? Huh, I thought for sure you'd say Lynette Fromme. She's got that snooty vibe I know you dig.
She's pretty cute.
There always one kid with no bodily controls. We had this dude, Jeff Baxter, he was a puker. The fucker would just sit there puke all over himself.
If we're talking cute... like regular cute, I'd say Leslie Van Houton, but cute ain't hot.
As far a hot... goes I gotta go with... Ruth Ann Moorehouse.
Fuck yeah, she is. I'd join a cult to get some of that... and the best part is she didn't try to kill the President or nothing, so that baggage ain't hanging around.
I'll let it slide, she was only seventeen.
Yeah, I guess... hot chicks are always nuts.
OK, let's relax. I'll check it, maybe I'm wrong. Don't everybody freak out just yet.
Yeah, maybe R.J. could just tow us and our car to the nearest garage.
Why are we stopping?
What are you doing!
Drive through it!
How long is that gonna take?
Yeah, Jerry, she said some pretty fucked shit to us.
I swear I've aged five years since this trip started.
God, I hate falling asleep in the afternoon. Now I'll be up all night...  ...ugh, my back is killing me.
I don't hear anything.
I still don't.
And I'm gonna help put the razor blades in the candy apples.
Hold on, hold on! Everybody calm down! It's the tow truck guy.
Fuck you, you fucking freak!
Get in... now!
Jesus Christ.
You sure this guy's supposed to ride with us? Seems kind of weird.
Sounds like a bad idea to me, probally just get in the way.
I guess not.
Tell him, Harold.
Thank you so much for accompanying me.
I have had such a difficult time in my personal life and you seem to be such a nice man... but I'm talking too much again, no?
Isn't Puff doing spectacularly, honey?
Gabby, what is it?
Fine.
You were wonderful!
We're going back to nature, you and I. I'm going to retrain you. I'm going to make you free again if I have to kill you doing it.
I don't know, honey. I don't know. Maybe he just didn't want to get involved.
It's just that I have some peculiarities, and...
You do?
You'll catch cold. It's cold.  What do you suppose he is, a survivalist?
Feral? Don't touch him! He might be diseased! He might... My God, rabies!
I think we should go. Please. Before he wakes up and, I don't know, eats us, or whatever feral things do.
Actually, I just had an amusing thought.
Feral, huh? Totally uncontaminated?
It's perfect!
Forget mice! Actually forget guinea pigs, cats, monkeys, and chimps also. I'm on to stage five: The human subject.
Don't you see? He's my Tabula Rasa, my Eliza Dolittle. He's my ticket to the top of the Behaviorist food chain. He's going to make me famous.
Is he, Lila? Is he happy living filthy and naked alone in this tick infested wilderness? Never to know the love of a good woman, never to revel in the pitter-patter of little feet, never to read Moby Dick, or marvel at a Monet, or just sit back after a day of hard but rewarding work, smoke a pipe, and wonder about the nature of reality.
Are you seeing somebody else, Nathan? I just have to know.
It would just be helpful to know.
Because, you know, you seem so distant. And you work late every night. And we hardly ever have sex, and when we do, it's... I don't know. It feels different.
Do you like my new look?
I'm trying, you know.  I'm trying to be what you want. I want to be what you want, Nathan. All I want is to be what you want.
Really?
Because I'm really trying, you know. Rosie says maybe only another two years of the elctrolysis.
You were gone a long time.
So he's doing okay?
That's funny because, you know, I just went and picked him up at some flophouse on the lower eastside. He called here when he ran out of his "mad" money after spending an entire evening drinking, watching strippers, and fucking a whore!  Oh, and what did you do tonight, honey?
And what did you do tonight, honey?
And what did you do tonight, honey?
Do you know what I gave up to be with you?
I gave up my soul, my beliefs. I gave up my body hair!
How the hell would you know anything about the human heart?
Free to come and go as you please. There's some "mad money" in the night table drawer.
I trust that you'll make good, mature decisions. I trust that you'll do the proper thing.
Good. Remember, when in doubt: Don't ever do what you really want to do.
Mother?
I'm ready.
Put it on the bed. That's the way it's done, isn't it?
And the way you're looking at me, is that the way you look at a man you've just beaten? As if you'd just taken his money, and now all you want is... his pride?
Stay with this kid. He's a loser.
James Findley is a very rich man. Grandfather left him twenty per cent of a tobacco company.
He's a gentleman. Gentleman gambler. He gets his kicks playing with hustlers. He's got an old Southern mansion with a pool table in the basement, drinks eight-year-old bourbon, smokes cork-tipped cigarettes.
Well, we won't.
So you figure you're still my manager, huh?
Well, you got a lot of games lined up for me?
Fifty per cent?
We really stuck the knife in her, didn't we, Bert?
Boy, we really gave it to her good.
Ten grand. I'm gonna win ten grand in one night.  ...Well, who's gonna beat me? C'mon, Charlie, who's gonna beat me?
You walked out on me like that. No goodbye, no nothing. Like a thief in the dark. We were partners. We were more than partners.  He was like a... like --
Yeah, yeah, like a son.  I've known this boy since he was sixteen. The first time I saw him, back in Oakland, I said, "This is a talented boy. This is a smart boy."
I want you to come back on the road with me.
What kind of life have you got here? Scufflin' around the small rooms, picking up eight, ten bucks a day?
Are you figuring on going back to Ames to play Minnesota Fats again? Is that what's on your mind?
This boy's crazy. They wiped the floor with him. They beat his brains out and he wants to go back.  What for? To take another beating?
Beautiful shot, Felson. Beautiful. You've played billiards before, Mr. Felson. Ah, you gentlemen sure you don't care for a drink?
You better not miss, friend.
You talk kind of funny, but I like it.
Yeah? What do you do now?
You don't look like a college girl.
No, I didn't mean that -- whatever that means. I mean, you just don't look young enough.
So why go to college?
What do you do on the other days?
Hey!
Eddie. The name is Eddie.
I don't know. Whatever you like it to be.
I could always get us a bottle.
Fifth of scotch?
Oh, cut my finger.
Sarah, do you think I'm a loser?
Yeah. I met this guy -- Gordon, Bert Gordon. He said I was. Born loser.
He knows. A lot.
I don't know. I'm not sure. He said there are people who want to lose, who are always looking for an excuse to lose.
He's a gambler.
Well, he owns things.
Well, what else does?
Yeah.  Yeah. It bothers me a lot.  'Cause, you see, twice, Sarah -- once at Ames with Minnesota Fats and then again at Arthur's...  ...in that cheap, crummy poolroom... Now, why'd I do it, Sarah? Why'd I do it? I coulda beat that guy, I coulda beat him cold. He never woulda known. But I just had to show 'em, I just had to show those creeps and those punks what the game is like when it's great, when it's really great. You know, like anything can be great -- anything can be great... I don't care, bricklaying can be great. If a guy knows. If he knows what he's doing and why, and if he can make it come off. I mean, when I'm goin' -- when I'm really goin' -- I feel like...  ...like a jockey must feel. He's sittin' on his horse, he's got all that speed and that power underneath him, he's comin' into the stretch, the pressure's on him -- and he knows -- just feels -- when to let it go, and how much. 'Cause he's got everything workin' for him -- timing, touch. It's a great feeling, boy, it's a real great feeling when you're right, and you know you're right. It's like all of a sudden I got oil in my arm. Pool cue's part of me. You know, it's a -- pool cue's got nerves in it. It's a piece of wood -- it's got nerves in it. You feel the roll of those balls. You don't have to look. You just know. Ya make shots that nobody's ever made before. And you play that game the way nobody's ever played it before.
If you don't mind I think I'll stay at the hotel.
Fats, I got about two hundred dollars here.
Fats, look, I got about two hundred dollars here. You can't run out on me.
Do you remember where you lived?
What about... now?
Yes.
Mine.
I don't know.
Yes.
Humans.
Need some gas?
Only got one kind.
There are more this year than last.
... And then everything blew up. And then I woke up.
It was so real, Dad.
What do you mean -- gone?  What the hell kind of a nurse are you, anyway?
They'll get us.
Well, come on, you two.  Time to go to bed.
Penicillin. At least it will help keep his fever down.
I wish I could do more but we're moving out.
Thirty seconds? Isn't that cutting it a little too close?
We're losing them.
Then what?
It's Air Force One for crying out loud. Still he gets sick?
What're you doing?
Organize every plane you can find and get some Goddamned pilots to fly them.
That's impossible...
You're late.
I shouldn't have left her.
We're leaving, don't try and stop us.
Mr. President, a real pleasure. They don't let us out much, you know.
Yes.
But if you want facts, Indy, I have none to give you. At my age, I'm prepared to take a few things on faith.
Marcus!
My name is Donovan. Walter Donovan.
Doctor Jones?
What's that?
This book contained a map -- a map with no names -- precise directions from the unknown city to the secret Canyon of the Crescent Moon.
Oh, it breaks the heart.
I'll never forgive myself --
I ought to tell you something.
The floor's on fire! See?!
And the chair.
When we're airborne, with Germany behind us, then I'll share that sentiment.
This is intolerable!
What did you find, Junior?
Why are you trying to kill us?
My father was looking for the Holy Grail. Did you kill him too?
Where is he? Talk -- or you're dead. Damn it, tell me! Tell me!
Then we'll die.
The Prime Minister doesn't seem that naive.
He's not exactly what we call "a spring chicken".
You know the villagers also claimed that this palace stole something from them.
Now what about the antidote, Lao.
Get to sleep Indy -- I stay up and keep eye on things...
Give me the stones!
For crying out loud, a kid's driving the car?!
What'd he say?
What do you mean -- how?
Dream -- nightmare is more like it.
Listen, Willie. Do exactly what I tell you now.
Can you move your arm?
Okay, I want you to lift your hand -- and pet the snake.
Yes, stroke it right along the maxillary and precaudal vertebrae.
I think you should sleep closer.  I meant for safety.
Primitive sexual practices?
GET US OUT! Willie, shut up and listen! There's got to be a fulcrum release! Look around!
Indy? Did you talk to them?
So now they believe me.
Give me your hat...
You're in my head...
Your name is Al...
You're not crazy. Don't...wait a minute, just let me explain.
Yeah JOE Why there's a little man in my head?
Why he's argumentative?
Now what?
Ever think of what they might have to do to find me?
Anything...A feeling...a smell..?
They'll know who I am.
Beautiful!
Touch her.
Mind your own business.
I feel like an idiot.
Ahhh...works...Ryuji... travel...just business...She's.. Fine Arts, University of Tokyo..
Beer. And cakes...cookies ..anything bad.
What are you doing?
What was it? What'd I say?
He aready made the deal..
Dieter!
I know it's no good.  I've no right to be jealous.
I've got twenty hours left. I could die in here. And you're falling in love.
Can you fly this?
If there is a POD inside him, We'll find it, and bring it out for study.
Me.
What are you doing here, where've you been?
That crazy guy?
Now, Joe, you know it was all a mistake, don't you?
Why would we want to hurt you?
Who?
How's that for fucking Savoir Fair!
Blake said that?
Promise you what?
I promise you that. I am not crazy. Course, if I was, I'd be the last to know. Why do you ask?
But I don't listen...then I'd be crazy.
If I was with you, I wouldn't
That was then. This is now. Who am I talking to?
And how'm I doing?
What's Gruner like?
Who was?
And Dieter.
And you?
What?
Don't blame yourself, I didn't have to come along.
He can't help us.
Do what? I don't know. I'm no good at this.
It wasn't me. It was him.
He told me what to do.
Joe Doakes? It's quarter to 10...
I have a seat. I've had it since nine.
Look, nobody knows we did it.
Just ran into two of your "geologists." Geologists whose hands aren't all chewed up...?
What was that about?
Sure.
Are you suggesting that she and Eric are influenced by money?
CBS does not do that. And, you're questioning our journalistic integrity?!
You're exaggerating!
You are a fanatic. An anarchist. You know that? If we can't have a whole show, then I want half a show rather than no show. But oh, no, not you. You won't be satisfied unless you're putting the company at risk!
You think I put that bullet in the mailbox myself...?
Well, as a "standard"... I'll hang with "is the guy telling the truth?"
Come again?
Uh, what are those boxes?
What do you need at the store?
Right now?
Why did you take your stuff from the office?
I don't understand.
Why? Who said?
Let me see this... No, 'cause I gotta know where you're going at all times.
...you filed a lawsuit against tobacco on behalf of the State of Mississippi, did you not?
Well, I'm working with someone, now, who was the former head of research at Brown & Williamson, a former corporate officer there.
So, is everything okay?
How many shows have we done? Huh? C'mon, how many?
Yeah, that's right.
I see a rhetorical question on the horizon.
Oh, how fortunate I am to have Lowell Bergman's moral tutelage to point me down the shining path. To show me the way.
Give me a break!
In the real world, when you get to where I am, there are other considerations...
Look, I really don't have that much time...
Talk to me outside the zone of your agreement?
Like where'd you work before Brown & Williamson?
You believe that?
You should. Because when you're done, a judgment is going to go down in the court of public opinion, my friend. And that's the power you have.
I believe that? Yes, I believe that.
Yes.
Are you talking to me or did somebody else just walk in here?! I never abandoned a source!
No, don't evade a choice you gotta make be questioning my reputation or "60 Minutes'" with this cheap skepticism!
I don't know how to say this, Jeff, except to just say it right out, so I'll say it. They do not want to air it.
B & W may have threatened litigation... CBS is on the block...  But you, I mean, I know how...
No? No, what?
I think I need to call the police. He won't respond...
Jeffrey, how are you? How's the family, okay?
What do you mean there is no family?
Jeff's a premiere golfer... What are you, a two handicap?
And, he gets out there and he has five strokes on us. He has more concentration than anybody I've ever met. It's spooky how he can concentrate.
Course I can't do much "wriggling" if you tie me up like that again. Massey -- this is one bad bad little girl.
I am here representing Mr. Dumbarton, on a... matter of some delicacy.
Excuse me?
Well -- I, uh, that is to say Mr. Dumbarton -- would like you to uh, neutralize a, uh, business associate by the name of Marylin Rexroth Doyle Massey uh Dumbart -- uh, Massey.
Objection, Your Honor. This isn't about Mrs. Rexroth's filial obligations.
Who was that?
Well. He said to "make the house mine."
"Who ever lov'd that lov'd not at first sight?"
Not really. You're not my client. Freedom of association. Big issue with the First Amendment fans. Want to go to Hawaii for the weekend?
No.
As a matter of fact, I'm a huge fan.
It has bones. Be sure to swallow one.
I have to say -- I'm speechless. No. I'm never speechless.
And I'm not used to -- Marylin -- there's something I want to ask you.
You don't like me?
Nonono. Marylin -- I'm your husband. I'd be entitled to Rex's money. No matter what happened to you.
I'm sorry. Where were we?
Please. I'm not seeing anyone until this is over. One husband at a time.
Is this Ming?
So, Miles. If you have a proposal, let's hear it.
My client has ruled that out.
That's delusional.
My client feels sufficiently dispassionate.
Ha Ha.
The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves. Well, let me ask you this: what kind of settlement do you seek? What are, for you, the parameters of the possible?
Nothing?
So, you propose that in spite of demonstrable infidelity on your part, your unoffending wife should be tossed out on her ear?
I tried to reach Ruth, but we couldn't get her.
I've been trying to nail George's for years, but he's very careful. I'll just keep having children. I think I'm pregnant, by the way.
Three is not Farrow.
I was surprised to get your note. My daughter hadn't told me anything about you. About your helping her.
Please understand me. When I say she didn't tell me anything about it, I mean not until a little while ago. She thinks you're entitled to anything you can get.
don't know. I'd have to see on what you base your claim. I presume you feel you're justified in
A time will come when you'll thank me for this.
Please don't shout.
It's my daughter! Go after her.
Never mind, son. She doesn't want it. 
That storm sure made a mess outa these roads.
Take my advicegrab the first bus back to Miami. That guy's a phony.
That's right. You didn't.
What for?
I never thought of that.
Do you mind joining the Israelites?
Detectives!
Peter
I wish you wouldn't talk too much. We let a car get away. 
Oh, they'll stop, all right. It's a matter of knowing how to hail them.
Expert! Going to write a book on it. Called the "Hitch-Hikers Hail."
You think it's simple, huh?
Any luck?
What about money?
That's swell!
I couldn't arrive in New York at three in the morning. Everybody's in bed.
There's a man here to see you, Sweetheart.
What's the matter?  Where's your husband, young lady
Yesif he is your husband.
No, he ain't! And the car's gone, too.
I'm hungry.
A thousand dollars!  Get out of this office before I throw you out bodily.
What's the thousand bucks for?
What!
Huh?
You're drunk.
If it's on the level.
Who's she gonna marry?
I wouldn't trust you as far as I could throw that desk.
I'd put you there myself.
Who's the guy she's gonna marry?
You!
Now I know you're drunk.  I'm going home. Don't annoy me any more.
See that. They're gone!
Gee! That musta been terrible.  I guess he had it coming to him though. But don't you worry about me. I don't talk. I never talk. Take my word for it. Gee, I wouldn't want anything to happen to my kids.
Oh, thanks, thanks, Mister. I always knew you guys were kind-hearted.
What was his voice like?
Did he pay?
And Oswald?
So you saw Oswald how many times?
Bill.
It's you I want to talk to, Bill.
Your boss got a serious problem, Bill.  Real serious.  We know what's been going on at your office
You've got nothin', Bill.  I'm talking as a friend now.  You're riding on the Titanic.  Time to jump off before you get destroyed along with Garrison.
...there were about nine or ten people, Cubans, friends of Dave doing some stuff in the bush with him. Place was a mess.  Dave's mind was a mess,  Y'know he had all those mice cages around cause he's working on this cure for cancer... Dave's smart - real smart - speaks five languages, knows philosophy, medicine, military history, politics.  He wanted to be a priest but they defrocked him 'cause he was queer...
Can you get some sworn statements?
Nick, what would happen if a man suffering from hypertension were to take an entire bottle of Proloid?
Can you ascertain if there's Proloid in his system?
Well, it doesn't make sense, Nick - he was afraid of dying, then he kills himself in a way that leaves no trace, but he leaves two unsigned suicide notes.
Leon's in a bad mood, don't get excited, he's all right.
I'm going to have to ask the jury to leave the courtroom.
Finally they shuttle him to a radio factory in Minks where he lives as high on the hog as he ever has - he's given 5,000 rubles, a roomy apartment with a balcony, has affairs with local girls.
I'm sorry.
You mean you identified him on Saturday, the day before Ruby shot Oswald?
But you didn't seem nearly so sure in your statement to the Warren Commission.
Did they live?
For sexual purposes?
Bill, Lou, we're standing in the heart of the United States Government's intelligence community in New Orleans.  That's the FBI there, the CIA, Secret Service, ONI.  Doesn't this seem to you a rather strange place for a Communist to spend his spare time?
Time?
The key is the second and third shots came right on top of each other, and it takes a minimum 2.3 seconds to recycle this thing.  The other problem is there was a tree right there...  Blocking the first two shots at the time they occur in the Zapruder film.
It was a Texas Live Oak, boss.  It sheds it's leaves the first week of March.  You try to hit a moving target at 88 yards through heavy foliage with this cheap 13-dollar sucker, the world's worst shoulder weapon.  No way.  The FBI tried two sets of tests and not one of their sharpshooters could match Oswald's performance.  Not one.  And Oswald was at best a medium shot.  The scope was defective on it, too.  I mean this is the whole essence of the case to me.  The guy couldn't do the shooting.  Nobody could.  And they sold this lemon to the American public.
That means we gotta subpoena Time- Life on it.
Welcome, District Attorney Garrison. May I call you Jim?
How much more?
Well, I'd ask Guy - we were friendly, you know - heart attack, wasn't it?
You have other information?
Why did Guy beat you, Jack?
Well, believe what you want, boss, but we got to be more careful.  All these new volunteers, any one of them could be...
I'm going to be very frank with you. You've done a great job, an astounding job considering the limited resources available to you.  But the best you can ever hope for is to stir up a lot of confusion.  You're not going to do this country any good, and you're not going to do yourself any good.  You don't belong here.  On this Mickey Mouse street with that cheap strip of bail bond shops.
Tomorrow I'll talk to your probation officer. Karen's a good kid, but she's mad at you, because you lied to her. This business about your grandmother's funeral
But you didn't ask permission. You broke a trust. If you had asked, Karen probably would have let you. I'm sure she would.
But then you told her you were home.
Does he have the marked bills on him?
I doubt it.  Who's your friend?
Let me have a word outside with Agent Nicolet for a moment?
Can we stop for cigarettes?
I don't think so.
Couldn't we just stop at a seven- eleven?
I'd love one, but not there.
Is it dark?
That doesn't sound dark.
'Cause I look like I just got outta jail, that's why. You droppin' me off at home, right? There's a place by me.
If you're having some.
He had his doubts at first. But he's always trusted me an wants more than anything to believe he still can.
He needs me. Without me all that money is just gonna sit over there in Cabo. Sugar?
Will Ordell go for that?
He was here?
I called you last night.
You think he's got a thing for you?
I don't follow your logic. What does his being nice to you have to do with him wanting Ordell's money?
I see.
Has he hinted around?
You know some interesting people.
It'll be more than that.
But you still have to show him the money at the airport.
Where's the rest of it?
What if he checks it?
You're takin' a helluva chance kid.
Then you're out and you get nothing.
You're gonna have surveillance all over you.
In a dress.
I didn't use you, Max.
I never lied to you.
We're partners.
And what would this be, Sweet and Low?
I know what it looks like.
...Compton with a fifty-six-year- old petty thief -- woman named Simone Hawkins.
Not yet.
White girl named Melanie Ralston. Another girlfriend of Ordell's.
It was her coke I got busted with. She knows everything, but she's not part of it, and she's pissed cause she's not part of it. Ordell wouldn't even let her stay at the meeting. She tried to talk me into ripping off Ordell.
I'm sure that was the idea.
I smiled and walked away. She also told me Ordell killed Beaumont.
Uh-huh.
She didn't say.
Uh-huh.
Killian's.
Uh-uh.
Well, then, why don't you be a good hostess and make me a screwdriver?
I'm tellin' you, those cops been fuckin' wit your mind. They turn black against black, that's how they do.
You told them that?
What the fuck's that got to do with it?
Give it to the bail bondsman, Max Cherry. He'll take care of it.
That was taken at a place called "Flippers." It was in Hollywood. Were you in L.A. back then?
Where were you?
With Ordell?
Jesus Christ, get a grip, Louis.
I got me five M-60 machine guns. These came straight from the Gulf War. I sold me three of them so far, twenty grand a piece.
Louis, this is it, man. I'm gonna make me a million dollars out of this. I already got me a half-a- million sittin' in Mexico. When I do this last delivery, I'm gonna make me another half-million.
She tryin' to work your ass against me, ain't she?
You didn't even hafta say it. I know the woman.
'Cause she my fine little surfer gal. She can't do me no harm. Fact she think she can play you against me shows how little she knows. You could teach that bitch for days how it is 'tween me an you, she never understand a damn word.
I don't hafta trust her, I know her.
Jesus Christ.
You know who I saw in the dress department?
I didn't really think anything of it. No -- I did wonder what he was doing there, but didn't think it had anything to do with us. You know like maybe he was there with his wife or girlfriend.
He takes off and I gotta go to Kentucky to bring him back, you pay the expenses.
You know who this is?
Get that for me, will ya baby?
Remember?
It's all been a dream.
You have an unusual hand.
Listen, will you listen? They're trying to get me. They're comin' out of the walls. The army's done something to me. I need you.
Not me, buddy.
And how is your wife? Sarah, no?
Ah!
Hmm. I don't suppose there are too many philosophers in the post office?
Last I heard you were offered a posi- tion in the West somewhere. Tuscon was it?
Jacob, if it was any other brain but yours, I might agree.  Tell me, does your lady friend know what a brilliant thinker, what a sub- lime intellect she's living with?
I'm not dead. I am not dead.
Thanks.  What's that?
Who? Jed?
Eli. Why can't you remember their names?
They're Biblical. They were prophets.
And where do you think Jezebel comes from?
You're a real heathen, you know that, Jezzie? Jesus, how did I ever get involved with such a ninny?
Yeah, but for what?
And look what I got.
I must have been out of my head.
What's in here?
You okay?
Oh, come on. It's early.
We're at Della's.
What do you mean? Where do you think?
Why? What for?
Help me! Help me!
Who was that?
How?
It's going to be all right, Jake. It's going to be all right. Don't be afraid. I've got you now.
None of us can remember that night. I get flashes of it but they don't make sense. We saw shrinks for years. But nothing they did could ever touch it. What happened? Was there ever an offensive?
But there was an attack. I can still see them coming. There was a fight, wasn't there?
How 'bout over there?  No wait. Do me a favor. Bring 'em to the back room.
Well, don't we look better this morning? That was a hard night, wasn't it?
Lennox Hospital.
You look awake to me. Here.  Drink some of this.
No. No. You haven't had any visitors.
I'm sorry.
Can I help you?
I don't have all day, kid.
Can we blow it with just two?
Sergeant!
Shit!
We'd need charges.
Get them in the lab!
Ok Sarge, what's your status?
Kicker, anything?
Kkinsa, open the goddamn door!
They were all wrong. They couldn't control him.
Rizzo, pull away!
Now hold on! We should hear her out!
Push off toward us.
Oh my God . . . what the hell is . . .
Jesus!
I'm surrounded by idiots.
Do I have to?
What?
Now lay back we need to do some tests and I have some questions...
It's okay, he just wanted his machete.
You're not going to the ocean with that, are you son?
Do me this favor just once. Use the ponds.
Just a favor for your old man.
How -- if they're gonna keep on breaking?
He can't stay down with three barrels on him! Where is he?!
Be careful.
Colorful, isn't he?
Nothing to worry about -- I'll survive this.
Why not, Larry? We could get a positive confirmation that way.
Dynamite!  How was your day...?
He didn't have a dinghy aboard. I'm going down to take a look at his hull.
We will. There's something I've got to find out.
Quint...?
I'd like to tell you what we're doing so far. These are some of the steps I've taken as Chief of Police...
...push this? Oh. It's working. Hello, Martin?
I just wanted to know if you were all right... the Coast Guard let me use their radio. Is Chief Brody there?
Well... is everything all right?
Watch it! Compressed air -- you screw around with one of those and Boom! Careful, huh?
Bull shark scraped me while I was taking samples...
I'm sorry, Martin. She's in a sick, terrible state.
Oh, I couldn't copy your work.
Oh yeah. I'm kind of a deadbeat lab partner, huh?
Charisma?
We're getting a stretch limo.
You're mad. Why are you mad?
They could be utterly negligent. Maybe they'll do a far shittier job of raising a kid than my dumbass stepdaughter ever would. Have you considered that?
What is your job title, exactly?
I said, what-is-your-job-title, Missy?
Well I'm a nail technician, and I think we both ought to stick to what we know.
We don't even have a dog!
Wow, dream big!
Whoah. I don't want to see pictures. I don't need to be notified of anything. Can't we just kick it old school? I could just put the baby in a basket and send it your way. You know, like Moses in the reeds.
Behold, good sir! The very first photo of your future child.
Juno was nice enough to bring this by for us.
Wow, I actually feel like less of a fat dork now.
Can I take your coats?
Oh my God...
Hi. I'm here for the big show?
Damn skippy, you're not! You don't even remember to give Liberty Bell her breathing meds.
So what's the prognosis, Fertile Myrtle? Minus or plus?
Best to just tell them, man. Rip off the Band-Aid and let it bleed.
God, you're getting huge. How many months has it been now?
I wish my funbags would get bigger.
What do you think? Custard or Cheesecake?
Well, I wanted to pick something gender-neutral for now. Once we get the baby, God willing, we can create a more decisive palette.
I think I'm leaning toward Custard in this light. I don't know. I should paint a small area...
What to Expect says that readying the baby's room is an important process for women. It's called "nesting."
You should read the book. I even flagged the "daddy chapters" for you.
You lose!
Early don't think women should smoke or curse or drink liquor.
My momma's a beautician. Guess that's where I get it from. She wouldn't hear of my moving in with Early... on account of his just getting out of jail and all. Ain't seen her in nearly a year now. I wish she'd call me, just once.
Carryin' a gun.
An' resistin' arrest... At least that's what the Police said.
Did you settle things with Mr. Diebold?
Oh, n'jus what in hell you crying 'bout? I'm the one got hit.
This the book your writing?
This guy killed a mess of people.
Henry Lucas.
So tell me... what happened here?
So how's it going?
...And all I'm saying is I think we ought to try and get along with them. That's all.
Carrie.
Carrie... stop it.
Sometimes... Don't know why it is... I get so hot I can't stand it. I just start sweating like a dog. You ever get like that?
...The police were way out of line when they stopped you from beating that bartender half to death. And no doubt God'll be pickin' on you on Judgement Day...
What do you think?
Telly.
Did she suck your dick?
Why?
It is right.
It's no big deal, right?
Yeah. The way I see it. My outlook on the this situation is.  It's like getting fame, you know what I'm saying. It's like, if you died tomorrow, and fifty years from now all the virgins you fucked are gonna remember you because you were their first.
You wanna run by the park and see what everybody's doing? Get zooted?
Nah.
Sup. Sup.
Uh huh.
You know it won't hurt. I'll be gentle. I promise.
Miss, would I be prying?
No, not everything? The sun is still shinning. It's a beautiful day out. Some things are OK. Right?
Did you and your boyfriend just break up?
Are you in trouble with the law?
Like where are your erogenous zones?
Yeah. And sex is just like, yeah let's have sex.
I made her get tested with me because I didn't want to go alone.
So, how many people live here now?
Where does everyone sleep?
By yourself?
You don't tell us how to run our investigation.  You got that?
The message!  I figured out--
You still having a problem with this?
It doesn't make sense because we don't understand it.
Hello?
You know her?
Why her?
But you said you didn't know her.
Just like who?
I'm just trying to play the game.
Hello, Peter.
Emotional?  I expected more from you.
By that time the game will be over.
Sure.  We've got a modem line hooked up with the data base in New York.
No problem.  We're in.
Feeling better?
You don't want to believe it.  It's a normal reaction.
What are you doing up?
I see.  You forgot to bring you're night-light, didn't you?
You want to sleep in my bed tonight?
This is where he forced his way in.  We found some fibers on the windowsill, probably particles of clothing that rubbed off when he climbed through. I'll know more once I get it under the microscope.
His home would be... Mount Olympus.
And what if he's wrong.  If you were one hundred percent sure it was Peter you would've arrested him.  If it is someone else then he's going to kill again tonight and you're sitting here ignoring the message.
This stinks!  You want to know what I think?  I think there have been five murders and you've got shit to go on. You need to blame someone and he's the easiest choice.
What have you come up with on the riddle?
Maybe, but I don't think so.  I think it's just a tease.
Where were you last night?
Answer the question.
What do you see here?
What are you looking for?
I know you didn't
Doesn't that scare you?
Why?
Did you call?
If we could just figure out what the next word is going to be.  He said the game's going to end tonight so there's only going to be one more word.
I don't trust you to wash behind your ears.
Yes.
But it opens onto the sheer wall of the Needle. There's no way down.
I am too old to climb down a rope.
Traitor! She'll marry you in hell!
Slayers!
I just remembered I have urgent business in this direction.
I'm not hungry.
Make for the wall. I'll catch up.
I'm hungry.
Passable, pimple, very passable.
He will come for me.
Can you see?
I'll stay behind and keep them busy.
I cannot stop the sand.
You will come with me.
Why can't I have a bank account?
What's up? I don't feel you're concentrated.
Not taken.
Mathilda, hadn't you told that bullshit to the receptionist, we'd still be in the hotel, I make you notice.
...No...
Yes?
Huh! You made an error, baby.  I don't know any Danielle.
Huh? Move back, baby, I can't see anything.
Is he still alive?
Huh? Are you Alfredo's son, then?
Uncle Maurice, you're wearing sneakers?
What would you like us to do?
A.P.B.... He isn't breaking any law.  He's a grown man... He can crawl on his hands and knees to China if that's what he wants to do.
We're very sorry about that.  Some of our men were on the scene of the accident.
How long does this... Mania last?
I know what you're getting at.
I've seen it before.
You're feeling old and you want to start exercising.  A lot of men your age feel the need to recapture their youth.  Don't feel embarrassed about it.
You should start slow and easy -- fifteen minutes a day.
Why do you polish that thing all the time?
Your father?
That's okay -- really it is.
What's his story?
Red flag, man.
There was a boy named Isaac who wanted to play baseball, but he was too small and no one would let him play... but he kept practicing by himself -- waiting... He went to every game and sat in the stands with his glove.
What happened?
I'm really lost.  What does this have to do with walking?
Mr. Parker, you can yell at me, if it'll help.  But I'm not risking your life.
You look so happy -- how long have you been married?
Isn't it illegal to drink and drive?
No, I came here to drink... myself... you know...
I'm rambling. I really like you. You make me want to talk... I don't know what time it is.
Want a drink? Great nap. Wanna go out tonight?
How are you doing?
Well -- I was prepared for worse, but it wasn't so bad. We were sitting at the bar, talking about blackjack. You seemed just fine, a little drunker than usual, but nothing really strange, but then your head started to droop and I put my arm on your shoulder and then, wham, you swung you arm at me, and fell backwards off your stool into a cocktail waitress. You smashed everything on her tray, it was a real mess. You kept yelling and yelling.
I tried to shut you up and help you to your feet but you kept swinging at me -- not like you wanted to hit me, but more just waving me away. Security came and when you saw them you stopped yelling. They wanted to carry you out and dump you on the street, but I talked them into letting me walk you out.
I told them you were an alcoholic and I would take you home. I also promised that we would never come in there again.
I like it here with you.
Please don't raise your voice. I won't bother you about it again.
Have you told anyone that I'm here?
I'm a Delta Gamma and I'm a huge fan of yours!
Did you hear a shot fired?
So at some point in the -- twenty minutes you were in the shower, your father was shot?
Did you get it?
What did you see when you entered the house?
Was she carrying a weapon?
You can't even imagine.
Good one.
Donovan asked to see you before you leave.
Honey, stop! You have to leave this room -- it's been a week.
You have Stromwell.
No, but she made me cry once. Not in class -- I waited until I got to my room, but yeah, she can pretty much shrivel your balls -- or you know, your whatevers.
Mrs. Windham Vandermark?
Hey --
Girls -- I'm going to Harvard!
Maiden name -- Daniels.  You know her?
Elle, believe me, I never expected to be doing this, but I think it's the right thing to do.
I have to think about my future. And what people expect from me.
East coast people are different.
I told you, Elle. I need someone -- serious.
Pink ones.
Is it a Kappa?
You go?  Not watch fun?
When the time's come, you won't need to jump, I'll throw you out myself!
No, wait... please... listen...
Elderberry wine.  No finer drink under heaven.
Are ye afraid of me wine?  Did your momma tell ye never to take food nor drink from the Wee Folk?  Think if ye sup with the faeries you'll be enchanted?
Generally known!  What general ever knew more than to lace up his boots?
There be no finer victuals than worm flesh, lad.
How do we follow a raven we can't even see?
Shhh!  Not so loud, mayhap he'll hear ye.
Certainly understandable.
Is she... dead?
We're blind now.  Oona was our eyes and ears.  How do we find the Castle Couer de Noir without her?
Easily said... the raven passed this way hours ago.
Never knowing when it takes a turn or changes course.
Tells you something 'bout him what lives there...
Why not mine the damned walls?
Will you explain what's going on?
Keep me belly full, Jack.  Kill us another worm.
Aye... my Lord...
How much longer?
I am a princess.  You have no right to order me about.
No!  I won't let it happen...
It's the Baron's damnable work!  Too cowardly to stand and fight... he used you to save himself.
What?
Sunlight?
So, he's hiding in the dark...
No!  Don't let go... you mustn't!  I love you!
Here be the death weapon; the unicorn's blood dry upon it.
He chopped off the horn and left the rest to rot.
How do I get the horn back?
Where do I find the Baron's castle?
Not very precise directions.
Nay.  Tempting as your invitation be.  Tell me one thing more.
What became of the princess?
Princess Lili, Godwin's daughter. She was with me when calamity struck, but after I could find no trace of her.
Exceeding fair.
Twould be to compare one star with another in the summer sky.
No!
I don't believe you.
Is this a May Day pageant?  Are you all off on a lark...?  The raven passed this way hours ago!
Maybe there's a better idea... What about birds... get a lift from some friendly bird...
Is he a friend, then?
And we got to take all the old paint off all the doors and then George taught us how to stain everything and he even let me choose the color I liked best!  And he said he loved me!
So put your plans of my room in the trash.
Atonement.
Did you feel anything?
Huh?
You hate your father.
You'd hate him for the trick.
Funny how he's the architect and you're just a loud mouth cop.
Right...she married...what was he?
Peter Webber!  Right.  Quite the spotlight on that guy.
Sam?
I didn't recognize you!
Alyssa said you don't even have plumbing over there.
Your mom and the boys can drop by anytime.
I'll be around to check up on you.
Because I live there.
I hate turkey.
Oh, so you're in the big shit now!  Child abuse.  People go to prison for what you just did to me.
Are you talking?
Sun glasses?
Why wouldn't she leave?
I would have killed him.
I'd eat a lot of red meat.
Mr. Dokos called to complain that you and a boy are squatting illegally in the garage of your house.
He never answers.
We're fine.  Turkey sandwiches.
I thought you'd be up with the sun.
Do you know Alyssa thinks something is up with us?  She's giving me crap about being away from Peter and now you're trying to do the same thing!  What no one seems to realize is that Peter isn't there!  He's not there!  And when he is, he isn't!  So, if you don't want me here, or you don't want my kids here, just tell me, George.  I'll stop coming.  But it won't be because of Peter.  It'll be because you asked me to stop.  Say what you need to say, because I'm not leaving until I hear it.
I better get the kids home.
We've eaten.
That sounds pathetic, doesn't it?
I've missed you guys.
Ryan, would you rather swim or work?
These are free papers.
Forty years. That's a long time for any crime, even murder.
Half the men in this prison swear they're innocent. Don't you think that's kinda funny?
Season tickets to the Yankees. Right there on the first base line.  What's wrong, baby?
What I want to know is what happened to your cush between the time that you got up from the table and when I caught up with you in the Johnny?
I said you're soft.
I wouldn't do that if I was you.
What's up, Ray?
Sure is hot today. Think it'll rain later?
What do I want? What makes you think I want something?
Your daddy must have been a helluva guy, a deep man, a wise man. Sure wish I could have met him --
You still got that map?
Well, if you're still thinking about booking it, I want in. I think we can make it.
Look, my cousin Maynard is a lawyer. He filed an appeal on my behalf --
The appeal was denied. Then Daisy went and fell for Maynard. They're engaged to be married, can you believe that?
Come on, man. Don't shut me out. I'm telling you, you and me, that map, we can go places.
Hundred and Sixty First Street? That's Yankee Stadium.
Red Sox... Who's on the mound?
Allie Reynolds. He's my boy.
I know people.
You get ketchup?
You show them Crawfords how to play ball.
Damn, it was getting hot in there.
You didn't think I was gonna let you escape alone, did you?
Then you're lucky I came along. Doesn't take a visionary to spot a golden opportunity like this. Now help me out of this trunk.
Come on, man, I'm starting to cramp up here.  We have the chance right here, right now, I say we go!
Back to New York for starters.
This boat's gonna sail without you, too. I don't care if I last one day out here. At least it's one day of freedom. Now gimme those keys.
Claude, man, I'm serious. Give me those keys.
Don't make me take them away from you.
I can't eat this.
Alright, well, let's say you make it to Greenville. What's there, anyway?
Alright, listen up! I want every man lined up out here in the yard on the double! Let's move it!
Man, you really bummed me out. That's a terrible story.  Nigger, you crying?
I can't believe this. I always said I'd never end up like this. I thought I'd make something of myself, do something with my life. You know, be successful. Have a big house, a family. Now I'm gonna end up just like daddy.
They gave me life, mama.
Mr. Johnson is very well connected. If you were to let us go, I guarantee he would show you his appreciation, if you know what I mean.
I'm just trying to pay the toll on the road to justice.
Couple years back, Cookie made it clear to Greenville.
You don't have to drown that fella, Spanky. You already scared him half to death. He didn't know who he was fucking with.
Welcome to the party. It's so nice to see all of you here.
Thank you, Nicky. Cause now I'm gonna bust Adrian's head wide open.
I'll call her later.
Valerie's crying!
Oh my God, he just opened his mouth and swallowed that spit.
Your brothers are upsetting the balance of good and evil.
You can't do jack shit... unless you learn your evil powers.
Go get a soda out of the fridge.
I got no ears! I can't hear!
To do that Cassius and Adrian have to come back through the other way.
Bus?
Easy, Liberace.
Looking for the chief.
Good idea... kill me.
Valerie, it feels like there's a bunch of butterflies flapping around in my stomach. Is that normal?
We're going to Jersey?
A little strange. I can't stop thinking about this girl, Valerie.
How do you think we got here??!!
Do you have anything special in mind?
The damned Yellows are getting out of hand. Those three ought to be in Cathedral. No business scrambling in Arcade...
That's right. The other one came after. The older one. Smashing, killing, burning!
Why show me?
Why tell me?
About running, dying what?
I know what everyone knows. Try like hell for Renewal. You have the same chance everyone else has.
Are you taking me to them?
Because he's my friend --  and I don't want to be killed by him -- or anyone.
Will he find us and kill us? Yes... or one of the others.  You know there's only one place to go now...
I'd rather take my chances with them... than with Francis.
You think Sandmen will?  There's no other way for me,
It's getting dark and cold. I'm tired.
That sweet madman -- how could he come to exist?
What belongs to the people?
What people?
But there may be a few around somewhere.
My parents thought so. Mother and Father. You know?
That's better than gold when it's cold.
My father was the husband and my mother was the wife. "Beloved" is a word they used -- to stay together.
You want somethin'?
Very strange.
You recognize that guy?
Have you partied with him?
Where's the bathroom?
Sheila?
How about Madison? Have we had even a hint of his whereabouts?
What's the matter?
There's no other bedroom?
What's that?
Who's it from?
Does it say anything on the tape?
What the hell is going on?!
Andy would go for this, don't you think?... Firing squad, definitely.
The heart, I guess.
Her name is Alice. You know I love that girl to death. If I ever found out somebody was makin' out with her, I'd take this...  ...and shove it so far up his ass it would come out his mouth... Then you know what?...
You still care about me?
All of it?
Yes, sir.
Yes, it just shows  I don't know why I'm talking to you. I don't know you. Who are you?
Don't call me brother.
Yeah? If this be execution, lead me to it.
Uh-huh. You're a scream, Lovey.
Hey Lovey, come here! Lovey, I asked for a glass of wine and look what I got. Come on, sit down.
You were asked to have a glass of wine. Sit down!
Yes. Unbosom yourself, Mr. Hyde.[11]
There you are! Barnard, you'd better get your things together. We're leaving.
Yes. I've just been talking with the porters. They're going to take us. We've got clothing, food, everything. Come on!
Right this very minute!  The porters are waiting for us on the plateau. And that Chinaman thought he could stop me. Come along.
You mean you don't want to go?
I see. You're afraid of going to jail, eh?
All right! If you insist on being an idiot, I'm not going to waste time coaxing you.  How about you?
That would suit me perfectly. I'm always broke. How did you pay for them?
buy and sell?
I see. Gold for ideas. You know Mr. Chang, there's something so simple and naive about all of this that I suspect there has been a shrewd, guiding intelligence somewhere. Whose idea was it? How did it all start?
Who?
When was all this?
He amputated his own leg?
Well, they didn't actually mean that.
Well, is it?
108 and still active?
Oh, no. Just a little bowled over, that's all.
Very often.
That's all very fine if it works out. A little amazing, of course.
I surprise you? Now that's news.
Mr. Chang, if you don't mind, I think I'll go on being amazed - in moderation, of course.
Amazing, Mr. Chang. This place is amazing! And that marble quarry in the valley is simply magnificent. Oh, I've looked around. I've seen everything. Your woodworkers and your cloth-weavers - they all seem so very, very happy.
You may not know it, Mr. Chang, but right here you have Utopia.[15]
I don't mean it in that sense. I only give credit where credit is due.  Er, Mr. Chang, I'm very anxious to have you realize that I never for a moment believed that ridiculous kidnapping story.
Simply preposterous. Do you know what I did last night? Last night, Mr. Chang, I held a sort of a self- inventory. I said to myself last night, Mr. Chang, I said, "Lovey"  Mr. Lovett! "Mr. Lovett," I said, "you are an ungrateful fool . . . "
"Ungrateful fool . . . !"  Those were my very words to myself last night. "Here are these people in Shangri-La doing everything in their power to make our stay comfortable and happy and I haven't done one single thing to show my appreciation."
Well, Mr. Chang, I thought, with your permission of course, and while I'm waiting for these porters, I would like to organize classes for those children in the valley and teach them something practical and something useful. Geology.
Isn't it? Isn't it! You know I was a professor for twenty years? - and a very good one.
Oh, immediately.
Oh, thank you. Thank you!
Sit here, near me. I am an old man and can do no one any harm.
Bob, these are all that are left.
What is it? Has he fainted?
For heaven's sake, Bob, what's the matter with you? You went out there for the purpose of
She was kidnapped and brought here two years ago just as we were, Bob.
Imagine having all that fuel there, waiting for us!  George, something tells me our journey is just beginning.
What is?
I'm sorry. I thought I was to be the light. But why do I confuse you? Am I so strange?
I'm so glad.
Perhaps because you've always been a part of Shangri-La without knowing it.
I'm sure of it. Just as I'm sure there's a wish for Shangri-La in everyone's heart. I have never seen the outside world. But I understand there are millions and millions of people who are supposed to be mean and greedy. Yet I just know that secretly they are all hoping to find a garden spot where there is peace and security, where there's beauty and comfort, where they wouldn't have to be mean and greedy. Oh, I just wish the whole world might come to this valley.
Now that dinner is over, if you'll excuse us, we're very anxious to discuss ways and means of getting back home.
...touch that.
Kids' game a couple galaxies over.
Everybody, listen up: we've had a tremendous amount of movement lately. Be aware.  Be safe.  Have a good day.  Oh, uh... Cowan?
I wasn't scared...
The point is to not call attention to ourselves.
Well, Mr. Intuition... When the neighbors report screaming and we hear nothing but silence, what does that lead you to believe?
Or someone has a nitrogenizer.
Where's it coming?  Where's he landing?
It's marble.
Sure.
What do we do?
What the hell does that mean?
Not bad.  Briliiant, actually.  You come unarmed, and alone.  Cause your army's been growing underground for what? 100 years? 150?
I just wanted to scare em.  So I go in to buy a starter's pistol-- you know, the kind they use at track meets that shoot blanks-- and this guy, he said if I really wanted to mess with with them, he had just the thing...
Jupiter, actually. well, one of the moons.
And get this: you know how humans evolved from primates?  Well guess what the dominant life form on planet evolved from?
No.  Follow him.
She's not alive, but she didn't die.
From where?  D.C.?
You the only sentry?
You understand that a week from now people are going to vote on whether or not what we've been doing down here has been some noble-minded enterprise or a chance to change the way this country fights crime.
People want to believe in the system.  That's the beauty of it...
Somewhere near the capital?
The mall?
I'm sorry Danny, but I'll have to give you the full tour later on.
You set me up...
Just go to the beginning!
I won!
It floated back up.  I had to take him out and --
Just what is it you think I can do for you?
This is all my fault.
Congratulations, sir.
According to the Sentry, Anderton was watching this at Containment right before he was tagged.
I did find it.  It was inside of Agatha all this time.  So the question is, why would someone want this erased from the data file?
I'm thinking someone got away with murder.
The information we need is embedded in the grain of wood.  And since each piece is unique, the shape and grain is impossible to duplicate.
I worked homicide before I went federal.  This is what we would've called an "orgy of evidence".  Do you know how many orgies I had as a homicide copy, Gordon?
My name is Danny Witwer.  I'm --
Wally, the other two can still function, right?
Are you telling me they can't see murders anymore?
Okay. We got a lot happening here. Here comes the good part... Okay...
You're not my daddy.
I never promised you anything.
Goodbye, Bobby.
Don't you get it? I don't want to leave. This is who I am.
How bad is it?
When's it going down?
Yes, for expenses and such. Now, you'll be contacted on your pager as to where you should go. You each have been given an extra battery, so there is absolutely no excuse as to why a page would not be immediately returned. Am I making myself abundantly clear?
Now listen. The gig couldn't be simpler. You carry the money to the Welshman, he checks it, hands you his marker, you're done. The washed money goes directly to Maxie. Long as you hand off the bag, you're tight.
Yeah... Mmmm, that sounds good... Uhu...
I'm on the phone.
So's this.  Hey baby... Oh, nothing. What were you saying?
Nice work.
How'd you unlock my phone?
'Cardiff Giant.' That's us.
Yeah.
Nothing, man.
We rep lines? You know? Fashion?
Kinda. Yeah.
Yes?
Yes.  Would you care for another one?
And where is...?
No?
Well, I didn't care for the club much. And, I must say, I didn't care for him either.
Good morning.
Nah, man...
dollars in c-notes, a numeric pager, a double-A battery, and a first class round-trip ticket to JFK.
Yes. You're going to New York.
That money is your per diem.
Who's gonna outfit us?
Sombitch and I ain't never been to Beantown.
It hit?
Take it easy, baby.
Sure, burn yourself, pain yourself, put all that poison into your hair, into your body -- trying to be white.
Sure, white man throw us a bone and that's supposed to make us forget 400 years.
What can I do for you?
Women talk too much. To tell a woman not to talk is like telling Jesse James not to carry a gun or a hen not to cackle. And Samson, the strongest man that ever lived, was destroyed by the woman who slept in his arms.
I never told you, but when I first saw you on the podium, cleaning your glasses, I felt sorry for you. Nobody as young as you should be that serious. But I don't think that anymore.
I want to also, but until we are instructed by the Messenger to do so, we will just wait and pray.
Mr. X is a demagogue. He has no place to go, so he exaggerates. He's a disservice to every good law-abiding Negro in the country. Can I ask you a question?
Mr. Malcolm X, why do you teach black supremacy? Why do you teach hate?
Is she hooking?
Thank you, Brother; Sister, how are you?
You had the number.
Don't never try to cross someone who ain't afraid to die.
Only a pig could do a thing like that.
Creasy...  I'd have liked to have known you under different circumstances.
I traced the PIN. I have an address for you. But I need to see you.
Deal.
[Drive.]
[Yeah.  Yes.]
[What do you mean?]
Is it loaded?
It's not exactly a scam, Crease. Even at half speed you're pretty damn good.
Cut the stock here. The barrel here. Make sure you file it smooth.  Rocket launchers?
And don't start crying.
Doesn't matter. I always finish second.
The gunshot holds no fear. Say it.
Mr. Creasy, I wanted to make sure you have everything you need.
Is the food alright? Maria tells me that you didn't eat.
Rosanna Guerrero.
Where are you?
Last night. Do you know something?
Could he speak English? Emilio couldn't speak English.
I think it's nice he's American.
[Is it true? Creasy saved the little girl that was kidnapped yesterday.]
Hey, Herbie...
You wanna have a drink before we start dancing?
Who you gonna call?
Are you kidding?
Ufa!
You gotta real nice face, you know? It's really a nice face.
So I was telling you, my kid brother Nickie got married last Sunday. That was a very nice affair. And they had this statue of some woman, and they had whiskey spouting outta her mouth. I never saw anything so grand in my life.  And watta meal. I'm a butcher, so I know a good hunka steak when I see one. That was choice filet, right off the toppa the chuck. A buck eighty a pound. Of course, if you wanna cheaper cut, get rib steak. That gotta lotta waste on it, but it comes to about a buck and a quarter a pound, if it's trimmed. Listen, Clara, make yourself comfortable. You're all tense.
You want me to take you home, I'll take you home.
You don't think my sister Catherine should live in her daughter-in-law's house?
Where do you think a mother-in-law should go?
Well, maybe that's what they teach you in New York University. In real life, it don't work out that way. You wait till you are a mother.
I always figure a guy oughta marry a girl who's twenny years younger than he is so that when he's forty, his wife is a real nice-looking doll.
Oh, we got plenny-a room here.
That was a nice girl last night, Marty.  She wasn't a very good-looking girl, but she looks like a nice girl.  I said, she wasn't a very good-looking girl... not very pretty...
She looks a little old for you. About thirty-five, forty years old?
I'm with a girl, Ralph.
I can't do that, Ralph, because somebody already brushed her off once tonight.
I just wanna thank you people again, because the situation was just becoming impossible.
Well, I'll tell you, Aunt Theresa...
Okay.
We wanted to tell you how you were helping us with your fixes.
You boys'll have to go to work early.
It certainly isn't Henry's fault Hot Lips Houlihan doesn't like her name.
Us. Lead us not into...
What do you think of that piece of scenery, Yankee boy?
Best equipped dentist in the whole goddam Army. Care to have a look, a man with your background?
Never heard of him.
Let's hear from you, you goddam Yankee. Be nice to see you some time.
If we had closer relations, there wouldn't be any misunderstandings. That's where a football game would help. Between your outfit and mine.
Special Services in Tokyo are all for it. They say it's one of the main gimmicks we have to keep the American way of life going here in Asia.
You mean Hot Lips? Screw her.
Radar!
We stand behind all our work.
Please!  Face it, Colonel, you don't have us, we have you. Your boys blew this case, we bailed you out. We figure we ought to hang around a day to check the Congressman's kid, and we also figure to play some golf. So if that's okay with you, we got a deal.
It's five minutes into nurses' shower hour. Where are they?
What's the matter?
You please excuse...  I have been making examination of this young man to find if he will be soldier in our army.
I don't liking it at all, what I hear when I listen to the heart. And such a blood pressure for so young a boys. Is frightening.
At first is no doubt. But then I am seeing on his paper he work in American hospital. And I think there are so many drugs in such a places, he could take some by mistake.
He's coming to.
Good morning, Captain Pierce and Captain Forrest.
I have not understood what you means.
You work those kind of hours, you got to have rest. Which you can't get with somebody jabbering away on a direct line to heaven.
We got it, men... Ho-Jon's keep as Androscoggin... if there is such a place. And the big news is, the General wants a rematch.
Well, there's one big satisfaction.
How is he?
Yeah. No, no!  No! No, look. You don't have to smell the world! 
Never mind those guys. All right, stand up. Now let's see what you look like when you protest.
Against anything. Just protest.
Oh, look. I'm the umpire, and you just cut the heart of the plate with your fast one and I call it a ball. What would you do?
Yes!
Ted Sheldon.
Oh! Oh, it's beautiful, D. B. WellI don't quite know what to say . . .
Yeh, D. B. Oh, just cleaning out the dead-wood. Okay.
That's fine! That's fine!  Now fall right into their laps. Go ahead. Say John Doe walked in and called the whole thing off. You know what that's going to sound like on top of this!
Okay, fellows.
No sense in going up there! I been here for hours. He ain't here!
Hey, Boss.
St-rike!
It makes no difference, Bertthe ideas's still good. We don't have to give up our club.
I trust him.
Go down to the office and arrange for some radio time.
I want it as soon as possible.
What's your name?
I bet you he'd know how to say it all right. And me, I get up to it and around it and in back of it, but, but I never get right to it. Do you know what I mean? So the only chance I've got is, well, if somebody could kinda give her a warning sort of, sorta prepare her for the shock!
They're not usually graduate students.
Duke Ellington. "Things Ain't What They Used To Be", recorded July 30, 1945.
Who's controlling your mind?
What?!
You don't have to come here.
Same here. I've watched you in action. Very impressive.
Come on. Let's go for a drink.
You have to. It's a tradition.
Nah, I just throw that in because I enjoy it.
You could say something like,  "Tell me what the scumbag's name is. Maybe we can work something out."
We need the 4 and 6 to finish to first and second.
There's your answer. He's smart.
I know how you feel, Ray.
Yeah. I'm sorry.
How's Paco doing?
I've never seen sea so blue. Tahiti is magnificent, Scottie.
Roper.
Are you going to make this hard for me?
There's been some concern about you continuing to work without back-up.
God-Damn you!
You were right.
But what would happen to me?  I have no body to return to.
Where the hell are you going?
And what about the reconfiguration?
Get some internal police there. Tell them to run a perimeter.
The only way to eject it is from the inside.
An interface attendant.
That's why they told you you can't go inside.  They can't have you running into her.
What's so funny?
Why not?
We've got him locked!
He wants to know if you'd like a cube of sugar in your tea.
Anybody see anything?
Ay, yi, yi!  The Rangers are going to be CRUSHED!
That's the only way to the Monolith...
FOUR SECONDS TO IMPACT!
It's... an eagle?
... A falcon?
But boss, what about their parents?
Rrgh mmffpprr brghuh!!
There seems to be some confusion about your registration. I believe I can find you a place at the Ambassador. Many persons of the Jewish faith find it quite...
I'm sorry, sir. Our clientele is restricted to White Anglo-Saxons.
Up here, Boss.
When the stiff's an Irish, the cops take it kinda personal.
How much longer we gotta be shut up in this fuckin' sweatbox?
You here with Bobby?
Charlie?
Meyer.
Married? To Anna?  You ain't got her in trouble?
Well, good. Woman like that you don't have to keep an eye on.
Come off it, Bugs.
Tommy tells me that Capone's coming in from Chicago.
He'll think something's wrong I ain't there.
What the fuck does that mean?
So fuck him. I don't care anymore. Let him come.
Sure. But ya got a deck a cards? I wanna play some Klob.
Tell me, my son. Why did you go with Giuseppe? He's not our kind.
We learn from life.
Strategy.
The Big Picture.
Maranzano wants you dead.
Special occasion?
Jeez, it all looks like bad late-night cable.
Three months. <i></i> There's always some brain damage. But at three months...the chances of coming back shrink dramatically with every day.
No. I want to give him <u>more</u>. I want to give him a massive dose.
Land of Death. How do I get there?
And speaking of which, here's the light of my life, the pert and saucy Miss Julie McElroy.
Stu?
Don't ask where I got it.
You're the only true-hearted man I ever met. You find a way back to that girl of yours and make her happy.
<u>He</u> got an E-ticket. Where's mine? <u>When do I get</u> <u>to wake up</u>??
I've been stuck down here for <u>months</u>. Somebody had better start paying attention, or I'm gonna - I'm gonna <u>kick ass</u>!
Stu...Stu...
I wanted to ask you something.  Those motorcycles across the street ...?
... What are they all doing there?
The motorcycle gang?  Don't they deal drugs and rape young girls?
Who is it?
She's at work.  I'm her mother.
--what possible explanation can you offer for this charge being--as you say--"trumped up" against you!
It was?
No, not yet, Senator Paine--not hide nor hair of the man. You mean to say the boys haven't--?
Did you like the first act?
I knew it! I knew a night's rest wasn't possible in this house!  Hubert!
That infernal phone!
Terrific! A born stooge! Horace'll perform like a trained seal.
Boy Ranger! The answer to a prayer. Manna from heaven! Didn't know the time of day--!
Yes! He's about to blow the whole machine to smithereens--and *you with it*, Mr. Governor!
You couldn't understand! Listen, Ten Thumbs, I'll be on my way to Washington in half an hour. Whatever happens, I'm all ready for this Ranger of yours. Never mind how. You'll get your instructions from Ken Allen here. It isn't anything you have to do. I wouldn't trust you to lick a stamp. Allen'll do it himself. You just use your *high office* to help him get it done. Understand?
No, *sir*! You couldn't do better, Dad.
Jeff for Senator.
Washington!
My pigeons--I better see about my pigeons.
Just a minute, I better make sure.
Well, it isn't much, but if you insist, here's this week's. 
Thank you, sir.
Yeah, Dad always used to say the only causes worth fighting for were lost causes.
Ma's told me about it a thousand times.
Yes, Ma found him slumped over his desk that morning...
I know. I suppose, Mr. Paine, when a fellow bucks up against a big organization like that, one man by himself can't get very far, can he?
Yes, sir, I yield for a question.
Can't you?
Yes! I've told Senator Paine for twenty years--
Go ahead--punch.
I had a lot to do with that little press conference last night--
We're going right ahead with--*what*?
One moment, Senator. Do I understand you're going to present a *Bill*?
Pardon me. Senator Paine decided this *with* you?
My dear Senator, have you the faintest idea of what it takes to get a Bill passed?
If I were *triplets*, I couldn't--. Look, Senator--let me give you a rough idea. A member has a Bill in mind--like you--a camp. Right?
Fine. Now, what does he do? He's got to sit down first and write it up. The where, when, why, how--and everything else. That takes time--
I see. *This* one is so simple--
Oh, yes. And *I'm* helping. Simple-- and I'm helping. So we knock this off in record-breaking time of--let's say three or four days--
A *day*!
Tonight.  Look--uh--I don't want to seem to be complaining, Senator--but in all civilized countries, there's an institution called *dinner*--!
Uh-huh. Well, dinner comes in on trays. We're executives. And we light into this. It is dawn. Your Bill is ready. You go over there and introduce it--
You get to your feet in the Senate and present it. Then you take the Bill and put it in a little box-- like a letter box--on the side of the rostrum. Just hold it between thumb and forefinger and drop it in. Clerks read it and refer it to the right committee--
Committee.
That's how Congress--or any large body--is run. All work has to be done by committee.
Look--committees--small groups of Senators--have to sift a Bill down-- look into it--study it--and report to the whole Senate. You can't take a Bill no one knows anything about and discuss it among ninety-six men. Where would you get?
Good. Where are we?
Yes. They give it to a *sub*- committee, where they really give it a going over--hold hearings--call in people and ask questions--then report back to the bigger committee--where it's considered some more, changed, amended, or whatever. Days are going by, Senator. Days--weeks. Finally, they think it's quite a Bill. It goes over to the House of Representatives for debate and a vote. *But* it's got to wait its turn on the calendar--
That's the order of business. Your Bill has to stand *way* back there in line unless the Steering Committee decides it is important enough to be--
What?
Do you really think we're getting anywhere.
A committee of the majority party leaders. They decide when a Bill is important enough to be moved up toward the head of the list--
Pardon me--*this* is. Where are we now?
Yes. House. More amendments--more changes--and the Bill goes back to the Senate--and *waits its turn on the calendar again*. The Senate doesn't like what the house did to the Bill. They make more changes. The House doesn't like *those* changes. Stymie. So they appoint men from each house to go into a huddle called a conference and battle it out. Besides that, all the lobbyists interested give cocktail parties for and against--government departments get in their two cents' worth--cabinet members--budget bureaus--embassies. Finally, if the Bill is alive after all this vivisection, it comes to a vote. Yes, sir--the big day finally arrives. And--nine times out of ten, they vote it down.  Are you catching on, Senator?
Pardon?
I know. Don't tell me. It was a wonderful party. Your suit went over big. And she looked beautiful, and she gave her hand when you left her-- and said--"Thank you, Mr. Smith." Oh, but it was the way she *said* it. You like to fell through the floor--Horseradish!
And you're writing Ma all about it. And your pigeons will carry the message of love. And the first thing you know--Susan Paine'll get the best jar of preserves she ever tasted!
*Gentlemen*! Gentlemen are supposed to believe in something decent. Instead of twisting facts and making a joke of everything--why don't you tell the people the *truth* for a change?
The Senator understands he is limited to five minutes?
Yeah! How about it? You're a nature lover. Do you handle any of that sign language?
Joe! You *told* him to!
Every word that boy said is the truth! I'm not fit for office! I'm not fit for any place of honor or trust in this land! Expel me--!
Here, here, Susan--this is Jeff Smith-- our new Senator.
Order!
Since he was born.
He's still pixilated.
You fainted.
Have you seen the papers?
I've often thought about going back.
Oh, yes. I used to have a lot of fun there when I was a little girl. I used to love to go fishing with my father. That's funny. He was a lot like you, my father was. Talked like you, too. Sometimes he'd let me hold the line while he smoked - and we'd just sit there for hours. And after awhile, for no reason, I'd go over and kiss him and sit in his lap. He never said very much but once I remember him saying: "No matter what happens, honey, don't complain."
Do you mind if I talk to you, Mary? You don't have to pay any attention to me.
All my life, I've wanted somebody to talk to. Back in Mandrake Falls, I always used to talk to a girl.
Just a minute. No, you don't.
He'll probably kick me right down the stairs. I only hope he does.
That's the rub.
I know, Budington. We can't afford to have the books investigated right now. You must have said that a thousand times already.
Well, it hasn't happened yet - has it?
You can't come up here!
He's not home, I tell you!
We'll send for the police!
You will please permit Mr. Deeds to finish.
Yes?
Where?
I wouldn't worry if I were you. Of course, a large fortune like this entails a great responsibility - but you'll have a good deal of help. So don't worry. Leave everything to me.
No?
This afternoon - at four o'clock.
Just as I suspected, wise guy! I don't mind you making a sap out of yourself - but you made one out of me, too.
The wrong kind! There isn't any wrong or right kind. Opera is opera!
Well, we were rather expecting it to come from you.
Naturally.
Sorry to keep you waiting so long. Those opera people are funny. They wanted me to put up $180,000.
Why, I turned them down, naturally.
Look, he's temperamental.
Uh-huh.
Well, we could borrow a couple from Mrs. Simpson. You know, she went to Niagara Falls last year.
He talks about women as if they were cattle.
Tell me, Walter, are all those stories I hear about my uncle true?
Twenty! What did he do with them?
Why, that's an echo, sir!
Me, sir?
You can go out there if you like...
But they're certainly dead. And yes, personally, I find it a bit odd.
Well... you see, when I broke it off with Phyllis, she was naturally upset and she became more determined than ever to pursue certain -- how to put it -- doubts she's been harboring...
Let me just say something here... I have no idea if this is going to help.
You remember when I asked you about pornography --
-- and you told me that. Still, there's some kind of imagery that's haunting you and, I think, getting in your way --
Are you a man who likes to treat himself right?
I am. And I'm not ashamed of it. Nobody ever said on their death bed -- "I treated myself too well."
Fill in the blank. I don't mind the office. The point is, you only go 'round once. Like the Zens say -- Be here now.
Althea hasn't told you?
Well, in '85 four of us left our firms and formed an investment banking venture. We've got twenty-three people working there now.
You're early... it's not ready. What happened?
...so rich?
It's a country club. Don't worry about it.
Finally, some common sense...
I think you know what I mean.
I think you do.
We'll take it slow. You'll never feel you can't handle it.
I don't know if I mentioned the headaches.
No, not really. They're about the same. My marriage was one long headache.
I need to talk to you... Doctor. Can I come in?
But, there is one... mitigating factor I want you to consider before you write me off.
Will you think about it?
There's this kid at school... Martin Brockett. He has some gigantic idea of himself that no one else shares. You wouldn't believe the crap he lays on me... Who appointed him my spiritual leader? If he has everything so figured out how come his best friend is a .22 rifle? And why's he spend all his time chasing after me? Probably thinks I'm gonna give him a hummer...
This is great!
Skip, you must have lots of people you can throw a ball with.
Skip, you're the head of the whole deal here. Are they busier than you?
All right, I'm just gonna tell you, as simple and direct as I can.  And you understand that this is a big secret? Just between us?  Okay. You know I've got this gift for certain kinds of... machines.
That's right. And you also know that even though I make 23% of the modems in the world... I cannot make one simple connection with any woman who could truly love me.
Of course, him being insane didn't make it all right that I fell in love with his wife.
Skip, I've got a problem and I need some advice.
That was a terrible thing.
Now go find me a big stick.
Goin' somewhere?
...and how do you say? Those slimy things, in your stomach?
I'm willin, to go on a little faith, here.
And what is he in prison for?
And what did he say?
How do you know the box pertains to Hamunaptra?
I don't believe in fairy tales and hokum, Mister O'Connell, but I do believe that one of the most famous books in history is buried out there, The Book Of The Living. It's what first interested me in Egypt as a child. It's why I came here, sort of a life's pursuit.
There's some sort of lock here. You say these thing's are made of granite with a steel interior?
Are you saying somebody threw these things in with our guy, and they slowly ate him alive?
Don't do it, Evelyn.
But he's just a filthy criminal?
Finish the inscription, idiot!
Lemme get this straight, they stuck a sharp, red hot poker up your nose, cut your brain into small pieces, then ripped it all out through your nostrils?
Believe it, sister. That's what brought our buddy back to life.
What are you doing all alone in the dark?
We could really use some coffee --
No one will believe us.
Doc, these are my friends. We're superheroes, and we need your help.
And the light goes out...
Stay away!
It's me.
You drink too much.
You sure that's how you spell it?
He doesn't miss a trick, does he?
Maybe she's right.
But... only when no one is looking.
Jeffrey!
What are you doing in the silver drawer?
Be a Mohican.
That was too close.
What do you think Napoleon will do?
Josephine dead -- how unbelievable! How impossible it is to believe it. She was always physically so strong -- she was never ill a day in her life.
Yes, sir?
Yes, sir.  I hope you will excuse me for asking, General Bonaparte, but are you Corsican?
I thought so, I noticed your name when you were announced.  I'm Corsican too -- my name is Arena.
Bastia -- and you?
Will Alexander be joining us soon?
Oh...?
Naturally, one does not take much stock in such a piece of filth but, on the other hand, it is not the sort of thing one can simply ignore. What do you think, Joseph?
And you, are you in love with any one else?
But you have had mistresses while you were away.
Were you in love with any of them?
Were they pretty?
Were any of them prettier than I am?
Were any of them married?
She must have been in love with you.
Well, anyway, sorry to call you away from the festivities, but where is the breakdown on serviceable vehicles?  I asked for it yesterday.
Why did you give it to him?
Well, he didn't give it to me, and when I ask you to do something for me, return the work to me, not to Berthier.
I must have the breakdown now. Where is Berthier?
Good evening, ladies.  You must forgive me, my dearest wife, but I simply could not wait to see you.
I suggest that you leave with your men while you can.
Led by the warlike Queen Louisa, and her fashion-minded husband, King Frederich Wilhelm, the Prussians still believed themselves cast in the mold of Frederick the Great, and more than a match for Napoleon.  The King had a special collection of 60 splendid uniforms, and was personally involved in the design of all the Prussian army uniforms.
I know you smoke weed, right?
Where you going?
Dude, dogs hate me.  I don't know why. Me and K-9's just don't get along.
Fuck, what's his name?
I can't see!  I can't see!  Daddy!
$247.
Craig, what the hell are you doing?
What you see?
Wait here?  So Cheeco can bite my ass off?  Tell me where it is I'll do it.
I got my cousin Day-Day waiting for me.
That nigga worst than them damn pit bulldogs or something!  That's why moving wit'cha Uncle Elroy and Cousin Day-Day is the best thing for you right now.
You too.
Did you see that?  That was a W.W.F. hit right there, huh, Day-Day?
I gotta think of a plan to get this money before tomorrow.
What?!  What that mean?
Uh...um...I mean uh, can we borrow a cup of sugar?
You too big.
Need to lose some weight.
During a campaign every speech is important. This is free media exposure. Primetime news coverage that we couldn't buy.
I need your help.
I...1 would like to...thank you, Mister Wat... Gene.
For what?
This is for you. In it there is a picture of a woman and an itinerary. It is her itinerary. She is presently - are you listening, Mr. Watson?
I killed you.
Yes, you're right, I don't understand.
So, come on. You never saw us kiss like that?
I have to do something.
I said I have to do something.
Keep the change.
Oh, we'll have to do better than that.
I'm not a baby.
Look at 'em. He'd do anything for her.-
He never told about the money.
What do you figure he done with it?
Ain't seen you in a coon's age, Johnny.
I'll light the lamp.
Who?
That feller's just achin' to settle down with some nice woman and make a home for himself.
If ever I saw a Sign from Heaven!
Pearl dotes on him.
What he needs is a dose o' salts!
What?
I declare, you'll let that money haunt you to your grave, Willa Harper!
I tried to save her.
You'll get awful mad, John. I done a Sin!
Are we goin' home, John?
Did you hear what I said, son?
Married! We have decided to go to Sistersville tomorrow, and when we come back --
-- and when we come back, we'll all be friends -- and share our fortunes together, John!
Now: Where?
About our secrets.
Why, pray tell?
She'll come draggin' her tail back home.
You're Miz Cooper, I take it.
What'd you all talk about?
Oh my god, oh my god...
Listen, I got a crazy favor to ask.
Me!? Why would anyone want to kill me?!
I've got a proposition for you. Listen very carefully, please.
Please. I'm gonna go get the guy who did it and bring him to you. I just need you be right there to arrest him. Okay?
Had to've done it. No one else was in there.
Take this, it'll help you sleep.
Oh lawyers got fat and the judge got famous, but someone forgot to sign the search warrant in the right place, and Fred Krueger was free, just like that.
And then what happened?
What you dream?
I'll tell you later.  That Gurganov, you never know whether he's on his way to the washroom or the Secret Police.
And you too, Ninotchka.
Ever since you have been back from Paris...
That's just it. It makes people feel queer. I dont' want you to get in any trouble.
You must help us, Leon... if you don't win her over we're on our way to Siberia!
Just a minute -- just a minute -- I have nothing against the idea but I still say let's go back to the Hotel Terminus. Moscow made our reservations there, we are on an official mission, and we have no right to change the orders of our superior.
You know what they say -- there's nothing like home.
Which lawyer?
All you have to do is say "open sesame."
A blue shirt, perhaps?
Is this satisfactory?
Halt negotiations immediately. Envoy extraordinary arrives Thursday six ten with full power. Your authority cancelled herewith. Razinin.
We don't want to be disturbed.
If you want to see us you must come later.
How much does this cost?
A week?
Do you know how much a cow costs, Comrade Iranoff?
A Special Envoy is coming from Moscow. He'll occupy the Royal Suite. Move our things to the smallest room you've got.
I am ashamed to put the picture of Lenin in a room like this.  Comrades, your telegram was received with great disfavor in Moscow.
I'm sorry, gentlemen. The other day I heard such a funny story...  It still makes me laugh. It is very funny.  I am sorry. Oh yes... about this injunction...
That's two weeks from Thursday...
I know, gentlemen, but it is in the hands of the Court. We're helpless, aren't we?
Four massive piers of masonry are sunk to a depth of forty-six feet on the side of the Seine, and twenty- nine and one-half feet on the other side. The girders of interlaced iron- work which stay the structure have an inclination of fifty-four degrees...
Glorious, analytical...
Oh, let it ring.
I don't look too foolish?
How do you do?
Would that make you any happier?
Trying to keep me away from you! It couldn't be done. Naturally I couldn't go on forever punching passport officials in the nose -- but I found a way, didn't I? Darling, I had to see you. I wrote and wrote but all my letters came back.
Leon! What in heaven's name...!
Is anything wrong? Are you ill?
Don't tell me the bed has lost its best friend.
Now, please, Swana.
That does it, Swana.  Now you mustn't miss your appointment with your hair-dresser.
Where are they?
Where are they?
You leave me no choice.
I will have to face the consequences, but so will you. Don't forget they will ask how you got them.
Where to, madame?
Well, there's Pruniers if you care for seafood. If you want to lunch in the Bois, there's...
At Pre Mathieu's.
It's just a place for workmen.
The bigger problem I see is this guy who was arrested, McCord -- James McCord -- he headed up security for the Committee to Re-Elect.  He turns out to be ex-CIA.
I was sorry to hear about your wife.
The President would like to know if that was the last payment.
Is it?
McCord? ...
The soldiers were provoked.  The students started it, for Christ's sake!
This is June twentieth?
Richardson won't do that.  He'll resign.
We feel the bigger concern is Gordon Liddy ...
Well, you know, sir, he's a nut.  He used to work here with the "Plumbers" and now he's running this Watergate caper.  You remember his plan to firebomb the Brookings using Cubans as firemen?  He wanted to buy a damned fire truck!  Magruder thinks he's just nutty enough to go off the reservation.
I suppose you thought the Presidency was above this sort of thing.
This isn't a "moral" issue, Bob.  We have to keep our enemies at bay or our whole program is gonna go down the tubes.  The FBI is filled with people who are pissed that I put Gray in and not one of their own.  Vietnam, China, the Soviet Union: when you look at the big picture, Bob, you'll see we're doing a hell of a lotta good in this world.  Let's not screw it up with some shit-ass, third-rate burglary.
No, no, not tonight.  Don't let her in here.  I have too much to do.
... he'd just found out about Track 2.
And his staff.  Come on, the copy they were filing from China was great.
... I was wondering what's such dynamite in this Bay of Pigs story?  ... although it was clearly effective, because all of a sudden it was no problem for Helms to go to the FBI and try to put a lid on Watergate.
I can't ...
Is there something else that's bothering you, Mr. President?
... little Bobby.
Yeah, well, as I said, Edgar ...
Like you said Jack, I'm just a New York lawyer now.
Mr. President, we are in a revolutionary situation.  We are under siege -- Black Panthers, Weathermen; The State Department under Rogers is leaking like a sieve.  And now this insignificant little shit Ellsberg publishing all the diplomatic secrets of this country will destroy our ability to conduct foreign policy.
You'll pick up the middle on this one - the Jews and Negros.
Do you miss Cuba, Manolo?
We let you down, didn't we.  Your people.
It was illegal, what he did.
... give me a break, Mary.
... but it depends on what I'm doing to the music, Dick ...
Yeah, she lives in Dallas ...
Bernstein.
Don't you want to listen to Brown's victory speech?
Amen to that.
I'll concede in the morning.
Yes ... you know it!  Yes ... I will. Yeah!
You're the strongest woman I ever met. I love you, Buddy.
Anything.
I'm the only left, Dick.  If you don't talk to me, you ...
Hey, you know Henry Kissinger -- he's down from Harvard.  On my staff, foreign policy whiz ...
No money in his room there?
I suppose. Though they was leavin' in a hurry.
Yes.
Signs and wonders. But I think once you stop hearin' sir and madam the rest is soon to follow.
Does that look to you like about a '77 Ford, Wendell?
I'd say it is. Not a doubt in my mind.
Yessir, his vehicle. Man killed Lamar's deputy, took his car, killed someone on the highway, swapped for his car, and now here it is and he's swapped again for god knows what.
...I believe they've done lit a shuck.
...Could I get you to call Loretta and tell her I've gone to Odessa? goin' to visit with Carla Jean Moss.
I'll call Loretta when I get there. I'd call now but she'll want me to come home and I just might.
...You got no cause to hurt me.
You gave your word?
That don't make sense. You gave your word to my husband to kill me?
Not like that. Not like you say.
What'm I supposed to tell Mama?
Llewelyn --
Where does he work?
Who is this.
Is somethin' wrong?
With anything?
...Don't put it in your pocket.
Don't put it in your pocket. It's your lucky quarter.
Yessir.
Okay.
Well enough.
What do you want to know?
...Don't worry. I'm not the man that's after you.
Sorry you had to see that. You were saying?
No... Friends from the diner maybe?
I questioned Joyce about all this...
Seems she was pretty familiar with 'ol Del. On a regular basis, if you get my drift...
Junior year!
So? ...Suppose Betty found out about them?
A woman can write a check.
Elden, let me out of here. Now! This is ridiculous, I need medical attention!
Do you know who I am?
Do you know why I'm here?
So all this... really was because of that soap opera? My son is dead because you came out here to be with that doctor? A fake doctor?
Wesley didn't even want to come up here. He warned me, but I insisted...  I have to ask you, Betty...are you crazy?
Tell Del I'm sorry. I left so quick, but I need to do this.
I gotta go.
I haven't been this happy since I was twelve years old.
For Mother's Day, I used all my allowance that I'd been saving to take my mother to Kansas City. We got our nails done and had lunch at "Skies," a restaurant at the top of a building from where you can see the whole city. It was the last outing we took together. She died the following year.
I just want everything to be perfect between us.
Of course.
Oh. Of course... sorry.
Right... I was. I was an idiot, plain and simple, and I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me. How's that?
I have... did it sound that bad?
George...
Thanks...
Hi, Betty. You're looking good...
Let me tell you something. I got groped by these Tunisian guys who thought I was a slut for wearing shorts, it was hotter than stink the whole time, and I got some kind of weird gum disease from the water. Plus, it ended my marriage --
No... I don't really know where he is yet. I'm at a hotel around the corner.
Either you're making a fool out of me because you get off on it, or you got serious problems. Which one is it?!
I'M TALKING ABOUT DAVID RAVELL!!
I spent my weekend looking for someone who does -- not -- exist. I should have been here at the hospital with my brother, but I was with you.
Are you sure I can borrow this?
Rosa...
You should have a little faith in people.
What part of Dixie are you from, Duane?
All right... lemme see... okay, new Burger King opens up. These assholes get excited and start lining up. Like it's some five star restaurant. The place is mobbed. Right?
I'm all for them owning casinos, getting rich off the white man's greed. It's a beautiful piece of irony, isn't it, Wesley?
So how do we know that car's still in Fair Oaks?
That woman could be in any one of four states. Four big states where the deer and the antelope play, Wesley! We're not in Rhode Island!
This doesn't look like the kind of place Betty would go to.
...and how long did she work here?
Hmm... you two in high school together?
But she wanted more out of life, right?
I see.  May I?
Thank you for your cooperation.  Just one more thing... did she ever talk about getting rich?
Betty, I thought this would be the best way. You know, throw you into it...
You're wastin' your time, Roy.
I see.  Did Chloe testify?
You got light fingers, Everett. Gopher?
...but try getting a decent hair jelly.
What on earth is goin' on here! What's got into you, Delmar!
Scuse me... scuse me... we're the next act...
You don't know where his goddamn folks from; you speakin' outcha asshole.
Where's your ring, honey?
Hell, now's the time to buy it off him cheap.
Aw, honey, our ring is just a old pewter thing -
It's just a symbol, honey -
How's this a plan? How're we gonna get a car?
Itta Bena, now, uh, that would be...
Well, it's a invitation-only affair; we'll have to sneak in through the service entrance-
...Yeah?
This is it. This is where I live. I suppose you could bunk over there and you could go to school at the base.
I'm not finished. I'll only be in port one week a month and when I'm here you'd never catch me playing daddy with you 'cause it's not who I am. Like I told you on the phone, you I'd be better off in that state school back in Virginia.
You got to kid. Let me spell it out for you. This is a whorehouse. And I happen to like my life the way it is and nobody's gonna make me change.
That's not how she told it. She said you wrote her every week you were away.
She said you told her in every letter how much you loved her, how you wanted to marry her, have children with her...
I found them, pard, and read them myself, right after she did it!
Are you laughing at me, dick-brain?
I thought the D.I.'s were supposed to help you in this place! What kind of human being are you?
Now when I say "understand" I want the whole group to say, "Yes, sir!" Understand?
Louder!
You're sure it's okay?
Far fucking out! I've been wanting to meet one of the Blue Angels since I can remember.
Paula, look at the new Poopies.
See you in a month when you get liberty!
God! I've never seen anything like that in my whole life! Did you see that guy's nose?
You want me to fuck you? Is that it? Okay, come here. Take your clothes off. Get into bed.
I don't care what the magazines say... it's just not as easy being a girl, especially from a Catholic family. You don't know the junk I grew up listening to, 'bout the way women are supposed to think and act.
Your real father was an Officer candidate like me?
Hey, do you guys ever... feel like you don't belong here...?
You okay?
So what's the problem? Girls do that all the time.
Not if she won't even talk about an abortion.
Do you know that for sure?
What the fuck is funny about this?
There is not one thing funny here.
The hell does she want?
WHO THE FUCK BREAKS IN THROUGH THE NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE?!
It's still a good plan.  It's just... got a twist.
Not if we keep 'em here.  You can't kidnap somebody in their own house. It's just breaking and entering, unless we take 'em someplace.  Or something like that, I'm pretty sure.
We're not leaving.  I'm getting in that room, and I'm opening that safe.
Third floor, spare bedroom, den, what have you.  Mr. Pearlstine used it as an office.
Push that button for me, will you?
Old Bernie didn't miss a trick with this room, did he?
We're not coming out.  We're not letting you in.  Get out of my house. 
Fuck.
Do it.
Alma!? I uhh I don't think...
Uhh... I with it sister but...
Free? We're back where we started. Shit we still don't have a stop light.
Sit down, This concerns you too.  I don't need to say that your department's handling of the Black Panthers -- particularly Inspector Brimmer's "undercover operation" has been a complete travesty.
God damn... Kid never had a chance...
Man, did you see Huey down on Grove street? All up on that cop, that was beautiful.
You got it. Berkeley?
To be quite honest it turns my stomach.
Shit, nothing but Paper Panthers.
You were. infantry right?
Man, this shit's pretty thick.
Huh?
You supposed to be a wounded vet, Motherfucka. What you do in 'Nam anyway, shoot gooks or shoot hoops?
I'm sorry we didn't give you more warning.
Personally, I'd prefer stupidity.
How did this... how did I let this happen?
I should have known... once I would have... I used to be wary... and today I watched my son killed before my eyes... your sister civilized me and I damn myself for having let her...
Thank you.
Apology accepted.  Now, on the matter of the specific targeting of officers during engagements, this is absolutely unacceptable.
Certainly you must know that in civilized warfare, officers in the field must not be accorded inappropriate levels of hostile attention.
Colonel, imagine the utter chaos that would result from un-led armies having at each other.  There must be gentlemen in command to lead and, when appropriate, restrain their men.
That is a separate issue.
I beg to differ.  One is a command decision on your part.  The other represents nothing more than the occasional over-exuberance of field officers attempting to carry out their duty in difficult circumstances.
The New York and Rhode Island assemblies have been dissolved...
Rioting both sides of the bay, in Chestertown they burned the Customs House and tar-and-feathered the Customs Agent.  He died of burns. In Wilmington they killed a Royal Magistrate and two Redcoats.
Alright, Corporal, you take Bennington, Harrisville, Acworth and the farms along Black Swamp.  I'll take the north side of the river. We'll meet at Snow's Island.
She said... she loves you and misses you but she understands why you can't be there with her.
He wanted to, Susan, but he couldn't leave his men.
One of yours?
I recognize him now.  Is he as imprudent as his father was at his age?
I'll see to it that he serves under me.
Don't worry.
If Cornwallis receives news that Clinton is coming, he'll simply hold tight and wait.  He'll fight a purely defensive battle and he'll win that.
Best never to go climbing on old blowdowns like this, Ellie--sometimes they bite.
Paxcow says Daddy's going to do something really bad. He--
In the end he's gonna croak, isn't he?
But don't you dare say that.
I don't know, honey. Different people believe all sorts of different things happen to us when we die. Some believe in heaven or hell. Some think we're born again as little children--
Well, it's actually reincarnation, but you get the idea. And some people think we just wink out...like a candle flame when the wind blows hard.
No--but if he drops by, I'll tell him to call you.
I can hardly read these.
What say, Louis?
Doesn't look like they last long.
Jud, why am I doing all this?
Out of the mouths of babes, Louis.
I'll tell you where the ground is sour--the ground in my heart is sour. Let me tell you something else, Vic-baby: Wrong is wrong.
Don't be silly. Church is not going to die.
You stole my boat.
Allow me the humor of listening to your terms.
The Pearl?  Oh, that's fine.  And just how do you expect this to work?
Why don't I want to do this?
No reason to fret.  It's just a prick of the finger and a few drops of blood.
Do you not know what this is, then?
No.  The pirates have taken Will --
Elizabeth, this is hardly appropriate --
You?!
You're in league with Barbossa!
When I get the Black Pearl back, I'm going to teach it to the whole crew, and we'll sing it all the time!
Kid's a bit of a stick, isn't he?
Raise the sails.
None?  Very well.  You rumbled me. I confess: I intend to commandeer one of these ships, pick up a crew in Tortuga, and go on the account, do a little honest pirating.
Who makes all these?
This is either crazy, or brilliant.
What's that?
On what?
What's your business in Port Royal, 'Mr. Smith'?
Look, I don't mean to rain on everyone's ascension here, but we got a little problem.
Pollution?
As you can see I am a new man, just like you.
A containment crew is going to attract a lot of attention.
I was wondering if you'd finished considering?
Dr. Makeo is working on it now, sir. I estimate at least another six hours.
Yeah, somebody broke in and stole the samples, one of those animal rights groups, right?  I remember now, they freed all the monkeys which caused that huge pileup on the Massachusetts Turnpike, right?
What's it smell like?
Like Crazy Glue?
Nothing really worthwhile.
Oh no, no, no!  You've got to be able to fix me!  Please, Susan, tell me you can make me normal again!
So right now there's little replicators spreading throughout Argon's lab?
I want you to know that I really appreciate you helping me.
Did you go?
Daniel, just forget Argon.  Let's get out of here.  We'll find another way to stop the waste.
That's impossible.
If this nutcase did take it and has half a brain, he'd use it right away, before we could invalidate it.
In fact, would it be safe to say, based on your general knowledge of this character, that he is already in the building?
You're not going to print this silly thing, are you?
Oh, I don't need another guess. It's quite obvious.
Now Mother, your attitude is perfectly ridiculous. It's done now. Stewart and I are married.
Oh, yes you will my dear - oh, yes you will my dear - you'll eat spinach but you'll wear garters too!
Anne, come here. Listen
I'll tell you what. Let's you and me sneak out all by ourselves
Think of the fun we can have - we'll sneak down the back stairs and get in the valet's Ford. How's that?
I'll tell you what let's do - I'll take you and introduce you to all my gang. Would you like that?
I don't mean the newspaper fellows that you don't like. Another gang I know - you'd love them. They're writers and musicians and artists - a great crowd of people - people who do great things. People who are worthwhile.
Oh, they're all right, Anne. But I
Good morning, Mother. Didn't I tell you that he'd be marvelous. Everybody thought he was so charming last night.
Oh, the usual thing. Blah, blah, blah attended the blah, blah reception and wore the same blah, blah things.
You don't have anything to complain about, Mother. He was all right last night, wasn't he? I told you not to worry about him.
Yeah!
Oh, that's all right with me. I won't hold it against you. But you see, I'm here to find out about
Well, Stew, that's all thrashed out. By golly, I'm surely glad to see that you're not really sore. You know our racket - after all, news is news.
I gave you the breaks, didn't I? That hairy chest story!
Just a boid in a gilded cage -
You heard me. A bird in a gilded cage.
And live on your salary, I suppose?
What play?
The one about the Siberian bloodhound?
Araby?
I think I understand, sir. You mean you want me to go?
Sure, sure. You've got a nose, Gallagher. You've got a nose. But there's different women, Gallagher. You know, like brewery horses and thoroughbreds.
Gallagher! She's the real McCoy!
There you go, talking like a woman!
Gee Gallagher, do you look good! What are you doing to yourself?
What did you do to that hair? And where did you get that dress?
Did who?
What do you know about Conrad?
A statement? Good.
Fine, but kinda thirsty.
Okay - you remember Joe
I sort of invited him along to bend an elbow. You don't mind, do you?
As a matter of fact, I was just trying to decide the color of Anne's eyes. I can't tell whether they're blue, or whether they're violet. What would you say, Mrs. Schuyler?
But I
I just love you in that sweater Mary-Sue. It's so flattering.
Why no. She's still on her date with Biff ... is something the matter?
Oh, hello Betty.
You can't go out there.
I made a couple of lunches for you and put them in brown paper bags ...  I'm gonna go now.
Mary Sue--C'mon ...
It's six-thirty ...
I'm sure you've noticed the same things we all have--certain "changes" going on in the town.  You know what I mean by "changes"?
"Changes."  And it's not just the fire or big stuff like that. It's little things.  Did you hear about Bill Miller?
Wife wants him to get one of those new beds.
Do you further admit that this was done surreptitiously and under the cover of darkness?
Good. Do you further admit that this unnatural depiction occurred in full public view where it was accessible to, and in plain sight of, minor children?
"It was big 'n brown 'n kept goin' an' goin' as far you could see."
What did you do?
JENNIFER!
Um ... They like wanna ask you a question ... I didn't know how to handle it. So ...
That was sure swell ...
I baked you my oatmeal cookies.
No. I baked them for you.
I picked them myself. They grow wild up here.  Mmm. So sweet.
You're unbelievable. You'll win this thing for sure. When is it on?
A thousand dollars ... And it's on all night?
Don't get upset.
Where are you going ...
WAIT A MINUTE!!
Okay, let's cut the shit and get right to it. Where's that remote control?
Because you're coming home.
Do you have the lettuce?
Have you cooked the burgers?
It's an art book.
Told you it was your lucky day. Bet you thought I was just a fan or something.
It's extension 215 if you want to try me back.
Yeah I can't.
Hello?
No. No. We got disconnect -- why?.....you're calling me at work....how did you get this number -- ?
This makes me very uncomfortable.
Should I just ask your girlfriend?  Maybe I should call back and talk to your girlfriend?
-- you said you did.
You lied to me?
Why did you tell me you did, then?
What do you do with all this pudding?
Is everything ok?
What happened?
What did he want?
Oh my god, you are so adorable. I just....god dammit.
I just...your face is so adorable and your cheek and your skin, I wanna bite it....I wanna bite your cheek and chew on it....god damn cute....fuck....
...what...?
Can I pay you here? Can I pay you for our drinks and salad?
How you doin' Barry?
How's business?
Good morning, Barry....
You made a phone call and you said you'd help a girl out and then you didn't....I'm here to get the money.
No, no, no, no c'mon man, don't make it a thing --
This is this place called Ace Vintage, you gotta find it, I don't know exactly where this is and I don't understand these maps so just go there and check it out. It's a '61 AC Cobra that this old guy says is fine, but I need to figure out why he's only asking 23 for it. So take a look, the whole thing, call me about that, if it seems alright then I'll head down there and check it out.
That's it.
So I'll meet you at the restaraunt?
Yes, well, I awoke to discover I'd turned into a cat. If you don't do as I say, I'll sink my little fangs into your drumsticks, and suck the marrow straight out of your bones.
In part, yes.
Care for a splash of wine, Abbe?
Start with the Bible; it's cheerier, and more artfully written.
It's a potent aphrodisiac, isn't it? Power over another man.
He's made a great success of our Little Theater; there's seldom an empty seat. Not to mention its therapeutic value.
Madame Bougival; Mademoiselle Clairwil -- and of course -- the Marquis' wife --
I've stared into the face of evil...  ...and I've lived to tell the tale. Now... for your own sake... let me write it down.
My darling, Eugenie, dainty morsel! Get on your back! Let's try it dorsal!
The unhappy tale of a virginal laundry lass, the darling of the lower wards, where they entomb the criminally insane.
Most assuredly.
It needn't be; not if you've another story.
Don't toy with me, Doctor.
Everywhere I go, they point and whisper! At the opera, they hiss at me when I take my box. When I went to church... the priest refused to even hear my confession; he said I was already damned! Why must I suffer for your sins?
It's not so bad here. After all, what girl doesn't want to live in a castle?
Yeah, Orson's a real piece of work. But deep down, he's a good kid. Real deep down.
And maybe we could get Mr. Warner and Mr. Goldwyn and Mr. Cohn and Mr. Selznick to play as well.
Oh, why is that?
Well -- he got us, didn't he? She stands and goes quickly to pour a drink. A forced laugh
Marion--
This picture--
"Well, if you got drunk to talk to me about Miss Alexander, don't bother. I'm not interested. I've set back the sacred cause of reform, is that it? All right, if that's the way they want it, the people have made their choice. It's obvious the people prefer Jim Gettys to me."
I don't know what you expected with Joseph- fucking-Conrad for Chrissake. I mean this is Hollywood, pal.
But you keep coming up with the same elitist crap - - HEART OF DARKNESS with a million dollar budget?! - - no one wants to see that.
Mank! You scoundrel! What took you so long?!
The key -- the key -- the clue -- what does this man recall on his death bed? Okay, Mank, you're dying. What's the last image that comes to you? Right now.
Why her?
Hey, kid. Gregg.
He truly doesn't care if he ever works again.
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud."
Do you every think for one second that you might have some responsibility for what you're doing?! For cutting and slashing everything in your way so you can have your goddamn movie?!
Oh, no--
He's Christ?
You want to do the life of Jesus?
J.R., glad you could make it.
I'm tellin' you, she'll be there, I know she'll be there.
How you gonna catch anybody alone at a dance?... I don't know if she'll be there alone... She'll probably be there with her girlfriends or something.
Nah, she don't go with nobody. She's only 15 years old.
Probably. You know she talks to everybody, and not just him.
Ah, some piece of ass, I'm tellin' you.
Huh?
With her? How?
Ah, no, no. I didn't bang her. I know her from around here, that's all. You want to meet her or what?
Whatcha doin'?
Maybe she's afraid you're gonna hit her so she can't talk to you the way she wants to.
Try talkin' to her. She's your wife -- ask her what's the matter.
Jack, if there was anything funny, I would tell you.
Sure, I'll keep an eye on her.
I got good news, and I got bad news. The good news is you got your shot at the title. The bad news is...
Was Vickie part of the deal with Tommy? Was my wife part of the deal? Tell me, was that it?
You don't talk very much.
I ain't no movie star. I'm just in high school.
I like the gym smell.
Jake, no --
Open the door, Vickie.
Aw, c'mon. Don't say that.
Aw, c'mon, Vick --
I can't convince him. He's got such a thick head, I'd like to crack it open myself. Believe me, my own brother. It's very hard. You don't have to convince me -- I know we should be with Tommy. You talk to him. He don't listen to nobody.
Of course, it's normal for a man to tie his trunk up with a heavy rope.
Who said they left then?
Oh -- that phone call!  I gave them your number -- hope you don't mind.
Well -- did you get it, Thorwald?
I'll give you a chance to find out. Meet me in the bar at the Brevoort -- and do it right away.
For a little business meeting -- to settle the estate of your late wife.
Now stop wasting time, Thorwald, or I'll hang up and call the police.
You're never going to marry?
A Federal offense.
I wonder.
Miss Lonely Hearts just laid out something that looks like sodium trieckonal capsules.
I handled enough of those red pills to put everybody in New Jersey asleep for the winter.
No -- but it makes the rest easy to take. And she's reading the Bible.
Hello.
Yes.
Not yet, Jeff.
I couldn't think of anything more boring and tiresome than what you've been through. And the last week must be the hardest.
Lisa, simmer down -- will you?
What do you think?
All day long I've tried to keep my mind on work.
And you, and you friend Doyle --  Did you hear from him again -- since he left?
From his landlord -- once a month.
You are. You have a talent for creating difficult situations.
Well?
What's that?
Friend of yours?
Nobody chickened.
Where can we meet?
Mother--
I don't think so--
You sure?
Is he there?
I think his first name's Ray--I have to see him.  It's very important.
How'd you get here?
Boy, I bet you'd go to a hanging.
How do you know so much about this junk, Plato?
Can I keep it?
What happened, darling.  We were so worried.  I was going to take a sleeping pill, but I wouldn't till I knew you were home.
Too bad you didn't connect.  You could have gone to Juvenile Hall. That's what you want, isn't it?
Sure it is.  You want to bug us till we have to lock you up.  Why?
No.
Go on--don't give me that.  Someone giving you hard looks?
Hi.  I saw you before.
You don't have to be unfriendly.
See?
"Life can be beautiful." Hey, I know where it was.
Where I saw you.  Everything going okay now?  You live around here?
See, I'm new.
You can trust me, Judy.
No!
What makes you think he hates you, Judy?
So. This is the guy you been waiting for. Man of your dreams.
Must have a way with stationery.
All those letters are about to pay off, baby... all those letters...
Searching for a money man...
-- till he fucked his parole --
Do that again.
Well, I don't know about that --
Security, Ash, I just worked security. They wouldn't be rolling out the red carpet --
We'll have more fun in Detroit.
He'll kill you.
My brother's killed people, I know he has. Truckers. If you talk him into thinking you're not you, you'll only get yourself dead.
Nick, please, it's me --
No, Nick, no --
So does it look a lot different?
He wants to see your map.
He says he wants it now.
You... you don't know me --
No, you can't --
How much money's in that casino? Day-to-day.
The hell you don't.
You wrote Ash that letter, you told her that story 'bout working Christmas Eve, bout how they'd send half the security guys home, nobody comin, in that night. And the rest of you got shit-faced drinking hot buttered rum. That a true story now?
A cowboy. You're going to send me into an Indian casino disguised as a cowboy. Have you thought this entirely through?
It's time for me... to be working for me. I want mine, Nick. And I need you.  Did you tell your manager there's gonna be a robbery?
You are lucky, convict. You're spending Christmas with the birthday boy himself --
THE POWWOW SAFE! WHERE IS THE POWWOW SAFE!
The Powwow Safe where you steal your money! Where you cheat your Indians!
That motherfucker --
What you gotta worry about first is the guards. Place doesn't look much richer than when I worked there, so let's figure you're gonna have to deal with ten of 'em. There'll be two on the floor, walking the room, that leaves eight up above. Eyes in the sky. They see something up, they're the ones who'll hit the silent alarm and you're fucked.
You gotta get someone upstairs.
Why you gotta say a thing like that.
Why you gotta. We were gonna give you a ride someplace, man. Now I just don't know.
GUARD! GUARD!
Watch your mouth, man. It's Christmas.
I don't wanna lift crates.
We can work this out, can't we?
He's right about the ear, it's hacked off.
Myself and Mr. Pink?
Wong?
I'll take care of this, you guys leave the tip.  And when I come back, I want my book back.
I know.
Your name's Freddy something.
Frankie Ferchetti introduced us once, about five months ago.
Hey, just cancel that shit right now! You're hurt. You're hurt really fucking bad, but you ain't dying.
Oh excuse me, I didn't realize you had a degree in medicine. Are you a doctor? Are you a doctor? Answer me please, are you a doctor?
I'd go over twelve percent for that.
So, is he dead or what?
So what is it?
I told ya he'd be pissed.
Tell them to come on in.
It doesn't matter who they are.
And this is Helen Carter.
But the nearest shelter's the Wyatt ranch and that's maybe five hours away.
Don't you trust me?
Go on, take it. Then you can't spend the rest of the trip expecting to get paid.
That job you were talkin' about, did you get it yet?
Because... well, you said you wanted a man to think enough of you to walk in the place you were working and take you out of there... tonight I was sort of tied up with Steve... but tomorrow I figured on doing just that.
You might tell a fellow things, 'specially if the fellow's your brother, seems to me.
There was only three of them at first. I guess I lost my head.
They were quite a ways off and the wind was blowin'. I didn't have them to aim.
Go on, hit me.
You oughta say you're sorry -- that's what you oughta do.
I'm sorry about this, Mr. Wyatt. I didn't know who she was.
I can't take her with me.
You got no business snoopin' around --
When I ask questions, I like to hear answers.
How long do you think we'll have to stay here?
We don't want to go there.
Clay could save us an awful lot of time.
You said somebody was comin' back -- who's comin' back?
Is that your kind of reading, Steve?
-- and even if I do learn to read, what use'll it be? I'm goin' to live on a ranch!
You stretch out. I'll fix something to eat.
Oh, remember that time I got my training bra and you --
This house was built in 1898 by a man named Archibald Keaton as a gift to his wife, Cora.
No, they sold the house in 1920 to a millionaire, Uriah Bloodworth.
No, he lost the house after the stock market crash.
Hi Buddy.
We should act out our inner most fantasies.
Like, I've always wanted to walk on the moon.
Hey, look out, a bee!
Come in somebody. Can you hear me?
The ghost is close. He almost got us. Buddy is hurt.
Stop! --
I'm sorry.
Professor, is this the same house that a young girl was possessed by a demon or something?
I don't like this, this...
Are those cameras all throughout the house?
Hello Dwight.
You never could feel your legs.
Oh shit, you gonna take that?
Yo' Tommy, what up, man?
Aww, man. You just need to chill out. Come on, there's this party tonight it's gonna be fun. Lot's of alcohol and honeys.
I wouldn't give ya a nickel.
Well, your mother's going to PTA today.  We'll see what your teacher has to say. 
Bye, Birdie.  Chip, honey... I know it's hard being a teenager but I understand... I'm your mother and I love you.
What is it, officers? My patient is waiting.
Sorry, son.  This is a matter for adults.
No woman would!
Beverly! Not the Sterners!
FUCK YOU TOO, YOU ROTTEN WHORE!!
Who is this?
Did you see her?! She just said "Fuck you" to me!
It's him!
That was your People magazine with the letters cut out, wasn't it?
And those were your scissors found sticking out of Mrs. Sterner's stomach, weren't they?
Mrs. Ackerman, do you recycle?
What is it, Betty?
The acceptance of a secret is an obligation and in this case my dear, the obligation carried with it the necessity of dying if one betrayed that secret. You understand that don't you?
Then, you also understand that you must die.
I haven't got that much in cash.
About forty-five dollars.
Some of us, Frances, must believe without understanding.
 What have you done about Irving August?
You've never believed a word I told you about Mr. August.
Greg, it isn't a wild tale. It's true. If there were only some way --
I'm going to find your sister.
But I'm not joking.
But I'm better than a detective. I have an understanding of people - and a love of them -- an understanding of the city - -
But I understand her. That may be more important.
I'm tired of being afraid - of waiting.
I'm not going to wait. I'm going out -- laugh, dance --do all the things I used to do.
I don't know.
I want you to see my room. I want you to see all of it.
Jason, my pet 
Following me to find Jacqueline?
Well, it won't work. Love and understanding won't make a good detective out of a recalcitrant poet.
What?
Is it about Jacqueline?
I can almost feel your doubt about what I'm saying, Mary.
I have no intention whatsoever of hinting. Your sister, Mary, is a murderess. She killed Irving August -- stabbed him out of fright when he discovered where she was hiding.
Miss Gibson, I'm tired of resting.
You have only to stretch out your hand, take up the glass and drink a little.
This food is excellent.
So what about kids?
Do you want them?
Why is that?
What... what are these interviews about?
About sex?
What about sex?
Like what?
You just ask them questions?
And they just answer them?
To you?
I don't... why... why do you do this?
This is just... so...
Is he going to see this?
If you were in love with me, would you?
But if you were?
But I feel like maybe I could be really comfortable with you.
So why won't you make love with me? Why wouldn't you, I mean?
Oh, we get along okay. She's just very... she's an extrovert. I think she's loud. She probably wouldn't agree. Definitely wouldn't agree.
Goddammit, goddammit!! That son of a bitch!!  Well, at least I know you didn't fuck him.
When did you begin having this feeling?
Prior to this feeling, were you comfortable having physical contact with him?
Besides, even if I decided to fuck his brains out, what business is that of yours?
What?
I say it because it's descriptive.
Ann, you always underestimate me.
I think you're afraid to put the two of us in the same room together. I think you're afraid he'll be undeniably drawn to me.
"My type"? What is this bullshit? How would you know what "my type" is?
Ann, you don't have a clue. Look, I don't even know why we're discussing this, I'll just call him myself.
Well, I'll call him when he does.
What are you talking about?
Oh, please. Okay, so give me the Zen master's address, I'll think of a reason to stop by.
Why? Just give me the address, you won't even have to be involved.
And what?
Thank you.
I am now recording. Tell me your name.
Describe for me your first sexual experience.
Your first sexual experience.
Was it ever a topic of conversation between the two of you afterward?
How unfortunate. So when did you finally get to see a penis?
Live, or in a photograph or film of some sort?
What did you think? Did it look like you expected?
Were you disappointed?
What about when you touched it? What did you expect it to feel like, and then what did it really feel like?
What did he say?
Then what happened?
I wish I could tell everybody that Ann's a lousy lay. Beautiful, popular, Ann Bishop Millaney.
Well, maybe I could just start a rumor, then.
Afraid of getting caught?
You should be. Can I meet this friend of yours?
I'm intrigued.
Come on, John. You should be happy, we've gone this far without Ann finding out, I'm making it real easy on you. Just walk out of here and I'll see you at your house for a family dinner sometime.
Who?
No, he didn't put me up to this. Jesus, I don't need people to tell me what I should do. I've just been thinking about things, that's all.
If he had been under your prick you'd have spotted him for sure.
I know. Will you please leave now?
John, we have nothing to talk about.
Your keys, asshole!! Your two fucking keys!! Give them to me!!
Jesus!
Anything wrong?
Well? Supper at my place?
Where is this thing that attacked your wife?
Rog, I gotta talk serious to you. Really. Listen. Ya listening? OK. I want you to come into this with me. To tell the honest-to-God truth, I'm lonely.  All Hobbes ever did was run around getting money and phone me in the middle of the night. He wanted you in anyway. That's why we were gonna get together, the three of us. We would have enough to keep us going for at least five years, even with inflation.
You want to help sick people for the rest of your life? God forbid I should talk you out of it.
It was women did it to Hobbes. Couldn't handle them. That girl, that Annabelle -- talk about crazy projects.
You bet, Bert.
I know, I know, it's just...
In my time they used to call me the Merlin of Berlin.
Conspiracy?  That sounds a little farfetched.
Sounds like my husband.  He never came back either.  At least not after Flavors gave him a commercial break.
Oh.  Ah, I'm not calling at an inconvenient moment am I?
YOU'LL FIND A RAMBLING ROSE AND A PICKET FENCE
Brad!  Oh, Brad.
Just one or two details.  Does he have any living relatives? Blood relatives?
Ah.  Mr. And Mrs. Majors.  How wonderful to see you.  I am Dr. Cosmo McKinley and this is my sister, and colleague, Nation McKinley.
THAT MINIMAL
You don't think I fuck you, bitch? I'll fuck you.
Are you there? Miles?
I'm sorry, Miles. We did all we could. You've been a real trooper.  Tell him I'll call back.
She was good for you.  And so beautiful and intelligent. You knew her, right?
Hiya.
Did you read the latest draft, by the way?
And?
How about the new ending? Did you like that?
There is no new ending. Page 750 on is exactly the same.
So what'd you guys finally decide on for the menu?
Yeah, but how are they making the salmon? Poached with a yogurt-dill sauce? Teriyaki? Curry?
Oh, Jesus. Look, at some point we have to find out because it's going to make a big difference.
Doesn't have to be now. Let's go taste.
Hey Jack, hurry up!
So what're we going to have? Pigs in a blanket? The "rancher's special breakfast"? Or maybe just some grease and fat with a side of lard?
So what should I wear?
Oh, boy.
Call me on my cell if you go out.
Just don't give up on Maya. Cool smart chicks like that --they like persistence.
How about this one? We didn't hit this one.
You ever actually been in there, Miles?
Fucking chick's married.
Her husband works a night shift or something, and he comes home, and I'm on the floor with my cock in his wife's ass.
Ran. Twisted my ankle too.
What the fuck!
What the fuck!
Well, good to see you, Miles. Jack.
Is this Stephanie's kid? Sure is cute.
Is she sleeping or...?
No, we've got to get back Friday for the rehearsal dinner.
Hello?
I just wanted you to know I've decided not to go to the wedding, so in case you were dreading some uncomfortable, you know, run-in or something, well, worry no more. You won't see me there. My wedding gift to you and what's- his-name. What is his name?
Ken.
Well, I'm not coming, Barbie. So you guys have fun.
What's everyone ordering? Then we can sort out the wine.
It was a surprise, Mom.
See this is why we're not watching those news reports. People get obsessed.  I'm letting go now.
I was just taking a walk before dinner.
It was very dark.
For the kids protection. All they were doing was watching TV from five a.m. I felt like they were getting obsessed like you said. They should be playing furry, furry rabbit or tea party or something right?
That's a game isn't it?  Anyway...  There's been some interesting developments.
We won't be able to get out of there.
That's good enough for me.
It says they're probably very small -- like my height -- because, as their brains developed, there was no use for physical development. It says they're probably vegetarians, because they would have realized the benefits of such a diet.
They'll read our minds!
Is anything missing?
Some guy had a sign that said it was the end of the world.  Nothing really bad is going to happen, is it Uncle Merrill?
Jake, I'm going to ask you once -- was it self-defense?
...Gotta go...
The Parkers seem like nice folks.
Paden sends his best.
I'm just meeting a guy here and moving on. So far I haven't been able to find him.
Doesn't look quite fair.
You might make a farmer yet.
You mean you ain't coming with Emmett and me?
Sure we are. We're leaving at dawn.
Yeah, that's what happened with me too.
There are three strangers in this room, traveller, and these gents you are accusing aren't them.  Are these your friends?
Came to the wrong town. I don't tolerate this kind of thing. It's hard on the peace, and it's hard on the furniture. Now, knowing a bit about Carter here, I'm going to let you go without paying for the damages. But go you will, and I mean now.
You misunderstand. I want you out of town. In fact, I want you all the way out of my jurisdiction.
This is it, gents. My ma told me to head south past that rock.
You got a place to stay?
You work here?
What is it that I can't figure?
Can you tell us why you were disposing of the body of a woman who didn't exist?
Why don't you just come clean, Viktor?  Tell the truth.  You'll feel better afterwards.
We all know what happened.  In a fit of jealous rage you killed Simone and dumped her body off a boat she bought for you.
I'm not taking away your daughter, just your deal.  You and I both know, after the divorce I kept you on for old time's sake, so you could still hold your head up in front of Lainey.  I called what's his name at Warner's.  He said he'd take a meeting -- in July.  I've fought for you Viktor...  You want to talk severance?
The picture's dead.
They're yours.  But how are you going to finish it?  Without a star there's no movie.
Maybe you're right.  Twelve years after your daughter's born you decide to become a father.
I should fire you more often.  The film's looking wonderful.
Yes.  To be honest I never quite saw this film before -- maybe it's the way Simone is playing it -- but what it's saying about the illusion of permanence in everyday life, how that's the only way we can love -- I think it's really going to mean something.
I'd love to tell her myself.  When are you going to let me meet her?
Everyone I know has met her, Viktor.
My two favorite girls.
Don't look so glum, Viktor.  It's not a death sentence.
You understand you'll have to come back to my place to keep them off the, er...  ... scent.
You look so, so...
Yes, of course, but very beautiful in your own right.
Viktor, I'm so happy for us!
The film.  The chemistry.  No reflections on Nicola but Simone and I -- we were just so right together.
And still the connection was undeniable.  I haven't read "Eternity Forever" but I know it's brilliant.  And I know I would be perfect for Clive.
Yes, perfect.  As a matter of fact, I ran into Simone on the lot the other day.
You already do.  But my actor won't get old, fat, lazy or drunk -- won't throw tantrums, demand a body double, script changes or a bigger trailer.  The Disney Corporation has been using artificial actors for years.
It can -- with my new computer code, you and me, we can do it together.
That's why you're so perfect.  You have something I don't have.
An eye -- for performance.  You know the truth when you see it.  I know.  I've seen your movies.  I love your movies.
"Straw God" changed my life.
I've seen every frame of your work. You're the only filmmaker in Hollywood with the artistic integrity to realize my vision. You and me, art and science... we are the perfect marriage.
I won't be here next week.  The tumor's inoperable.  I'll be dead.
Okay, Dad.
-- I know, I don't know anything.
About you and mom?
Alright, Sayer, you've got a deal.
Mr. Sayer...
Mr. Sayer, did we pay the million bucks yet?
Hi.
Speaking of which -- this is the project I'd like you to do next.
On my way to the flea market in Amish country. Thought maybe you want to come. Show me how to buy at these things.
And Cole, next time I won't be late for you.
Mr. Marschal gets real lonely.
Dead people, like in graves and coffins?
Don't cry.
You weren't a paper champion.
Don't go home, okay?
You know that accident up there?
Someone got hurt.
A lady. She died.
Yes, Cole?
...He doesn't get invited places.
The last time was a Chuck E. Cheese party a year ago. He hid in one of those purple plastic tunnels and didn't come out.
Okay, Farm Boy. Joke's over. You've been playin' me from jump street. Where's my Nikes?
Suzie???
You know, one day I'm going to have to shut down that still of yours, Jeremiah.
The ancient Aztecs knew how powerful this stuff was.
We've got to call someone -- get the sheriff--
You like it? Irrigation system. Your grandaddy built it himself. Saved the land from dying.
Sure. What do you want to know.
Hey. Could you be a little more insensitive? We're on our way to a funeral for Crissake.
Yeah. That's just the problem.
We're almost ready. What the hell are you doing out here?
The trap door. That's how he escaped the fire...
Carl.
What you up to?
Was always curious why you... married Grant in the first place... Just never seemed outta love.
He's gotta be in the forest. All three ranches run alongside it.
Looks like a chipmunk.
Where's the old half--Mexican?
I never danced in a towel before.
He took him over. His body. His -- his brain, everything what he knew. He's only been dumb stuff before amoeba--things, and rhino--things. He liked being human. Didn't want to change.
When one sees you they all see you.
I can't believe there's two thousand people here to watch a bunch of guys back up their trucks.
Well?...
No. I want to know what you think about besides ditching Smokey?
Is this fun?
Driving, talking to me...
You have a great profile.
Your honeymoon would've never been this exciting.
-- You know, I used to be a high fashion model. Tried it for six months and almost freaked. Makeup, silly clothes, a little man saying 'darling' every two seconds...
They should arrest people for obeying the speed limit.
See ya, Bandit.
Believe me, man; Fred'll be no problem.
You know how to drive one of these things?
Bandit?
-- How we doing?
Breaker, Breaker. This is Bandit I, coming up on a portable gas station. Do you copy?
Yeah, Bandit II, Que pasa?
It's gotta be tough keeping an eye on everything.
But the Bureau knew Sparazza killed Heller. Why not go after him, guns blazing' for that one?
This man wearing the jacket identified himself as an Federal agent?
You're sure?
And when you saw him later, he was wearing one of your security jackets --
I'm here, where's the car?
I said that we were returning his call and you were real concerned, because he sounded real concerned.
FUCK YOU!
It's the last place they'd look.
You realize that Sparraza has had thirty-six major medical procedures performed on him since 1953? Elective plastic surgery, every single one --
...Yeah, fifty-three.
Buzzy... Buzz...?
Right, you got clicks, anything?
You got the fifty up? Bitch y'tryin' t'take down a jumbo jet? Blown the moon out the sky? T'fuck you wanna get that grimy?
Bulllllshit...
Meaning Man can do whatever the fuck it wants?
That's fantastic.
Tell me.  I won't think you're insane.
They come when you sleep.
Don't.
I don't know.  I can't be alone.
But what if Solaris is what there was before The Big Bang?
I like that too.
Can you sleep?
Listen: I don't care about anything but the fact that you are here.  You are her, you are Rheya.
No.
Rheya, I am not going back.  I'm staying here with you.
We thought you'd be alone.  We want to talk about...
I've never seen anyone killed before.
You can touch me, I won't bite.
That's the dumbest walk I ever saw!
And die laughing, because you're walking so stupid!
Yeah.
They guys treatin' you all right?
I've been doing a lot of thinking.
I'll miss you, Mike.
Hey, can we go to McDonald's?
Hey.  The neighbors.
I'm sorry.  I know I heard noises... the detective's wife...
He doesn't want to sleep here.  Neither do I.  It's not my house anymore.
No One-Seventeen, they'll fuck it up!  He told me not to tell anybody, to bring Claire and come alone!  He won't wait, he knows I'm two minutes away!  Koontz, please!
You're here 'til what time?
Nice threads Dad.
Here you go, Pete.
What, want a glass?
Flash, get lost.
Now tell me you love me.
Oh, that?  It'll come unstuck in a half-hour or so. Your mouth needs the rest.  Bye.
I hate the Platonic idea of you.
I hate--
Don't misquote Othello at me. Besides, you'd have to care about somebody to strangle them.
Hold it.  Can we stop being clever, just for a moment?
Aunt May, you're trespassing.
Poison emergency.
Is this some sort of Zen thing?
Do ya? Lemme give you the number for Bellevue.  That's 561-5151--
A bit melodramatic but if you could prove it that would tie in your unified field theory, the Big Bang, Kaluza-Klein--
This photo you took of "Spider-Man" -
Really.  I'd like to speak with him.
You never know.  Go get some sleep.
I listened to him talk of eternal truth and thought of the Bhagavad Gita, the Indian holy book-- "I am become Shiva, Death-- the destroyer of worlds."  Octavius was...
Loonytunes.  And yet...
We made a deal with Barrack One.
I understand how you feel, Cookie. It's sort of rough -- one American squealing on other Americans. Then again, Cookie -- maybe that stoolie's not an American at all. Maybe he's a German the Krauts planted in this barracks. They do this type of thing. Just put an agent in with us -- a trained specialist. Lots of loose information floating around a prison camp. Not just whether somebody wants to escape, but what outfits we were with and where we were stationed, and how our radar operates. Could be, couldn't it?
Why not? Just one of the boys. Sharing our bunks. Eating our chow. Right in amongst the ones that beat me up. Except that he beat hardest.
That's not the point, Cookie. The point is what do you do with him? You tip your mitt and the Jerries pull him out of here and plant him someplace else, like Stalag Sixteen or Fifteen. Or you kill him off and the Krauts turn around and kill off the whole barracks. Every one of us. So what do you do?
I suppose they also know about your distillery and the horseraces?
Just what makes you and them Krauts so buddy-buddy?
Don't ask me. Price was elected Security.
Lieutenant Dunbar? It wouldn't be James Schuyler Dunbar? From Boston?
Here we have a typical barrack. It houses seventy-five men. Every one of them has his own bunk, naturally.
As for the blankets, you will notice they are very warm. Fifty percent wool.
Why don't we accept, Animal? The worst that can happen is we wind up a couple of lamp shades.
It's chow, Animal! Chow!
No you don't! You don't want any broads with boots on!
You want Betty Grable!
Look at her! Isn't she beautiful! Married an orchestra leader!
Not for me! Betty! Betty!
You'll fix me up!
How? Pinky Miller from Barrack 8 tried to get over there and they shot him in the leg!
You did?
I'll open mine now.
Look -- if you don't like the way I'm handling this job --
We've all done a poor job of it.
Lay off, Sefton.
What are we going to do with him?
So was the radio private property. So was Manfredi and Johnson.
Schulz, you're off your nut!
We have no radio.
Hey, Schulz -- as long as you're going to move somebody in -- how about a couple of those Russian broads?
You must have been some tail gunner!  Go ahead, Cookie.
Target their Bridge.
According to our current information, the destruction of the Amargosa star has had the following effects in this sector: gamma emissions have increased by .05 percent, the starship Bozeman was forced to make a course correction, a research project on Gorik IV was halted due to increased neutrino particles, ambient magnetic fields have decreased by-
Data, you're not thinking about using that thing are you?
Wait a minute. I thought you've always been afraid it would overload your neural net.
Looks like you're stuck with emotions for a while. How do you feel?
We all are, Data. But we're going to get him back.
That ribbon isn't just some random energy phenomenon travelling through space. It's a doorway. It leads to another place- the Nexus. It doesn't exist in our universe and it doesn't play by the same rules either.
Excuse me, gentlemen, if you'll take your seats.
Captain of the Enterprise, huh?
Close to retirement?
Keep her together until I get back.
There's still no indication of why they attacked the station?
Hmm,  Inform Starfleet Command. This could indicate a new Romulan threat in this sector.
Is there a problem?
Captain, Im sorry.  I know there were a lot of unresolved conflicts between you and your brother.
We're all mortal, Soran. It's one of the truths of ou existence.
The Nexus.
It is a Class D-12 Bird of Prey. They were retired from service because of defective plasma coils.
Shall I alert Dr. McCoy?
Aye sir, coding now.
Same sector. Metallic mass.
Negative, on surface... A manufactured object.
Saavik... My god, what happened to them?
You mean, we're stranded down here?!
How can you be logical at a time like this?! We have to get thee hell off this planet!
Why don't you just call for <u>help</u>!
Ah, Saavik, that's, ah, extroadinary. What would you, ah, like to do next?
Saavik... Does Dr. Marcus think there could be -- any chance of -- ah -- radioactive contamination?
Mr. Scott: two photon torpedoes at the ready. Sight on the center of the mass.
I know you... Do I not?
My father says you have been my friend... You came back for me.
Why would you do this...?
See! That shimmering area.
Standby automatic approach system ... Advise approach control.
I say again: Grissom, this is Enterprise. Admiral Kirk calling Captain Esteban or Lieutenant Saavik. Come in!
Sarek... I would have come to Vulcan... to express my deepest sympathies...
Then you know how bravely your son met his death.
I -- saw no future --
Yes, I was...
But -- why?
Sir. Your son meant more to me than you can know. I'd have given my life if it would have saved his. You must believe me when I tell you that he made no request of me!
Then, how --
Why haven't they finished us?... They outgun me ten to one; they have four hundred in crew to my handful, yet they sit there.
You amaze me, Commander.
A twenty year space veteran, yet you ask for the worst duty station in town. I mean, look at this place: the hind end of space.
Well, maybe that's okay for someone like you whose career is winding down. But me: I need some challenge in my life. Some adventure... Even just a surprise or two.
Slide them down your nose. Now look at me over the top. And you read printed matter through the bottom.
Say thank you.
Go? <u>Where</u> are we going?
<u>Will you please be quiet</u>!  Commander Chekov, this is completely irregular. Who gave the order you are quoting? Who gave the order?
But Genesis is a civilian project, under my control --
Will you please be quiet! We must have order here.  This has to be some sort of mistake.
I told you! I told you I saw a --
Where's Dr. Marcus --
Steady on course. All systems normal.
Tactical!
I don't know you. But you. I never forget a face. Mister Chekov, isn't it?  I never thought to see your face again.
Mr. Scott on discrete.
No, sir! You'll flood the whole compartment...!
I assume you are loitering here to learn what efficiency rating I plan to give your cadets.
Carol Marcus --
You've got to learn WHY things work on a Starship.  It's coming through now, Khan...
Spock!
That was a little joke.
Admiral?
Saavik, get us out, best speed!
Mr. Sulu... The shields!
We're over our heads. Mr. Sulu, get us out of here.
Take her out, Mr. Saavik.
Well, so much for the tour of our humble plant. I must say, Professor your knowledge of engineering is most impressive.
It doesn't look all that different.
Specifically, Humpback Whales.
What's causing that!?
Can you isolate the wave?
Shields, Mr. Chekov.
So you were at Berkeley.
They're gonna hafta take their chances.
Wanna try it from the top?
... Who are you?
Oh my God, we're too late!
Earth... But when?... Spock?
It's her -- from the Institute. If we play our cards right, we may learn when those whales are really leaving.
You got us to the right place, Spock. Now all we have to do is get the whales out before we <u>sink</u>.  Mr. Scott, come in!... Scotty...?!  Damn... Mr. Spock, see to the safety of all hands.
10 seconds, sir!
We'll stick together till we get orientated. Bearing to the whales?
Scotty, how long is this bay?
That should be enough. Can you enclose it to hold water?
Stand by, sir. Miracle worker at work...
Full power, sir.
Professor Scott, if you'll --
We were under the impression they were being held against their will.
There's one thing I don't understand.  In three hundred years...you never learned to swim?
Do you really think your mighty Federation would be interested in protecting six hundred people?
Can he breathe under water?
Won't he rust?
I believe the boy is... afraid... of me.
... I am the personification of everything they have rejected.
Take us into a high orbit.  Lie down, Admiral. The girls will take twenty years off your face...
Captain, I wasn't expecting you.
I wish I had better news. Commander Data attacked us in the mission scout ship yesterday. Ru'afo and I have decided to send in an assault team...
Gallatin! So the righteous Starfleet Captain finally released you. Did you encounter any problems on the surface?
I took these out of Data's neural net... they contain memory engrams...
By a Son'a weapon.  There's no doubt about it, sir. That's what made Data malfunction.
I don't believe it happened that way.
All I know is that he was functioning normally until he was shot. Then, his fail-safe system was activated...
His ethical and moral subroutines took over all of his basic functions...
In a sense, that's all he knew. The system is designed to protect him against anyone who might try to take advantage of his memory loss.
Sir, they've detonated an isolytic burst... a subspace tear is forming...
Who is it?
I wish there was a way to bring them back home.
Direct hit. He's resetting his shield harmonics...
The Ba'ku could use some rest, sir. According to the geo-scan, this may be the safest area for the next few kilometers...
Nomadic, collectors of precious metals, jewels...
Initiate launch sequence.
He's stable... for now.  But it would be better if we could contact... our friends.
Have you ever wondered what it's like to have flesh?
No... no, it's so... empty... please... give it back... I need it...
But now... they are all one with the Borg.
Captain, I'm starting to worry about the hull integrity. We've been running the support field at full power for three hours straight. I don't know how much longer it's going to hold up.
Ready to make a little history?
There's no temporal shielding in here! We're starting to pick up relativistic effects!
And what were you doing out at the missile silo?
Lucky for him you came by when you did. He might be dead now.
Maybe you can tell me what he's been doing in that silo. We heard some explosions out there this morning...
No... but sometimes I feel that way.  What I meant was, I'd be willing to trade for the photographs.
I'm an old friend... I met him when he was doing his undergraduate work at Cornell back in --
Life signs?
Incoming transmission from Starfleet Command. Admiral Hayes.
I have assigned two damage control teams to locate the source of our communication problems. So far, they've had no success.
Are you alright?
Try not to look at the stars... keep your eyes on the ship.
And Commander, whatever you do... do <U>not</U> vomit in your exo-suit. It would be... unpleasant.
Worf to Bridge.
I'd prefer not to be the President to push the button if I can avoid it.
What the Hell's going on?
Jim, leave me - I'm finished...
Too bad we can't SMELL her.
It takes a lot of effort.
Are those your words?
Spoken by you?
Louder, please. We cannot hear you.
From Starfleet?
Mr. Spock, Rura Penthe's deep in Klingon territory. If we're discovered...
Thank you, Captain Kirk. The evening has been most... edifying.
That's not his knee.  Not everybody keeps their genitals in the same place, Captain.
Sorry -
We're almost at the rendezvous - I thought you'd want to know...
Me?
I am responsible for involving you in this. I will go.
What's she waiting for?
You have done well, Saavik. As your sponsor at the Academy I have followed your career with... satisfaction. And as a Vulcan.
But it was when you tried to persuade me the Captain was guilty that I should have understood.
Praxis?
They're outside the beaming shield. Mr. Scott, start your engines.
They might as well arrest me, too; I felt like Lieutenant Saavik.
Sort of like losing a son and gaining an empath, isn't it?
But we do have one advantage.  He needs your blood to live. He might come after you first.
Data!
Do you think this is a wise course of action?
Ready, Captain.
Since positronic signatures have only been known to emanate from androids such as myself, it is logical to theorize that there is an android such as myself on Kolarus III.
No.
How can you be certain?
I'm afraid that drink will have to wait, Captain.

He thinks he knows exactly what I'm going to do.
So, human... you've met your better self!
I'm preparing her for Shinzon. To sooth him as she soothes you. To stand at his side as she does at yours.
Sir, we're being hailed.
Captain, with all due respect to diplomatic protocols  -- the Federation Council's not sitting out here, we are.
Serving with you has been an honor.
We need to talk, just you and I.
You know I need to verify this.
In time, Jean Luc.
I hope you're still alive, Jean Luc.
Intruder alert!
Join us, Commanders.  Now what's the disposition of the fleet?
And?
What did I tell you?
Well, here we are... You go down that ramp there, you're sure to get a ride.
Why did you let it get into a populated area?
Clarify that.
This is Marc Shermin. Where are you, Mrs. Haydn?
You've been through quite an ordeal, Mrs. Haydn. Why don't you stay where you are and let us pick you up? We'll fly you home.
Steering wheel.
Gear shift.
Dashboard.
What?
Smile... good?
Gas.
What's the matter?
But I must go here.
What is hitchhike?
What happened?
The machine gave me two. Should I put one back?
You can have one.
What?
This is yours...
Tell the baby about me.
Wait. Could I have your autograph?
I'm telling you they're probably friendly.
Nothing up there... The grass is matted down in a few places, but that could have been anything.
Okay, let's get you wired up.  I hope this axle grease you got in your hair doesn't screw up the squid receptors.
This piece of puke hired me to kill you, baby.  Do you believe that? Isn't that right, Tran?  You pinhead.
Believe it.  Now bring me the trodes, baby.  Come on, quick.
Faith, call me, okay?
I understand.  No, I'm not.
I'm telling ya, it's over.  We used it all up--
Mace... no disrespect... but you run this on the 11 o'clock news, by midnight you got the biggest riot in history.  They'll see the fucking smoke from Canada.
So there never was a death squad.
Just those two loose-cannon cops running around covering their butts.
About what?
What the fuck are you doing?
What's that?  Present from Faith?
No more, Lenny.
Will you relax.  There's nobody back there.
You better keep a low profile for a while.
Tell me.
Uh unh.  I won't do it.
I worked Vice, Narcotics... Violent Crimes... and I saw every known depravity.  I was lost, Mace.  In outer darkness.  Then I busted this strung-out little teeny-hooker. When I met Faith she was just another runaway giving twenty dollar blowjobs to buy crank.  Another lost soul.
But she was different.  There was a light in her eyes... and she had this voice.  It was scary, all that pain coming out of that little body. Like she could take all the hurt and rage of the entire world and lift it up to heaven in one voice.  I helped her.  And I promised her that I'd always be there... to protect her.  See?  It's not about what's in her head.  It's what's in mine.  I can't let go of the promise.  It's... like... it's all I have left.
Well...  Get going.  You're still bleeding.
Was this him?
Besides that.
Testa?
Nine bodies in Roswell, now this -- it's getting a little hairy, huh?
Be my guest, Agent Kulok, scrub suits are in the back.
The man who was with him, he was a construction worker?
What did he look like?
How did you know he was a construction worker?
Mackelway, I could understand. He is over-emotional by nature, but you, Agent Kulok, you had a shining career in front of you.
"Murman" was the alter identity of William Heirens, the original "Catch Me Before I Kill Again" killer. Short for "Murder Man." It was the case that got Richard Low and I started in this field.
That gasbag. I can imagine what he said. I'm not ashamed to admit that most of what I know about criminal profiling started with Richard Low. I have also, over the years, I admit, taken credit for many of his accomplishments. He was the most brilliant law enforcement individual I ever met.
We had every reason to believe he was on that plane. He was supposed to be on the plane. Everything was incinerated, it was two weeks before we reached the crash site. We, the Director and I, decided it was in everyone's best interest to declare Dick Low dead. That way he could exit a hero.
Dunlevy said there was another case, Ron Rice. In fact, there were two earlier cases where serials were murdered. The second was George Sheldon. I didn't enter it into VICAP -- I'll get you the file.
Both in the last year. I suspected only someone as brilliant as Dick Low could find these guys.  Look, whatever Daitz told you, nobody wanted to strip Richard of his badge. You have to get close to be good at what he did, the trick is not to get too close.
I suspected, but you were the one Low contacted. That's why I brought you back here.
Agent Kulok, that boy, as we speak, is in Hawkins' truck, probably still alive, in a dark refrigerated compartment, shivering in just a T- shirt: put yourself in his mind, freezing, terrified, wanting his mother. Put yourself in his mother's place, desperate, imagining the worst is happening as she pleads, back there at the rest stop, for someone, anyone, to listen to her. This is not hypothetical, this is real. It is happening now and you can do something about it.
I ever get like that, just take me out in back and shoot me.
I saw him on a talk show once, talking about these killers like they were his friends. Not the victims, not the families of the victims, he doesn't talk about them. Blood money, that's what it is.  Did he hit on you?
When you were his student? Did he come on to you?
You must really think I'm a square, a computer nerd.
There's the Agency issue. I think Koessler may suspect something already. We're not on the best footing with him as it is.
Then there's the other issue.
You need time to think. About the case, about you and me.
And nobody else can do that?
That's my point. Remember, you're a cop pretending to be a deviant. It's not the other way around.
I haven't changed anything.  Damn.
Who are you?
Was it Zero?
"Computer Investigation and Infrastructure Assessment Center." Quantico out of MIT -- you're a techie?  Okay, you screwed up once. So did half the guys here. That's why they're here.
I see that. Washington to Philadelphia to here. Philly's a nice station. How many agents?
"Attitude Adjustment Issues" -- what the fuck is that supposed to mean?
This is a first. You criticized the Deputy Director to his face and you still have a badge? You must have some one-of-a-kind skills.  Why don't you just quit? I mean, you're not going to get promoted, not wearing this jacket.
You want to "profile" me? Find out what makes me "tick"? Write about me, go on a talk show, give me a nickname?
...so I thought, what the hell, they make movies in L.A., not in Michigan, so I moved here.
Well, it wasn't the simple, but yeah.
Well, I left someone very special behind.
You too?
I thought I was going to die.
Oh, God. That's two more than me. Tell me it gets better.
How?
Like what?
...I heard it took four days to light for that shot...
He's so sweet. He really said that?
Sorry, it's just that...
Hi.
Yeah, uh, I don't think that's gonna be happening any time soon... Listen, can I call you right back? I gotta take this call...
I really want to catch up with you, but I've gotta take this call. They're holding. I'll talk with you when you get back in town. Bye.
I can't get over how cute the girls in this city are.
Darwinism at its best.
It's like, every day I see a beautiful woman. I'm not used to that. I'm used to seeing a beautiful woman, I don't know, once a week. I can't handle it.
I can't wait till I actually get to touch one of them.
Uuuuugh!
I'm such an asshole.
...which means no one will get there 'til ten.
You live in such a fantasy world...
...It was six months, and she didn't dump...
There you two are. I walked around for an hour with that stupid martini on my tray.
Pirates of the fucking Caribbean.
This is fuckin' post-pubescent Disneyland.
Nice, baby.
Baby, you did fine.
...Baby...
You did fine. Don't sweat her. We're meeting our honeys soon. You know Christy's friend is going to be money.
Baby, relax. It's just down the hall. She's gotta change... we'll be fine.
No.
We got the digits, baby.
Because he's a bitch.
Baby, don't talk that way, baby...
It's on...
This is Tom Hagen; I'm calling for Don Corleone, at his request.
Don't be frightened.  Do you think I'd make my sister a widow?  Do you think I'd make your children fatherless?  After all, I'm Godfather to your son.  No, your punishment is that you're out of the family business.  I'm putting you on a plane to Vegas--and I want you to stay there.  I'll send Connie an allowance, that's all. But don't keep saying you're innocent; it insults my intelligence and makes me angry.  Who approached you, Tattaglia or Barzini?
I want somebody very good, very safe to plant that gun.  I don't want my brother coming out of that toilet with just his dick in his hand.
You're on, kid...I'll square it with Mom your not seeing her before you left.  And I'll get a message to your girl friend when I think the time is right.
My business is heroin, I have poppy fields, laboratories in Narseilles and Sicily, ready to go into production.  My importing methods are as safe as these things can be, about five per cent loss.  The risk is nothing, the profits enormous.
I need two million dollars in cash...more important, I need a friend who has people in high places; a friend who can guarantee that if one of my employees be arrested, they would get only light sentences.  Be my friend.
Thirty per cent.  In the first year your share would be four million dollars; then it would go up.
It is Johnny.  He came all the way from California to be at the wedding.
No.  Let the people enjoy him.  You see?  He is a good godson.
I see you have your Luca Brasi.
You had better bring a few bottles home with you, my friend; you'll need help sleeping tonight. 
I know about what you mean!
Beautiful all over, eh?
Is the hospital covered?
Kay, we weren't expecting you.  You should call...
Mike, why are you cutting me out of the action?
I didn't know your family knew Johnny Fontane.
I used to come down to New York whenever he sang at the Capitol and scream my head off.
When will I see you again?
Clemenza?  No, I don't believe it.
How can you be sure?
We're going to New Jersey?
Buy me out?...
What? What?
Well, she was already dead, darling, wasn't she, so I suppose --
Good afternoon!
I can't write and I can't spell. That's the privilege of a first-class education. You're upstairs at the back. I think Ermelinda made the bed up.
Means we never shared a bath. I'm cold. Can I get in?
I didn't mean with you in it.
I wanted to tell you my plan.
I thought I might come back. In the New Year. Under my own steam.
Of course. Let's say, for argument's sake, you were here -- perhaps we could split the rent on a house -- I'll get a job -- or, better still, I could get a place in Rome and when we're there we could be there and if we're here we could be here --
You see, particularly with the Marge problem, you can just blame me.
How?
Yesterday you're ogling girls on the terrace, today you're getting married. It's absurd.
You love me and you're not marrying me.
No, no, it's not a threat, I've explained all of that.
No. No, I'm staying here for a few days, in Rome. That's a new piano, so you prob --
Pretty good. Sticking with hot water.
I never said that!
Hello Marge.
How are you? Sorry. Is your book going well?
I was just looking at you --  so quiet.
I think he's planning on staying in Rome for a few days.
I don't know. I don't understand Dickie, Marge, so your guess is as good as mine.
Well, one day I'm invited skiing, the next day I'm not, one day we're all one family, the next day he wants to be alone. You tell me.
Look at me what?
Dickie? Do you know Dickie?
I told you! I knew it!
How would you know that?
What's your secret?
Dickie, my God!
I was looking at you, your clothes, I wouldn't have known you...
What?
Yes, what happened? I heard you were desperate to come. I was looking forward to rowing you around.
Well hurry, before we sink.  Should I give you my telephone number in Venice?
He wants to know if you killed Freddie Miles and then killed Dickie Greenleaf?
He's already angry, I don't think --
Good things about Tom Ripley? Could take some time!... Tom is talented. Tom is tender... Tom is beautiful...
Some of these guns are like toys, but a Smith and Wesson, man, you can hit somebody over the head with it and it will still come back dead on. Nothing beats quality.  You interested in an automatic?
Travis, I never ever met anybody like you before.
Where do you live?
So why did you decide to drive a taxi at night?
After this job, I'm looking forward to being alone for a while.
What kind of people?
Really?
What did you do?
That's really something.
The moon?
...there's plenty of movies around here. I haven't seen any of them, but I'm sure they're good.
You mean you don't want to go to a movie?  There's plenty of movies around here.
Huh?
But... Betsy...
Try holding the match like this.
This I gotta see.
Oh, are you all right?
No. I just wanted to see if you could light it that way. The guy at the newsstand can.
He happens to be missing fingers. I first noticed when --
No, why?
He's Black, OK?
As I said, he isn't Italian. Besides, I thought they just killed them.
Why don't they leave a pigeon instead of a canary?
First, he's not Italian. Second he's not a thief. I noticed the fingers when he was getting my change -- the right change. Two of his fingers are missing. Just stubs. Like they were blown away. I was putting my change in my purse when I saw him get out a cigarette. I couldn't help watching. I was dying to see how he'd light it.
No, stupid. With the stubs. That's the whole point.
No, this is young -- well, I'm never sure how old Black people are -- but, anyway, he isn't old. That's for sure.
Yeah. We went to Harvard together. 
Hello.
Well... I guess so.
...and after that Sport and I just started hanging out...
Travis, what single thing would you want the next President of this country to do most?
There must be something...
Look, um, if you give me your name and address, we'll send you the information on how to apply.
Sure.
Sure, Henry. I got it all. We'll send you all the stuff all right.
Look, a person does a certain thing and that's all there is to it. It becomes what he is. Why fight it? What do you know? How long you been a hack, a couple months? You're like a peg and you get dropped into a slot and you got to squirm and wiggle around a while until you fit in.
What do you expect, Bertrand Russell? I've been a cabbie all my life, what do I know?  I don't even know what you're talking about.
You fit in. It's lonely, it's rough at first. But you fit in. You got no choice.
Don't worry, Killer. You'll be all right.  I seen enough to know.
It's me sir.
Limp dick?
St. Michael's Church, Fort Walton, Kansas.  Front pew.  Right leg. = Hollow.
Tell them Pete.  Tell them...
You can all go home, now.  He's not going anywhere.
Were we going to get married?
Delly, shhhhhh...
I'm a little hesitant to say.
Are you saying that he's...
Nine and-a-half years ago.
But I...
I'm here.
Did I what?
I know.  Everyone went home.  We offered them refunds.
A few.
Do you remember if you were driving a car?  Maybe you went over the bridge.  No guard rail there, it's easy to do.  It's happened before.
And you don't know your name or who you are, that right?
You think he's drunk somewhere?
Well, his rent's past due and he said to call you in case of an emergency.  He lose his job or somethin'?
Her name was right there in front of them.  They gave it to me, I didn't give it to them.
Leo, she was... she was a girl I knew in college...
Oh god, oh, god, no, I...
Thank me publicly?  For what?  For ruining this woman's life?
Can I... Can I t-t-talk to you?
I suppose.  Thanks.
I've been wanting a cigarette for the past twenty minutes, but I couldn't convince myself to stop. This 'tilling of the soil' can get a little compulsive, you know.
Thank you. It gives me something to do with my spare time.  There's a lot of spare time in Bodega Bay.  Did you plan on staying long?
You're leaving after you see Cathy?
Thank you.
Mitch, can I bring the lovebirds in here?
Mom, they're in a cage!
Mitch? Why are they doing this?  The birds.
Why are they trying to kill people?
How much for the phone calls?
Gulls!
She's a charming girl, isn't she, Mitch?
And certainly pretty.
How long have you known her?
In a bird shop.
She was selling birds.
But she did buy the lovebirds and then brought them all the way...
Forgive me. I suppose I'm just naturally curious about a girl like that.  She's very rich, isn't she?
You'd think he could manage to keep her name out of print. She's always mentioned in the columns, Mitch.
She is the one who jumped into that fountain in Rome last summer, isn't she?
Perhaps I'm old-fashioned.  I know it was supposed to be very warm there, Mitch, but... well... actually... well, the newspaper said she was naked.
It's none of my business, of course, but when you bring a girl like that to...
Yes?
Well...  So long as you know what you want, Mitch.
They're gone. The same pattern.
We won't be here.
I want to try for San Francisco. There are buildings there. Steel and concrete!
We have to try it.  We can't stay here.  Melanie needs help.  Mother, the house won't take another attack.
They won't be.
We'll worry about that when we get there.
What do we have to know, Mother? We're all together, we all love each other, we all need each other. What else is there? Mother, I want us to stay alive!
That's a chimney swift, all right.
Well, where did he go?
Bodega Bay? Where's that?
Sixty...  Oh.
Oh.
Yes. Yes, someone's got to feed them.
So you came up to see Annie, huh?
I don't believe you.  I think you came up to see me.
I don't know. But it seems to me you must have gone to a lot of trouble to find out who I was, and where I lived and...
You like me, huh?
What did it say?
I really shouldn't have any more. I'm a little tipsy already.
I couldn't possibly. I have to get back.
What it was, probably...
They're probably hungry, that's all. This was a bad summer. They eat berries and... and nuts, you know, and the hills are all burned out, so they're probably searching for food wherever they can get it.
When will they stop?
What time is it?
You must be exhausted.
That... that... who was that?
Doesn't it seem odd that they'd wait all that time to start a... a war against humanity?
Then fight back. Get yourselves guns and wipe them off the face of the earth.
Dr. MacFarlane said I should pay you --
Even so, I could never think of going on -- I've got to find some other profession.
You know how we get the specimens we use for dissection?
But, I didn't ask him to kill.
This is not a woman!
He'll not leave the grave -- not since Wednesday last when we buried the lad.
Oh, it's you, Gray. Well, come in. Sit down. Have a glass with me.
Have another glass of something good, Toddy.
You and I should work together.
No digging Joseph. The churchyards are too well guarded. We will "Burke" them,
You are lately come to Scotland, Joseph?
And why not?  He's a good lad -- bright and able.
You think it'll spoil the boy, eh? Was I not assistant to Knox?
Was that it? Well, ok.
Fuck! What do you want?
Fucking Zombie.
I've been shot, and stabbed and thrown from a car and none of it hurt. But what you're doing now, does. I don't know why.
... it connects you to me...
Maybe we had a case of that here.  Get me my kit.
I want to take this to Lauren. She'd want it.
Stay in the car. I'll only take a second.
You should see it, Professor Barnhardt! You should go out and see it for yourself!
The whole city has stopped. People are running around like ants!
Bet he is, Mom. Bet he's out looking for that space man.
Now think back hard. You didn't follow Mr. Carpenter at all, did you? You haven't even been out of the house.
You think they'll ever find him?
Mr. Carpenter -- what does velocity mean?
Aw, gee -- we didn't finish our story.
We could call a special meeting of the General Assembly... But of course the UN doesn't represent all of the nations.
I wonder if we ought to--
You think it's all right for you to stay here?
Excuse me. I was just going up to my room.
Where are you going now?
Oh, I see. He was having trouble and you were helping him out.
I suppose you know that Barnhardt does a lot of secret work for the Army.
But I suppose you know the answer.
All day.
Okay.  Where's Nosferatu?
The nightcrawler.  The bloodsucker.
So how do you like those maggots, Michael?
You can't kill me, Star.
Just so you know:  If you try to stop us, or vamp-out in any way, I'll stake you without thinking twice about it.
Lucy, you're the only woman I ever knew didn't improve her situation by getting divorced.
Hi... I'm Laddie.
Sure.
We are...
Lights out, Sam.
You've got a generous nature.  I like that in a person.  My name is Max.
So what can I help you find tonight, Lucy?  We've got it all.  Best selection in Santa Carla.
-- a job.
Something the matter?
Let me tell you something about boys.  They're like weeds.  They grow best when they're ignored.
What's your name?
Oh.  Your folks, too, huh?
Ex-hippies.  My mom was one.   I came this close to being called Moon Child, or Moon Beam or something.  But Star's great.  I <u>like</u> Star.
I'm Michael.
They'll be coming for Laddie and me, won't they?
Go away.
What did you to do him, Michael? Why did he bite you?
Pretty nasty out, Mac.  Thirty-five knots.
Couldn't make much of it myself.
Sure.  You think there's a connection?
How you doin', old boy?
Know what you mean, Blair.  Trust is a tough thing to come by these days. Just trust in the Lord.
What?
Could have been anytime.  Anywhere.
Cut him loose of the line up by his shack.
What do we do about those three?
Load of bullshit.
Well, who's got access to it?
I don't see how... when I'm finished I return it right away.
You're not thinking of going after them, are you?
How's that Thing get to the dogs?  I though we stopped it in time.
What if it doesn't come?
Get back!!
It's got into the pub!  It's turned on the stereo!
It's in between us and them!!  How we going to get back?!
I had a friend who came here once. Sort of a dare.
So, Relic, you want to open Pandora's box, do you?  See all the mysteries exposed?
And if the truth is so horrible that it will haunt your dreams for all time?
They raise them like cattle... Feed them until they're ready and then hunt them.
Why?
So you take their best...
You took her because she helped me.
May I help you?
I am the Fifth Avenue Public Library informational kiosk.  VOX registration NY-114.  May I help you?
Let's walk through the park...
Let them.
It's my Jamie's birthday today. Your godson.  He's nine years old. At his party he asked me if Uncle Alex was coming.  I told him no. Then he asked me if you didn't like him anymore.
There are some things I need to say to you.  You may not like hearing them, but I don't know if I'll ever get another chance --
But you won't listen.  You won't see me, you won't see anyone.  What would you like me to tell Jamie? That Uncle Alex is busy?  That Uncle Alex is hiding up there in his laboratory --
You know that's what it is.  Mrs. Watchit tells me you're here at all hours -- day and night --
Did you hear me, lad?
Why?
... It was a great city.  The greatest city in the world.
Oh, very much...  ... I used to work somewhere in that direction, I think.  A huge university where we taught everything from botany to history to literature.
Oh very.  Learning, commerce, the arts -- the whole place was buzzing all the time.  Night and day.
Only to keep warm.  For illumination we had gaslights on most of the streets and a new invention called electrical lighting that made it seem like daylight all through the night.
Oh, it was...  ... Most of the time.
Oh huzzah, the master's home.
Yes, sir.
My fowl have polluted the yard.
I don't know what to tell you, sir. He's been gone this whole week.
Relax.
You died, Starks. Years ago, in the hospital.
No. I didn't. I swear I didn't. I probably helped push you to kill yourself, but I didn't do it.
We're late.
I'm sorry? Your face looks awfully familiar, I just can't quite place it...
Stop it! Stop it! JACKIE covers her ears and looks at him, pleading with her eyes. STARKS' eyes plead right back.
You can't be William Starks. He's dead.
William Starks is dead... [Beat] I've been to his grave.
I don't believe a thing she just said.
I have no idea.
Maybe. I don't know. Seems more likely Becker does, but at the very least she knows how I died.
Why?
They've got lives to be grateful for.
I think so.
At the end, he made me change my mind about a lot of things.
I don't know. [Frustrated] Remember?
[Beat] I've seen a time that's not this time. And I'm only able to see it when I'm in the Jacket.
I'm not gonna let that happen.
I do believe you...
Oh no, you're pretty young. Your body'll be able to handle a lot more of it than you think...
In case you hadn't figured, it's Christmas Eve. You're never gonna get a cab here.
You want a drink?
Damnit, Thelma, don't holler like that!  Haven't I told you I can't stand it when you holler in the morning.
How do you know I took it?  How do you know they didn't just give it to me?
This is serious, son.  A man is dead.
Your name's Harlan?  I got an uncle named Harlan!
Louise, is that you?
I am funny.  I'm real funny.
No, I'm out of town.  I'm in... I'm in real deep shit, Jimmy.  Deep shit Arkansas.
Okay, peaches, okay.  But can I ask you one thing?
Does it have something to do with another guy?  Are you in love with him?
Is this your car?
You wanna come with me, please? Walk around and get in the car, please.
Front.
Jeez, Louise, that wasn't very nice.
So what if he was?  It's all your years of waitin' tables has made you jaded, that's all.
We're gonna go to the next town and stop.  We'll get a motel room.  I can rest for a while and then figure out how to get some money.  We're gonna need money.  Thelma.  How much money do you have with you?
I just don't see what it would hurt just to give somebody a ride.  Did you see his butt?  Darryl doesn't have a cute butt.  You could park a car in the shadow of his ass.
Well, it looks like we can get on this road 81 that heads down towards Dallas, then cut over to...
Wait.  What?  You want to go to Mexico from Oklahoma and you don't want to go through Texas?
I know, Louise, but we're running for our lives!  Don't you think you could make an exception just this once?!  I mean, look at the map. The only thing between Oklahoma and Mexico is Texas!
Eighty-eight dollars ain't gonna make a dent, baby girl.
Fill her up.  There's a phone right over there.
Oh, Christ.  I hate this guy.
Ready?
He said they're charging us with murder.
And we have to decide whether we want to come out of this dead or alive.
How far are we from Mexico?
You're a good friend.
Isn't that just my luck -- I get caught for everything.
You're leaving it out. Finish your swing.  You're going to like this one -- she's half Asian, half American.
Mary's a babe!
My Mary -- she's not in Japan, she's single, and she's got no rugrats. She does have a little gambling problem, she plays the football cards a bit too much, but she's a babe, a surgeon babe!
Think about it: After you've had sex with a girl and the two of you are laying in bed, are you nervous?
Woogie from Borrington high? Sounds like a loser.
Okay? With this pad, the killer wheels? Looks like you really cleaned up your act.
Fuckin' animals. Hey, what do you say we go grab a couple drinks.
Why didn't you just tell her the truth?
What are you doing with all these blueprints?
Are you... an architect?
Ah, I'd sell that. Start fresh in a new place, quit the architect game, slow things down, read more books, see more movies...
Try to be. It's tough going with the crap they make today. If Dumb and Dumber's the best they've got to offer I say thanks but no thanks.
No. But the Boston Globe critic Jay Carr hated it.
Are you okay?
But you know, you shit out a bunch of kids, you're going to put on a few pounds.
Nope. Never been.
Four kids, three different guys.
Well I'm guessing. There's a black kid, two whites, and a midget.
Hyperactive little fuckers, too. Tough to keep up with in a wheelchair, I bet.
You fucked me, man? Why would you do that?
Okay, Pat, take it easy -- don't do anything stupid.
I swear! I didn't tell her nothing! You probably did it yourself, you piece of shit.
Like I'm going to try to figure out a guy who's idea of courting is blowing farts in the chick's face
Have you been up all night again?
Neighborhood Watch? Is that what you call listening in on stranger's phone conversations?
Meaning?
You picked that up on the scanner. We gotta move.
Don't bet on it. Last time I had a pap smear the guy needed leather gloves and an oyster shucker.
Knock it off, Pollyanna, just 'cause you're in love doesn't mean everyone else has to be.
He's a nice guy, isn't he?
Name's Norm. I live up in Pompano with my folks.
Oh my God... Ted.  What are you...? I can't believe this. I haven't seen you since --
And did everything -- ?
You hit the ball pretty good for a fourteen.
That's really sweet, Ted, but you should save it for one of your books.
Get over here.
Teddy, hon, are you okay?  OH HEAVENS TO PETE!
Just relax, dear. Now, um... what exactly are we looking at here?
We're here, Warren. You wanna get off?
This private assurance represents the word of the Highest Authority?
And it can be relayed beyond Comrade Khruschev's ears to the top circles of my government
We're going to have to stop a ship eventually, show the quarantine's got teeth, or we'll prove McCone right.
Adlai's too weak! We have to convince Jack to pull him, get McCloy in there.
Zorin will eat him alive!
Yeah?
And the second condition?
Does this attack on our plane represent a definitive, intentional escalation on the part of the Soviets?
Secretary of Defense...
Call me Irish, but I don't believe in cooler heads prevailing.
We can horsetrade with Khruschev on ships. But it doesn't get us any closer to removing those missiles.
At least it will expose whether Khruschev has been overthrown. We'll know what we're dealing with.
Anyone stops us going in, we're with the Bowen-Hamilton Textile Company. We have rug samples.
Levoi, Cooch. Raymond Levoi, Criminal Division.
Respect the dead, Hoss. Because when --
-- violation of the Major Crimes Act on an Indian Reservation is within the jurisdiction of the Federal Bureau of Instigation. I know that.
I did.
White eagle feather through the circle. That's their symbol.
Alright. Alright...
Come on, Ray. Come forward.
Why does he wanna see me?
Jimmy didn't do it, Ray. I checked it out. You can stop taggin' my sister.
Still after Jimmy?
This Clear Moon's house?
You take care.
X22. Read.
I have a pick-up truck. No plates. Subject -- Indian -- entering suspect's house. Over.
You ever try solitary confinement?
Washington sent ya. I know that.
Yeah, most likely.
The what?
Does it bother you?
...they say you're alright.
This is it, then.
The dark side. The price you pay for all the fun you're having. You knew about it, of course. Didn't you?
That's not what I hear.
That's what you get flight pay for.
Why? You act like you didn't know one day this would happen.
You didn't mean it. You didn't think. You'd do anything to take it back.
Yes, Sergeant?
Sir?
Help me with this one, I'm really screwed up.
This is crazy!
Wait! Hell!..Something's wrong!
Were upside down!
Can't you feel it? I'm hanging in my straps!
They must be broken. I'm hanging in my straps! We're inverted!
Ohhh Mother!
Let me do the talking.
Nice. Always a good idea to show up your instructors. He nods toward Jester, glaring at them from his A4. Goose indicates the backseat of the Tomcat.
Ahhh...A little high on the left, don't you think?
Relationships are a bitch, here. It's hard enough to concentrate ...under the pressure. Having a woman here is asking for it.
But, Skipper, Cougar's been picked for Top Gun...He's the best of the best!
GET OUT OF THERE, YOU'RE UNSAFE. GET OUT OF THERE.
GET LOST!
I don't know what to tell you, Skip.
Morning, Coogan.
SNAPSHOT..MISSED HIM..
What's wrong with this one?
Need a ride?
Well, my boy, you're a hero.
He had help.  From our side, sir.
But I thought...
Okay, this is what we're gonna do. Renata, cover up any memory he has of us or Rekall.
Ernie, dump him in a cab.  Around the corner.  Tiffany, you help him.  I'll destroy his file and refund his money.  And if anybody comes asking...we've never heard of Douglas Quaid.
You're strapped into an implant chair, and I'm monitoring you at a psycho-probe console.
Not exactly.  What you're experiencing is a free-form delusion based on our memory tapes.  But you're inventing it yourself as you go along.
I've been artificially implanted as an emergency measure.  I'm sorry to tell you this, Mr. Quaid, but you've suffered a schizoid embolism. We can't snap you out of your fantasy. I've been sent in to try to talk you down.
Think about it.  Your dream started in the middle of the implant procedure. Everything after that--the chases, the trip to Mars, your suite here at the Hilton--these are all elements of your Rekall Holiday.  And Ego Trip: You paid to be a secret agent.
What about the girl?  Brunette, athletic, sleazy and demure; just like you specified.  Is that a coincidence?
Mr. Quaid, can you hear yourself? "She's real because you dreamed her?"
If we don't hand you over, everybody in the sector'll be dead by morning.
You shoulda listened to me, Quaid. I was there to keep you outta trouble.
Look at this shit.
...You mean it?
You call this a paranoid delusion?!
Let's see...the basic Mars package will run you just eight hundred and ninety-nine credits.  That's for two full weeks of memories, complete in every detail.  --A longer trip'll run you a little more, cause you need a deeper implant.
First of all, Doug, when you go Rekall, you get nothing but first class memories: private cabin on the shuttle; deluxe suite at the Hilton; plus all the major sights:  Mount Pyramid, the Grand Canals, and of course...  Venusville.
As real as any memory in your head.
I'm telling you, Doug, your brain won't know the difference.  Guaranteed, or your money back.
I don't remember you.
Not bad, for a hooker.
What's wrong?
What?  Well, for chrissake, we could have made a stand at our place!  We had food, water...
Negative copy on that, Pham, check your frequency.  I'm on forty-nine.
There's nothing like them in the fossil record, I'm sure...Okay, so they predate the fossil record...  That'd make them a couple of billion years old...and we've just never seen one till now.  Right.
Hi, guys.  Burt loaned me his camera.
You're really leaving, huh?
Catch it later, Pham.  Gotta get over to Nestor's.
You're full of shit.
Slick as snot and I'm not lying.
Pham Van don't get his mitts on <u>this</u> for no measly fifteen bucks!
Don't he have a home to go to?
Watch your ass, shithead.
Christ, Val, maybe she's not your type, but you could, at least, be civil.
Val, we're going to have to forget about the truck...
Hi, I'm Rhonda.  Rhonda LeBeck. I'm up here for the semester...
Look, the situation hasn't changed. We still have to get to solid rock. There must be <u>some</u> way!
The photo on the left shows the bullet that killed Jimmy Chin, true?
And the one on the right is the bullet you test-fired from Shu's gun?
Objection.
No it's not the only issue. There's another issue, for the jury. What about entrapment?
It's just... I leave behind friends, family, a coupla good job offers in Chicago and in three dizzying weeks I've helped acquit a coke dealer, a speed dealer --
-- an angel dust dealer --
-- a speed manufacturer --
Don't tell me where to work. I moved to New York to work for Edward Dowd. But I can't believe that Edward Dowd has nothing better to do these days than invoke exalted legal issues to get off guilty little --
Eddie... What's a DD-5?
-- Listen: "November 5, 1980. Cecil Stipe walked into 5th Precinct. Says he witnessed Chin shooting, saw suspect's picture in Post. Says Shu Kai Kim wrong man."
So what're we gonna do?
Well, I mean, Roeder's gone, now... A dead end. Believe me, I'm sorry too, but...
I've heard from the last ballistics expert on the list. It's an even ten who say Shu's gun killed Jimmy Chin!
Eddie... it's one thing to compare Clyde Gruner to Jesus Christ. It's even okay to claim that Shu Kai Kim is just slightly holier than the Pope... as long as you don't really believe it!
-- Eddie...
Pardon... Which dialect do you speak?
A fucking wheelchair?
But why would a guy would do that? Paint black teardrops on his face?
But why?
Afraid of what?
-- About what?
What went down?
No. You tell me, Shu.
You can't. So tell me what you do know -- say it!
Are you willing to testify that the man you saw shoot Jimmy Chin was not the man the cops arrested?
When the D.A. hears I filed the writ, he'll send someone here, maybe claiming to be a journalist. That person will ask you lots of questions. Just be truthful, Cecil, okay? To all of us?
I'll prosecute anyone who fucks up. If that makes me look racist, it's a trade-off I'll live with, Ed.
Lou Sklaroff, Vin Badalato, Dave Montell.
What were you... Why were you at Shu's trial this afternoon?
I think what Eddie wants to say is --
Here he comes.
GOD. I'm beginning to lose faith in the United States Government and that includes the telephone system. Don't you folks talk to one another. That's her trailer there and I haven't touched a god damn thing. Agent Chet Desmond come by a second time and asked too see Deputy Cliff Howard's trailer  ...which I showed him. I went back to my trailer...  After that I never saw him again.
What are you doing here in the trailer court, Deputy?
Can I ask you where you were the night Teresa Banks was murdered?
QUICKLY MEN... WORD ASSOCIATION, COOP. WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW?
He's with me.  Anything you would like to tell us about Teresa Banks that would help us out?
Accidental?
I couldn't help but notice that you had a suspicion that Deputy Cliff was the murderer. You did think that, didn't you, Agent Desmond?
Laura?
No.  I don't need to take this to be your friend.
You're not Bob are you, Harold? If you are, you can kill me right now. Kill me right now, if you are.
I've got to see you.
This afternoon?
What about tonight?
What's going on?
You lied to me about those school books. I found them upstairs on your bed.
I was looking for that blue sweater that you borrowed which I found balled up in the bottom of your closet. Now why did you lie to me? Where did you go?
Oh, honey, you don't have to lie to me. Ever. You can tell me anything. I'll understand.
Who was that?
Did you get this from your lover?
Bobby didn't give you this?
Come back as soon as you can.
This is going to drive the ante up.
Your Honor, Bishop Brophy and the Archdiocese have offered plaintiff two hundred and ten thousand dollars.
Mary Rooney, the obstetrical nurse...
We went to Code Blue...
It's a common medical expression, it's a crash program to restore the heartbeat. Dr. Marx cut an airway in her trachea, to get her oxygen, her and the baby... Ms. Nevins...
Well, many reasons, actually...
She'd aspirated vomitus into her mask...
Dr. Thompson. From your review of the hospital records of May twelfth nineteen seventy-six.
Cardiac arrest. During delivery her heart stopped. When the heart stops the brain's deprived of oxygen. You get brain damage. That is why she's in the state she's in today.
I appreciate -- a man as busy as --
Thank you.
Who told you that?
Mrs. Simmonds.
I used to be a nurse.
Do we have time this morning to...  All right. Mr. Galvin, you want to continue now, or we can resume with Dr. Thompson this afternoon.
Would you like me to leave...?  Is this a bad time -- ?
Is this a bad time.
What happened...?
Mr. Galvin's...
I... please. My wife... my wife's prescription has run out. If I can call him...
No, no, no. I have to talk to him. If I can only call him...
Jimmy? Bushmills.  Lookit, do me a favor. I'll buy you a drink tomorrow.
'You guys are a bunch of whores... uh... loyalty... you don't care who gets hurt... you don't have any loyalty...'
Who? They're all testifying. Everybody who was in the O.R.'s going to take the stand.
Dr. Towler...
You have a record of what happened in the operating room...
...there are notations every thirty seconds...
...of the procedures...
But those notations stop...  ...Four-and-one-half minutes after Deborah Ann Kaye's...
Four-and-one-half minutes after her heart stopped.  And they resume seven minutes...
...they start again three minutes earlier...
What happened in those three...
What happened in those three minutes...?
There's only one thing that will stop the Martians!  We've held back pre- viously because of the danger of radiation to civilians.  Now there's no choice.  The United Nations has voted authority to the United States.  The White House will confirm an order to use the Atom bomb.
They've all stopped at the same time.
I've been as close to them as anyone. But not close enough for real observation...
That's what knocked the phones out, too.
Colonel - shooting's no good!
Number three to. D.O....Number three to D.O.
We're getting this under control. Won't need any more help.  Over.
I think somebody ought to check on it. Over.
Bob, how long has Wes been working on this script?
And since you've been thinking of making it.  Has anything funny happened?
What's up?
Heather, I'm stuck here.  Neither Chuck or Terry came in today.  I can't get away!
Ms. Langenkamp.  I suggest you go home and get some rest.  Your son is fine. He's been taken downstairs for further testing.
He was here.  You fell asleep.  We took him.  You looked so exhausted, frankly, we didn't wake you.  Besides, the young woman, Julie, is with him.  Believe me, everything is fine.
Time for sleep.
And...what's the man doing?
Yes.  It's a story.  A story for a movie.
Freddy, for all I know.
Heather, what is it?
Isn't there anyone that can stop him?
Me?  Why me?
That was Nancy, not me!
He would have loved this.
All his years at sea, he never stopped talking about these islands.
We'll bear off to port and run down wind.
Make us proud.
Yeah.
I couldn't have done it without you.
Can we talk?
How ya doing?
Good.
That's how he died you know.
My brother.  He fell out of the old beech tree.  Broke his neck.  I was on a camp out.  They started going at it, throwin' things, a real knock down...  They didn't find him 'till the next morning.  They didn't even know why he was up there.
Shouldn't we turn away?
Why didn't you turn hard to port as the wind hit?
What is it we can do for you today?
Immortality.
And being sixteen.
What's that?
I'll read it.  I mean I don't mind.
This isn't just a story!!  It's history made allegory.  It is a philosophical handbook for life!  It holds the secret of this very voyage.
They're waving... handkerchiefs or something.
Do you have something to say?
Is it true that you forced Robin Weathers to climb the mast when it was clear that he was acrophobic.
Soon as we ship it'll be "forgetta".
Bobby Peru grab you now... Hold you tight... Feel everythin' in you now... Stay quiet... Say "fuck me" and then I'll leave.
How much money you have between the two a'ya right now?...
Hey!!!... Johnnie Farragut. How are you, my man.
Everythin's relative. Where's that Marietta Pace Fortune? You two didn't split up, I hope.
What'll it be? The regular? Black Label?
Mr. San Pedro Sula's authorized to carry a .45.
General Osvaldo Tamarindo y Ramirez. Telefono 666.
Maybe I was there, but I didn't see anythin'. All I know's that trash killed a man with his bare hands. Hands which are now prob'ly all over my baby!
Nothin', honey.  Mama's just actin' strange.
You're terrible crude sometimes, Sailor, you know?
Sailor?
Wouldn't it be fabulous if we somehow stayed in love for the rest of our lives?
Oh, you know exactly what I mean, honey? It'd make the future so simple and nice.
I just think about things as they come up. I never been much of a planner.
Sorry, baby... When's the first time you done it with a girl who wasn't hookin'?
Got you a pack of Mores again, huh?
Heard on the radio how doctors is usin' leeches again, just in old times. You know, when even barbers used 'em?
Sometimes dreams just don't mean nothin'... Stuff comes into your mind and you don't have no control over, you know? Anyways, dreams ain't no odder than real life. Sometimes not by half.
I was just wastin' time, peanut, till you come back.
Honey, I'm sorry. It wasn't nothin'. Come on and get up and we'll take off.
I can't take this, Sailor. She's dyin' right in front of our eyes...
Sailor? You know what?
I'm sorry, Sailor. I just can't help it. Give me a minute and I'll quit.
Really, Sail, I'll be okay.
What're you talkin' about? That's your son in there.
How can you say that, Sailor?
I'm afraid his car is gone, Mrs. Fortune.
Perhaps we should call a local law enforcement officer.
Hey, Sailor boy, you wanna fuck Lula's mama?...
You snore.
No offense, Professor Tripp, but you look sorta crappy.
Trip??
Left you...? Who? Emily?
Shit.
Oh, Christ, don't start on ol' Gran or we'll leave you here.
Christ, Tripp. How did you know?
I passed out.
I've been doing that a lot lately.
Do you think that's why I've been having these...  ...spells?
The last month maybe.
Spiro T. Agnew was vice president, I believe.
I've been trying to finish a book...
Is that in my chart?
Right. Well, thanks. For the lift.
Sure.
You cold, James?
So what are you doing out here?
Do you have a mirror? It's the best way to see if someone's breathing.
I'm okay. I just lost my balance.
Oh.
I can't help myself. I don't know what's the matter with me.
Want one. They're incredible. Incredible.
You're lying.
Yes you are. My stuff stinks. I know it. You said so yourself.
Yes you did. Last night. To your friend Crabtree. "Is he any good?" he said. And you said: "Not yet he isn't." I heard you myself.
It's okay, Professor Tripp. Carrie, Howard, the others -- they're right. My stories are annoying. They go on and on and on, and the longer they go on the more annoying they become, until finally you just want to grab something heavy and --
Get out of here.
I've been re-reading Arsonist's Daughter. It's so beautiful, Grady. So natural. It's like all your sentences always existed, just waiting around in Style Heaven, or wherever, for you to fetch them down.
And I love the inscription you wrote to me. Only I'm not quite the downy innocent you think I am.
He cribbed that from Borges.
Emily left me this morning.
I can't believe you hung up on me, you dick.
This is not what the university has in mind when it promises a liberal education, Grady.
That perfume you're wearing, Antonia. It wouldn't happen to be Cristaile, would it?
Who's this ?
Grady?
I know it's you, Grady, I just... Christ, Grady, do you know what time it is?
It's three-thirty, Grady.
Oh?
What is it, Grady?
Excuse me?
Holy shit. Are you serious?
Are you riding with me, James?
Living across the street from a grade school. Jesus.
I was just thinking of... the noise.
I've got some pictures.  Want to see?
Ah, come on.
They're starlings.
I don't like starlings.
They're extremely aggressive birds. Plus, their habits are rather filthy.
What's up?
This one guy on death row, who I'll call Henry, told me about his last victim. Henry says how he's in the bedroom of a seven-year-old cutie named Adele. Her mother's in the living room watching TV. She's got the volume on so damn high he can hear David Letterman's jokes. Henry puts his hand over Adele's mouth and says, "If you scream, little girl, I'll kill your mother." And of course little Adele doesn't scream, doesn't cry, doesn't make a sound. Then he takes her hand and out they go through the front door.  Ten days later they find Adele's body. Or what's left of it.  You believe in fairy tales?
Do you believe in them?
Neither do I.  What's the one with the woodsman?
The one with the ax?
Sure you do. He cuts open the wolf's stomach, and the girl steps out alive.
I'd keep away from him.
The new man. I'd keep away from him, if I were you.
You don't want to know, but he's damaged goods -- real damaged goods, if you know what I mean.
You said you couldn't make the sound of a solitary vireo. But you did. Beautifully. I heard you.
How do you feel about that?
You have no feelings for your niece?
Then why are you talking about this?
What are you afraid will happen?
Have you talked to Carlos about your concerns?
Do you think you're crazy?
Why do you think you're here?
Is that what you are angry about?
Who do you see?
What?
Is that a school?
Doesn't it get noisy?
My place faces a truck street. I've got cracks in every window from the shaking.
Did I say something wrong?
Is that all?
You don't molest little girls anymore, do you?
You're scared.
Neither am I.
What's going on?
How you guys doing?
Okay, Jammer.  No problem.  You stay right here. I have to go there to the end... you'll see my lights.  We'll stay in voice contact.  Just hold onto the rope.  Five more minutes.  Okay?
What are you still wearing that for?
Jesus, Lindsey--
Look.  I'm just trying to hold this situation together.  I can't allow you to cause this kind of hysteria--
You owe me one, Virgil.
Okay... okay.  We gotta get you out of here.
I don't know how!
I know!  I know!  But we better come up with something.
We'll take reading as we go.  If the reactor's breached or the warheads have released radioactive debris, we'll back away.  Simple.
Come on, man.  What else could it be?
Cat, you tie onto this manifold.  There's some tanks on the other side; I'm gonna go check them out.
SHIT!
Deepcore, Deepcore... this is Cab Three on final approach.
Fluid breathing system.  We just got them.  We use it if we need to go really deep.
What kind of light?
Did you sleep well?
These people are contemptible. They have no sense of dignity at all.
It couldn't have come from anywhere else. At least, somewhere from that vicinity... But I really can't understand it. Contraband cigarettes on that island! It's the first time that ever happened.
But how could we...at a time like this when we just... well, let's at least first have a look around the other islands. Could be that something might turn up there.
There's nothing much to laugh at.
Where are you going?... To Montaldo's?
Really, I've got to stop this business with Ettore... I would like to go back and start working on my own projects again. You know, I had many ideas...
What are you saying?
I'm going with the patrol boat to make a tour around the islands.
I just can't leave without first searching those islands, one by one.
Who are you talking to?
I'll stay here also.
And who is this?
Don't you ever paint men?
But why me?... Ask Claudia, she's much more beautiful than me.
Are you the owner of this place?
But where did you come from?
Raimondo... Do you enjoy fishing underwater?
Because I'm getting fat.
I am, there's too much flesh on me.
I'm a blimp.
Because...
I do, I have to be attractive to God.
No he doesn't. He hates fat people.
It's a sin to be fat.
Look at the statues, they're thin.
That's because they're suffering... suffering is beautiful, I want to be beautiful.
Christ said it in the Bible, he said - suffer the little children, I want to suffer like a little child.
I... I am a little child but my body keeps getting bigger and soon I... I won't be able to fit in, I... I won't be able to squeeze into Heaven.
You want to talk about the baby don't you?
I never saw any baby... I think they made it up.
I don't know.
No. I was sick.
Something I ate.
Yes.
Down... there.
I went to my room.
I got sicker.
I fell asleep.
Yes.
What baby?
From their heads...
No, they say it came from the waste paper basket!
From God.
I... I don't understand.
Don't you know?
I don't understand what you're talking about... you want to talk about the baby... everybody wants to talk about the baby but... I never saw the baby so I can't talk about the baby because... I don't believe in the baby.
No... no, I'm tired of talking, I've been talking for weeks, nobody believes me when I tell them anything... nobody listens to me.
No... no, I don't want to answer any more questions.
What do you mean?
Anything?
Agnes, I'm here because I want to help you.
But you're troubled... aren't you?
And you're unhappy.
Agnes...
Sometimes, yes.
Which one?
Of what?
Why isn't anyone coming?
It was dead.
Martha, it's you.
I'm afraid the word brings up the most unpleasant connatations in this day and age...
You can call me Sister.
It's my affair too.
And my permission?
Stop this, she'll hurt herself  I'm not going to allow this.
They're yours.
Sure.
Are you going in?
You never know, you might be lucky this time.
Aye and we'll have to watch it and all.
Oh, Paul, you can't have your own way!!!
Hello, he's not talking to me. He's having a sulk.
Will you ever look at him, sitting there wid his hooter scraping away at that book!
Have you no natural resources of your own? Have they even robbed you of that?
Can you now? Aah ... sheeps' heads! You learn more by getting out there and living.
Any old where ... but not our little Richard ... oh no! When you're not thumping them pagan skins, you're tormenting your eyes wid that rubbish!
Parading's better!
That's it, parading the streets ... trailing your coat ... bowling along ... living!
You're living, are you? When was the last time you gave a girl a pink-edged daisy? When did you last embarrass a sheila wid your cool appraising stare?
At least I've a backlog of memories, but all you've got is that book!
So you <U>are</U> a man after all.
Do you think I haven't noticed ... do you think I wasn't aware of the drift? Oh ... you poor unfortunate scuff, they've driven you into books by their cruel, unnatural treatment, exploiting your good nature.
And that lot's never happier than when they're jeering at you ... and where would they be without the steady support of your drum beat, I'd like to know.
And what's it all come to in the end?
A book!
Come on let's get this coffee.
And another thing, where's that old mixer?
Aye, that's what I'm afraid of!
What's he know?
I'll brook no denial!
Control yourself or you'll spurt. He's bound to be somewhere.
And?
I knew it, <U>he</U> started it, I should have known.
Stop picking on him.
How's that?
So you just brought the old chap out of the crowd for his own good.
Where's Irth?
I'm sending.  Do you hear me?
Okay, I'm in the mouth of the chimney now, and I'm starting down.
Just <u>hold it</u>, <u>hold it</u>!  Computer: have you attempted to analyze the transmission?
Yes?  What is it?
Why, what's wrong?
What do you mean?
Oh -- God -- oh --
This dust is getting clogged in the intakes again!
He wouldn't open the lock; he was going to leave us out there.
That thing, God almighty, didn't you try to get it off him?
Maybe we don't have to.  It's trapped in there.  We could just leave it in there all the way back to Irth.
It will be.
Look at that.
It's some kind of organ -- it's inserted some kind of tube or something down his throat.
We can't kill it on board.  It's huge now and must have tremendous amounts of that acid in its body.
Well, we can't go anywhere in this darkness.  How long till dawn?
If we don't hear from him soon, I think we better go in after him.
Too primitive.  It's a pre- technological construction.  That slab was engineered by an Iron-Age culture at best.
My God, it's stormy for a piece of rock that size!
Oh my God.
What would you say that was supposed to mean?
Where did the parasites come from?
Hey, wait a minute!  That's all our food supplies in there!  We can't pump poison gas all over them!
This is all the same creature.  We're seeing the different stages in its life-cycle.
So what do we do?  Do we ignore it and finish loading the explosives into the boat -- or do we flush it out now?
Nada. No radiation... no movement... nothing.
Can you patch me a temporary loop on DCMGS?
Fucking great.  I invested some money in them.
I lose 'em all, that's why I'm still out here on this rock.  Anything else you wanna ruin my day with?
How much air-time have I got?
Deal.
What?  Are you nuts?  Just the two of us?
Forget it, man.
Oh, man.  That's no glitch!
Is it still moving?
We had to.  They were just too cumbersome for some of the conduits you're gonna have to negotiate.  Besides, all the crap floating around reduces visibility to the extent where I doubt having helmet lights would have make that much difference, anyway.  Maintenance lights down there oughta be enough to do the trick.
They knocked out the external feeds.
I've got a lot of thinking to do.  'Sides, the room was getting too crowded for me.
Do you believe him?
Today's party's finished their sweep, the relief team's out there now. Everybody else is either asleep or running shift in the auto-shop.
Nah, I'll stick it out for another hour or so.
'Bout five minutes.
What a day - what a heavenly day...
Just like it.
Stop rehearsing your column... Isn't it strange, Addison? I thought I'd be panic-stricken, want to run away or something. Instead, I can't wait for tonight to come. To come and go...
Aren't you?
What do you take me for?
It is possible - even conceivable - that you've confused me with that gang of backward children you've been playing tricks on - that you have the same contempt for me that you have for them?
Look closely, Eve, it's time you did. I am Addison deWitt. I'm nobody's fool. Least of all - yours.
I don't suppose there's a drink left...
I don't think I'm going.
Because I don't want to.
No, it's not.  It's for this.
Exactly.  Here. Take it to the party instead of me.
It is senseless to insist that theatrical folk in New York, Hollywood and London are no different from the good people of Des Moines, Chillicothe and Liverpool. By and large, we are concentrated gatherings of neurotics, egomaniacs, emotional misfits, and precocious children-
Why so remote, Addison? I should think you'd be at the side of your protegee, lending her moral support...
The ladies' - shall we say - lounge?
I guess at this point I'm what the French call 'de trop'...
Knit me a muffler.
I can't believe you're making this up - it sounds like something out of an old Clyde Fitch play...
I've always denied the legend that you were in 'Our American Cousin' the night Lincoln was shot...
Of course it's funny - this is all too laughable to be anything else. You know what I think about this - this age obsession of yours - and now this ridiculous attempt to whip yourself up into a jealous froth because I spent ten minutes with a stage-struck kid-
Thirty minutes, forty minutes! What of it?
Now how can you take offense at a kid trying in every way to be as much like her ideal as possible!
For instance what?
This is my cue to take you in my arms and reassure you - but I'm not going to. I'm too mad-
Mad! Darling, there are certain characteristics for which you are famous - on stage and off. I love you for some of them - and in spite of others. I haven't let those become too important to me. They're part of your equipment for getting along in what is laughably called out environment - you've got to keep your teeth sharp. All right. But you will not sharpen them on me - or on Eve...
She hasn't cut them yet, and you know it! So when you start judging an idealistic dreamy-eyed kid by the barroom, Benzedrine standards of this megalomaniac society - I won't have it! Eve Harrington has never by word, look, thought or suggestion indicated anything to me but her adoration for you and her happiness at our being in love! And to intimate anything else doesn't spell jealousy to me - it spells a paranoic insecurity that you should be ashamed of!
Bill...  ... where are you going? To find Eve?
Hello, what's your name?
Lemme fix you a drink.
She, too, is a great admirer of yours.
You're going to Hollywood - aren't you?  From the trunks you're packing, you must be going to stay a long time.
If I only knew how...
Karen...  ... you won't forget, will you? What we talked about before?
Addison wants me to play it.
Back to Copacabana. But Eve. Margo, let me tell you about Eve-
Well - what do you think of my elegant new suit?
I can imagine... you know, all it needed was some taking in here and letting out there - are you sure you won't want it yourself?
Oh, come now, as though you were an old lady... I'm on my way. Is there anything more you've thought of-?
I've got it.
Right here.
That's my job.  See you at tea time...
Oh, golly. And I forgot to tell you-
Well, I was sure you'd want to, of course, being his birthday, and you've been so busy these past few days, and last night I meant to tell you before you went out with the Richards - and I guess I was asleep when you got home...
Relax, kid. It's only me and my big mouth...
Ain't it the truth?
Autograph fiends! They're not people - those little beast who run in packs like coyotes-
Karen.  I haven't been pleasant this weekend.
Come to think of it, I haven't been very pleasant for weeks. For that, I'm truly sorry. More than any two people I know, I don't want you and Lloyd to be angry with me...
So many people - know me. I wish I did. I wish someone would tell be about me...
How was the concert?
You'll break your neck on that ice.
After all, maybe she just wants to apologize...
I like that girl. That quality of quiet graciousness...
Karen and I just don't want an accident-
Make it Bergdorf Goodman... and now everything is on its proper shelf, eh, Max? Done up in little ribbons. I could die right now and nobody'd be confused. How about you, Max?
Carl?
See her?  Get anything?
And?--And?--
Were you eyebrow reading?
How do you want to handle Sloan?
He's another Ivy Leaguer so he'll probably expect you to be understanding--might surprise him if you're not.
You think we're being set up?--Christ, Deep Throat tells you last night that the letter came from inside the White House and up traipses Marilyn naming names.
You think this was Clawsen's initiation?
I finally got through to Sloan--it was all a misunderstanding that we had: he would have told the Grand Jury about Haldeman, he was ready to, only nobody on the Grand Jury asked him the goddamn question.
Donald Segretti?
Speak.
Hey... very tense.
Five hundred; six maybe.
I think.
Why couldn't you have just dialed me from the office, Irwin?
So tell me about the Times article.
No games, Irwin; give.
Something maybe big.
Just tell me about the goddamn article.
Who by?
--if we wrote a story that said Haldeman controlled the fund?--
Just tell me his title.
What I don't understand is how you got here.
Probably you're right, but a little while ago, I was talking to a couple of lawyers who'd been assigned to represent the burglars.
Why did they do all this for Chrissakes?--what were they after?
Talk about Segretti--
There were more then.
--the Canuck letter--was that a White House operation--
How grand?
And Justice and FBI know all this?
Fifty ratfuckers directed by the White House to destroy the Democrats?
Where's that cheery face we've come to know and love?
As usual, that keen mind of yours has pegged the situation perfectly.  Except  it wasn't local Democratic Headquarters, it was National Democratic Headquarters--  --and  these weren't just any idiots, these were special idiots, seeing as when they were arrested at 2:30 this morning, they were all wearing business suits and Playtex gloves and were carrying--  --a walkie-talkie, forty rolls of film, cameras, lock picks, pen-sized tear gas guns, plus various bugging devices.  Not to mention over two thousand dollars, mostly in sequenced hundred dollar bills.
I can predict the next words you're gonna say: "anyone but Bernstein."  I want to send a reporter to Miami.
Howard--
That was awhile ago.
--and he says Chapin hired Segretti--
Hi. I'm Bob Woodward of the Washington Post and I hate to bother you at home--
No, I'm a reporter. I wanted to talk to you about the Committee to Re- Elect.
You work there, Miss Abbott.
Perhaps you should consider actually answering an ad.
This.  Right now.
Hey, what're you doing here?
...I've got this lacrosse game.  It's really important, it's our last game. And you know, Central almost beat us last time, so I really want to kick their ass, and it's like cool because we're gonna get to play at State, which means that after the game I might be able to stop by...
I'm sorry, I totally spaced.  I just...I didn't realize it...
Ah, you'll get her back soon enough. That's easy, she likes you.  What you need to do is learn to press a girl's buttons.  You gotta give her what she's never had.
I'll give you a hint.  "Ohhh, yeah, yeah!"  Comprende?
You got it, stud.
No you haven't.
No.
Do you?
Unlisted age, plus "youthful mind," equals old.
Hey, where's Finch?
Yeeeeeeeaaaawwwwww!
Jim?
...excuse me?!
Hey, you did better than I did, Nova.
Yes.
Jim...
Oh, Kev.
Tonight?
Kevin?  Do you not love me?
But you don't love me.
Yeah Vick?
Then she said -- she loves me.
So does your tongue cramp up?
NOVA!!
Here, babe.
Merde! I can't believe this!
Okay... dead or undead... what do you want from me?
I'm serious. There's nothing for you down there. It's dangerous.
What about food? Even beautiful women have to eat. It's true. I read it. Please? A half an hour?  My treat?  Pleez! Don't make go out there alone again! I'm begging you!
You two faced bastard. I knew you were full of shit.
Andy?... What? What is it?  Andy... are you okay?
No I.... Andy, you can't be sure.
Whoa...
Pretty stylish digs for a bunch of paupers.
In Paris we have an expression for people like you: Encul d'Americain.
You bastard! God! I should've known. You wanted the cure all for yourself!
Psychic awareness. Right.
What?
All my life I've worked to unlock the power of the unconscious mind. Well this is it. This is power!
Maybe we should go now. You must be very tired. We'll call if any new -
Andy, stop! I think he can help you - 
Saint Severin...
You think that's what McDermott was raving about in the ambulance?
Providing travel papers is illeagal!  I know Dmitri well - perhaps I can help you.  Providded you have enough money to pay for this service. . .
Ouch!  That really hurt!
Forged papers! Now, what?!
Nervous?
Anastasia! It was just a bat! It's gone, dear...
Hey, she's just a kid. And she's going to Paris outta sight, outta mind, outta Russia.
She doesn't want to do anything "dishonest". . .
Life is funny, isn't it. You find the right girl ... and then you lose her.
Empress, no! I will not take the money! I just came to tell you I was sorry...
Who's on television?
H'm, I'm sorry, I can't go through with this, because it-I can't get it off my mind, Allison... it's obsessing me!
Stop it, Alvy!
So, so-well, here's what I wanna know. W-what...  Am I your first big romance?
Well, then, w-who was?
All right.
Yeah... so, listen-you drive?
Oh, you do?
Oh, right.
Huh?
Well, I don't know. I mean, I guess- I guess you must be sorta late, huh?
Me? Oh, uh.  No.
Oh... nothing. Not-no, no!
I know.
Well, I mean, I meet a lot of... jerks, you know-
what I mean?
But I'm thinking about getting some cats, you know, and then they... Oh, wait a second-oh, no, no, I mean  oh, shoot! No, Saturday night I'm gonna-  gonna sing. Yeah.
Oh, no-I mean, I'm just a-auditioning sort of at club. I don't-
it's my first time.
Yeah.
You see, like you and I...
No, I'm not.
Well, what does-what does that mean? I don't know what that is.
Oh, you have my body.
Well, I need grass and so do you.
M'hm.
Were you always funny?
What's- It's me, open up.
Are you okay?  What's the matter?  Are you all right? What-
What?
That's what you got me here for at three o'clock in the morning, 'cause there's a spider in the bathroom?
Oooh.
Kill it! For Go- What's wrong with you? Don't you have a can of Raid in the house?
-me, my God, it's a great day!
You never wanna try anything new, Alvy.
That's sick!
Oh, good. Okay.
I tell you this because, as an artist, I think you'll understand. Sometimes when I'm driving... on the road at night... I see two headlights coming toward me. Fast. I have this sudden impulse to turn the wheel quickly, head-on into the oncoming car. I can anticipate the explosion.  The sound of shattering glass. The... flames rising out of the flowing gasoline.
Hey, come on, it's quiet now. We can- we can start again.
What-
Oh, you got a headache!
Bad?
Thank you very much. It's a pleasure.
Yeah, watch the road!
I think he has a little thing for Annie.
You fired the cleaning woman?
But she's colored.
So the colored have enough trouble.
They're persecuted enough!
Oh, he's adorable, Annie.
Tessie, they say you were the sister with personality.
Uh, how did this personality come about?
There were many men interested in you?
Poor Mac.  It's been a bit of a struggle. I'm sure Sally's told you.
The movie.
I don't know what's going on.  I don't care to guess.  Mac's really unhappy. She isn't there, that's all.  She's no idea what she's playing, not a clue.
And, you know it isn't rocket science, this script.  She can barely get the lines out.  There was a scene last week - she sobbed, through every take.  I know crying's easy for her but it's a fucking comedy, Joe.  Something's gone.  You know, that thing that was Sally - that always surprised you.  It's gone.  I think she's scared.  And that's death.
Mac's a pretty great director, Joe.  He's a woman's director.  And nothing's happening.  Course he won't fire her, because of the friendship... But it was discussed.  He had to battle his studio to get her in the first place.
Hey, listen, I love her.  She's Sophia's best friend.  I never said any of this, alright.  I'll deny it on the stand...  You guys are gonna have kids.  That is so great.  Maybe that's what this is all about.  Maybe she doesn't want to do this anymore.  You know adults don't do this for a living.  You guys are gonna have your kids, you'll be directing -- one asshole in the family is enough.  Sophia knew that intuitively.  Look at Clair. Clair's a mess.  Make sure she gets the epidural.  Forget that natural childbirth shit. Everything's going to be what it's supposed to be.  "Life is but a walking shadow.  A poor player who struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more..." And speaking of me, the role of Leo in your film?
Any thoughts on casting yet?
Well, I can't make any promises, and of course I haven't read the script but I loved the novel...when are you shooting?
I have a small window of time.
Scratch the two, write in a four.
You've got a lot of fucking gall.  Thirty nine.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
That for us?
Can I open it?
I know we're early, we're so early. Sorry.
We closed.
I love you.  Most beautiful woman in the world.
Accept a compliment.
Otis!  No barking!
Someone left the goddamn gate open.  Otis got out.  Skye and I, well the... I came out of the house and the fucking gate was wide open.
Happy anniversary.
I know.
I know.  It's for the baby's crib.
You got your DP?
And you got Skye Davidson.  Pretty big leagues for a first timer.  Do you even like movies?
Kind of.  Hey, look - John Seale, Oliver Stapelton, Darius Khonji - they're friends.  And great DP's I could give them a call for you.
Hey, I'm happy for you, buddy.  Anything I can do.
I've never done this before.
I'm a little in the puke zone.
What am I, five?
I was faking it.  I've been feeling caged for sometime.  Funny, huh?
Hi.  Monica and Ryan?
Good, you brought your violin.  I want you to play.
Are you lovesick?
Will champagne help?
What did I do?
Enough about me.
Hey, slow it down, big boy.  You're making the rest of us look bad...How come I haven't seen you around here before?
Tell me about it.
So uh -- how come I haven't seen you around here before?
The palace, hunh?  I bet those royals really live it up.  Of course they're all a little, you know, from inbreeding --
What <u>was</u> that thing?
I order you to find out where we are!
Out here I'm just what?
Z!  what are you doing?
Well, what exactly does our platoon do?  Serve beverages?  Process paperwork?
Notice the big one, holding hands with the female?
Well I, I don't think "living it up" is the right term -- how about "working themselves to death"?
Ask me why we're so successful.
Wear this.
Yeah, I know.
You wouldn't have such a thing as a napkin, would you?
Beatnik! Go to my kitchen -- third drawer, under the good silver, there is napkins.
Good night.
Guess I made a boo-boo, huh?
Really? You mean you wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with somebody in a hat like this?
Maybe if I wore it a little more to the side --  is that better?
Well, as long as you wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with me -- how about the three of us going out this evening -- you and me and the bowler -- stroll down Fifth Avenue -- sort of break it in --
I understand. Christmas -- family and all that --
Oh, you don't have to worry about that. I have quite a bit of influence in Personnel. You know Mr. Sheldrake?
Here. How about some breakfast?
I just have this talent for falling in love with the wrong guy in the wrong place at the wrong time. BUD  How many guys were there?
Cut.
Too slow?
You better win a hand -- you're on a blitz.
Mr. Sheldrake? Oh, yes. Very.
I'm sure that's the explanation.
No doubt about it.
What for?
You are?
I know how you feel, Miss Kubelik. You think it's the end of the world -- but it's not, really. I went through exactly the same thing myself.
Well, maybe not exactly -- I tried to do it with a gun.
Worse than that -- she was the wife of my best friend -- and I was mad for her. But I knew it was hopeless -- so I decided to end it all. I went to a pawnshop and bought a forty-five automatic and drove up to Eden Park -- do you know Cincinnati?
Anyway, I parked the car and loaded the gun -- well, you read in the papers all the time that people shoot themselves, but believe me, it's not that easy -- I mean, how do you do it? -- here, or here, or here --  -- you know where I finally shot myself?
Here.
Uh-huh. While I was sitting there, trying to make my mind up, a cop stuck his head in the car, because I was illegally parked -- so I started to hide the gun under the seat and it went off -- pow!
Yeah. Took me a year before I could bend my knee -- but I got over the girl in three weeks. She still lives in Cincinnati, has four kids, gained twenty pounds -- she sends me a fruit cake every Christmas.
Are you all right?
Are you sure? How's your knee?
Mind if I come in?
Tell me, Baxter -- just what is it that makes you so popular?
I like the way you handled that. Well, how does it feel to be an executive?
Well -- I guess so.
Oh, yes. Very attractive. Is she -- the lucky one?
Say, Baxter -- you gave me the wrong key.
But this is the key to the executive washroom.
Hello? Yeah, Baxter. What's up?
Oh, Buddy-boy. I was just about to call you.  I'm sorry about that mess on the living room wall. You see, my little friend, she kept insisting Picasso was a bum -- so she started to do that mural -- but I'm sure it will wash off -- just eyebrow pencil.
I did, didn't I? I distinctly remember bending over and putting it there --
It is?  Well, how about that? No wonder I couldn't get into the executive washroom this morning.
That's a shame. I'll send the key right down. And about your promotion --  -- I'm sending that efficiency report right up to Mr. Sheldrake, in Personnel. I wouldn't be surprised if you heard from him before the day is over.
What are you going to do, Doc?
Say, Baxter -- we're having a little party and we ran out of ice -- so I was wondering --
How come you're alone on New Year's Eve?
What's this -- you packing?
Say, what's going on here, anyway?
What's with you, Fran -- did you forget where you live?
Where are we going, Jeff? Not back to that leaky boat --
Some setup you got here.  A real, honest-to-goodness love nest.
We need all our fuel anyway.
Were you Longe Range Recon --
I know it sounds stupid, but I feel like the goddamn jungle's watching us.
Whatdoya think it thinks.
You forgot the mangoes, didn't you?
Careful,  Captain, they've been known to charge.
Why -- Charlie put it there to kill --
What do you want ?
Who is he?
We don't want to bother you any, we --
Good swell.
This is Baker Delta Four -- Captain hit bad -- need dust-off. Receiving heavy automatic weapons fire from huts about thirty yards to our left.
It's gonna blow this place out. It's gonna ruin it ...
How did we get here?
I think think a lie stinks.
This one , Lance?
This boat's a mess.
Oh, you don't talk to Colonel Kurtz.  You listen to him. God, these are good. I kept these people off you, you know. It wasn't easy.
Simple. They don't want him to go.
Pre-Australian, actually. But I'd dig goin' to California. I'm California dreamin'.
I'm afraid I won't have time -- I gotta --
23   CONTINUED:
What makes you so sure my boys won't be waiting for us?
...I won't let a killer walk!
39   CONTINUED:
Stay here.
Let's go.
Go ahead.  Take the jeep.  I'll come to Cache with Bob when he gets here.
Sounds like professional jealousy.
Have to backtrack, find another way down.
I'm hungry.  Go kill me some dinner.
Maybe you can talk sense into your boyfriend.
Christ if I shouldn't know better than to step in soft earth.  I've seen footprints in the tundra a hundred years old.
Look, Mr. Desmond, I didn't count on it turning this ugly.
Bastards killed Sam, you think they won't kill the rest of us?
Wilder's missing church services; you believe it?
Look, we pull Ben's ass out of the fire, I'll get you a whole damn crate of Snickers bars.
I didn't know you had a secret admire.
He's good...  And I'm an expert on doctors.
Clippity clop -- clippity clop -- she has to pretend she doesn't hear me. Listening to the story from the upset friend...  now she drops off the cappuccino and smiles at the putzette who doesn't even say, "Thank you." No, the putzette wanted the whipped cream so back she goes and now she has to pass him again and it's getting tougher to make believe.
Sorry, honey...  I'll be right there.
No... no thank you notes.
Lovely.
... my father didn't leave his room for 11 years -- he hit my hand with a yardstick if I made a mistake on the piano.
I am so afraid you're about to say something awful...
Here are the keys to my apartment. I'm going to park you in my place while I take Carol home.
I'll take you... why not?
I don't know the last time I've been out of the city... Hey, my arms are tanning. I used to tan great. We gotta stop soon so'se I can check on Spencer.
I love you...  Let him take you home.
Definitely a package you don't want to open or touch.
Okay... so I'll see you tomorrow. Let's not drag this out. We don't enjoy another that much.
Is he dead yet?
Absolutely.
Sure thing.
That's some face they left hanging on you. You look like...
I, uh... I was... attacked. Walked in on people robbing me. I was hospitalized. I almost died.
I think you gotta camp it here...
So you're practically finished, huh?
Boy, that's fucking genius.  You're a fucking genius.  Then you're just sitting there, bullshitting with me. Man, no way I coulda done that!
How'd you know?  Just tell me that. How'd you fucking know?
What does that fucking mean?
Hi.  Up ahead my boss is in that black limo.  We're not sure which hotel we're at, so could you just follow them?
Who is the mark?
Nikita?  She helped me find you.
Took a guess.  Lucky for you, I guessed right.
I work for the government.
Don't tell me I don't have a choice!
I'm two seconds away from making my choice which means you've got two seconds to tell me why I shouldn't shoot you.
I don't need you to get the money -- my money!
I killed him.
Because that's how it works.  That's what it's about.  He was the best. He was on top.
Yes.  As soon as you get into this business, all you can think about is getting to the top.  That's all there is.  Until then, there is nothing.  You are nothing.
The same way everyone does; the government, the Agency.
More or less.
They recruited me when I was in high school.
Languages.  I was already fluent in nine languages.
Some people said that.  I never thought so.
I was just different.
No.  I graduated from George Washington University.  Then I entered the Agency training program.
No, they didn't.
Of course.  I was going to be James Bond.
They are very good at what they do. It's very seductive.  The training, the weapons, the travel --
Women?  No... not really.
Women... I don't... I don't want to talk about women.
Because you are a women.
The same reason everyone does.  You hear your name on C-SPAN and you realize you're a skeleton in someone's closet and they're coming to bury you.
Yes.  It didn't matter much to them as long as I disappeared.
The only thing different about the private sector is that a General Contractor takes less of a percentage than the government, so you make more money.  Then once you make the transition, you realize you were never working for the government; it was always the private sector, the vested interests and it's the same vested interests that continue to buy your plane tickets.
My first take?
Why?
It was... mechanical.  Very precise. It was exactly like the training drill except for the adrenaline.
No.  Just the first one.
They become complicated... messy.
Did it ever bother James Bond?
This is fiction!  Don't you see that?  This is another reality.  And the people that come into the world to play this game -- nobody forces them!  They're here, they know the rules, the stakes, the risks!  Do you understand what I am saying?  No one is innocent -- including you!
I'm kind of tired.  I think I'd like to try and get some sleep.
You'll be here.  A restaurant.  A public place far enough away that he won't notice you, but with a good enough view you'll be able to see him when he moves inside.
Then, we wait.
Can I ask you something?
I prefer it like this.
Thank you.
Excellent, senor.  If you could follow me?
Of course, senor.
Inspirations a fickle thing, you don't realise you had it till it's gone.
What we need is a space for real performance art. A cultural exchange for radical expressionism.
I feel like a mole in this joint, so I guess I might as well come out lookin' like one!
I'd love to get in there.
It must be fair old size, suppose it's empty?
No way, it's sealed - if she's in there she's dead.
Like a hand?
Thanks. Come on Chris, give me a hand.
You know, there is one thing I can't figure out. All along they've been bugging me about those files and when I told them I'd burned all that stuff, they went nuts - they told the Consul guy they were medical records?
Well, it seems they've dropped any charge relating to the files.
Maybe, but I've started to wonder what those files were all about. Suppose it was old KGB stuff and had the dirt on big people or maybe the personnel records of the secret police, that might explain all the hassle and the cover-up.
It was all in Czech wasn't it.
Yeah, somewhere?
Do you want me to see what's on them?
And if you're wrong.
What do you want me to do?
Yeah, Dave Walters.
You mean, Josh's father had nothing to do with it?
You're sure?
I'd like to talk with you about doing some performance poetry here....A weekly thing.
We should be done by the weekend.
I could pencil you in if you like?
Don't give me this Kat, I'm doing it for you and your country.
I want you so bad. She'll be asleep soon, maybe we could do it quietly under the sheets.
Forget about me Kat.
Yes, it's looks good.....We will use this for the soundtrack and we will have two guys up there with the spotlights. The others will just be house lights.
About forty minutes.
No act of love but willing violence demanded by one and begged by the other. As life turned to fantasy and reality to ecstasy a need, so deep no light could reach, surfaced like a nocturnal creature unearthed for momentary and glorious display. Left alone in a rose-tinted afterglow dimming fast she tasted the moisture of her body and wondered why light came to day and such desires to her pale-skin body.
It's all my fault, I'm so sorry Doug.
Why did you break into that particular building?
What was the real purpose behind this venture?
That's okay I like the metro, it's only a couple of stops from here.
Yeah, so I hear. Don't you think you should go get changed?
You are responsible...What has happened?
She asleep?
Honey, some of this is... farfetched. You take after me. People skills and common sense. Good dependable qualities.
You do. You're handsome and charming.
That's eight years of school and training -- after college. And all that doesn't necessarily make you a better human being.
Hypotheticals --
I'm very sorry --
Yeah.
No problem --
You're really into God, right?
Yeah.
But you think about Him -- It -- Her.
You were great the other night.
She great or what?
Stand right here.
How do you know this place?
Can you locate XXI5639I?
Help me live until I die?
How're you doing?
I'm asking how much.
Landon. You're not the quiet type.
So talk to us about something.
You're marrying again.
For Jefferson High. For books.
It's mine to give. I didn't steal it.
I've been calling you for five minutes! Didn't you hear me?
What time does school start around here?
Is that what you were going to ask me, George? To go to the dance?
What is that? A pencil that writes in ink?
Yeah, explode it up your ass!
Okay, Martin. You have a good evening now.
The plutonium! That's what I came over here for! Professor, where did you get that stuff?
Well, there's a mall here now -- I mean, there will be.
Let me put it on a level you can understand. You don't belong here. You don't know anything about this world. You don't know the customs, you don't know how to talk, how to act -- you don't even look like you belong here. And if you walked out on the street, you wouldn't get 100 yards without being arrested. Then there would be questions, and where would we come up with the answers?
Look. I'm a little worried about this -- this whole thing with my mother, he admitted to the Professor. I mean, I don't know if I can do it -- I mean, hitting on my own mother, that's pretty heavy.
That's exactly what I said! I mean, a guy and his mother -- that's illegal, isn't it?
That's just what I needed to hear.
Obviously!  
What theater was I at?
Nah, skip that... I'm going to have to keep an eye on you, though.
What'd they look like?
Sure is pretty.
You still in school?
Doing what?
Somebody else is going to get it.
"The Kon-Tiki in motion was a little different from what it usually was in such conditions. We had become sensitive to changes in the rhythm of the logs. I thought at once of suction from the coast, which was drawing near, and was continually out on the deck and up the mast..."
Don't.
No.
Yes.
You know... they'd probably ask to see your driver's license before they hired you.
Hi, whatcha doing?
You tossed my hat out the window.
We at the Banzai Institute have at last found that way: an alternating gradient synchronizer that softens solid matter by attenuating its electroweak forces!
What crate?
Planet 10?  The same Planet 10 you postulated beyond Pluto, Perfect Tommy?  The invisible body?
Does this thing have guns, John Parker?
Raise your hand...where?
Somebody get her a mike? Can we manage that?  And a spotlight.  What's your name?
You keep an eye on it.
...hit Smolensk and precipitate a thermonuclear war, Mr. President.
A thermonuclear holocaust, sir.  These creatures from Planet 10 are ready to exploit Soviet-American tensions and get us to blow each other off the face of the earth, sir, if necessary.
It's a spittin' image.
Pictures don't lie.
Is, uh... Is he okay?
Hello, Barton.
Am I? Maybe to a schoolboy's eye. People who know about the human heart, though, mebbe they'd say, Bill over here, he gives his honey love, and she pays him back with pity  the basest coin there is.
Yeah, he's funny that way.
I'll jus' walk on down to the Pacific, and from there I'll... improvise.
We have to talk a little business. I've just been on the phone to Los Angeles.  Barton, Capitol Pictures wants to put you under contract. They've offered you a thousand dollars a week. I think I can get them to go as high as two.
What do you do far a living?
Fair enough. No pressure here, Barton, because I respect you, but let me point out a couple of things. One, here you make a difference to five hundred fifty people a night  if the show sells out.  Eighty five million people go to the pictures every week.
Yes, generally, to see pap. However, point number two: A brief tenure in Hollywood could support you through the writing of any number of plays.
...In spite of what you might think from tonight, I'm pretty good at it.
Hell yes. Because I believe in it. Fire, theft, and casualty are not things that only happen to other people  that's what I tell 'em. Writing doesn't work out, you might want to look into it. Providing for basic human need  a fella could do worse.
What kind of scribbler are you  newspaperman did you say?
Ah, doctors. What's he gonna tell me?  Can't trade my head in for a new one.
It's okay, it's okay.
...I guess it seems pathetic to a guy like you.
Well it's pathetic, isn't it? I mean to a guy from New York.
This kind of heat. It's pathetic.
So they say.
Jesus, Charlie, I...
...Well Bart, which is it? Orphan? Dame?
I'm sorry if I let you down.
...Yeah, he... he lives next door to me.
...I thought you said you were a writer.
Get down on your knees, you sonofabitch!  Get down on your knees and kiss this man's feet!
The boat blew.  There was a leak in the gas line.  There were two previous repairs.  There was a five-mil policy on both of 'em.  A real heavy investigation.  Zilch. Goose-egg.  It was an accident.
What was she like?
Catherine Tramell.
Beth.  I didn't mean what I said. About --
Put your fucking hands up!  Don't move.
What's your new book about?
I'm tired.
Noah was my counselor in my freshman year.  That's probably where I got the idea for the icepick.  For my book. Funny how the subconscious works.  Hazel is my friend.
Yes.  She's helped me understand homicidal impulse.
Aren't you going to thank me?
How's your shoulder?
You won't believe me.
How'd you get in here?
You didn't not see me long enough to miss me.
No.
Did you kill Mr. Boz, Ms. Tramell?
Was she ever a suspect?
What kind of talk?
He had a girlfriend?
Thanks.
No, sir.  You won't.  There's smoke off yonder on the horizon.  They're gonna want your badge.
You all right, pop?  You want me to drive you?
Come on, I'll drive you in this thing.
Maybe it's for old-time's sake.
He ain't that way.  He's got heart.
So what do we do -- nothing?
She's a suspect.
My name is Jean Michel Basquiat. Have you heard of me?
I'm a painter, too.
I wish they'd quit writing this shit about me.
Everybody's paying top dollar for scraps of paper, refrigerator doors  anything with a SAMO tag on it.  The other day, I just wanted a pack of cigarettes, so I did a drawing and sold it for two bucks. A week later this gallery calls me up: "Somebody's offering us the drawing. Should we buy it for five thousand?"
Yeah  I'd do that... You could teach me.
Who is it?
Chill, man! Be cool! This isn't even my apartment!
Bruno spoke to me already. We could talk about it.
It's Andy again.
 In this corner?
You're shattering all my myths.
Your people.
That's not how I meant it.  For all you know, you might just be a flash in the pan! You can never tell.
Do you know what he's saying?
Wow. Congratulations. I hate that asshole.  Thanks for coming. I guess I just wanted to find out how you're 
See you later.
So keep painting.
You're news. I want the scoop. I write it down. When I speak, no one believes me. But when I write it down, people know it's true.  There's never been a black painter in art history that's been considered really important, you know?
So shut up and keep painting..
Man, I was up on him years ago on the IRT.
How could you?  I'm a woman...
I think you're jealous that I'm a genuine freak, and you have to wear a mask!
I'm sure he's wonderful company and all, but ... doesn't the gold- plated bachelor bit get a little ... stale?
Executive Assistant.  Secretary.  Girlfriend?
What went wrong?  Hang on, I think I know ... You kept things from her.
And the truth frightened her?
"Vicki."  Ice-skater, or stewardess?
I'd offer you coffee, but my assistant is using her vacation time.
Are you perchance a registered voter?  I'm also a mayoral prospect.
Ten, nine...
... eight, seven...
Wonder if it's worth my time.
I could teach her my "French flipper" trick...
A platform?  Lemme see ... Stop global warming.  Start global cooling.  Make the world a colder place.  <u>Frigid</u> ...
It's our secret.  Honest.  How can you be so mean to someone so meaningless?
Find my brother Wilfred.  Give him This.  I have duties he must fulfill in my stead.  Only family can be trusted.
I am as well as can be expected.
I'm on break from-
Their new computer sciences division.  How did you know?
This is easy.
... A giant drilling truck burrowing under the city ...
The batcomputer tracks him heading for the Gotham Museum.
Of course.  He's going to steal the giant white diamond.
Remember the victim at the airport. Toxins introduced through the mouth.
Why is she so desperate to kiss us? I'm betting her lips are poison.
And?
I got the diamond.  Quell problemo, Bruce?
My reserves are exhausted.  I must have the gems that power my suit.
Freezy, I'm feeling...hot.
Okay, my hair is brittle, my skin is dry and I don't care.  I'd weather blizzards to have you. You're the most perfect man I've ever known.
What say we turn up the heat?
Forget your frosty femme.  These lips are wet and ready to get frostbite.
The dreams again, sir?
Why do I keep doing this?
Could I let Batman go? For Dick. For me. Could I leave the shadows? Have a life. Friends. Family...
Up here, Al.
Death.  Death. Without taste, sound and all around us.  Because there is no way for me to save them or myself. This is one giant death trap.
Psychiatrists make you nervous?
The infamous Wayne charm. Does it ever shut off?
A lot of what happened is jagged. Pieces missing. I can't really remember. I just get flashes. Usually in my dreams. I'd kind of gotten used to them. At least accepted them....
Okay. I'm outta here.
I really do apologize, Mr. Wayne. His project was terminated this morning...
Yet so bright and chipper and conservative!  It's so you.  And yet so _you_!  Very few people are both a summer _and_ a winter. But you pull it off nicely.
Harvey. You need me. Since you've gotten out of Arkham, you've managed, what? To bungle stealing a safe? Wreck a statue? And, correct me if I'm wrong here, but weren't you outsmarted by an acned acrobat at the circus?
A-14.
You know, we should've sat down and had us a little heart-to-heart. I bet we would have got on famously.
Thank you, Vicki.
"This is Miss Vale." -- That felt redundant.
But it's not fair.  I'm half drunk and you're not even --
God.  You would.  Come on, Bruce.  I just want to get two drinks in you.  As an experiment.
Oh, Bruce. Don't tell me you carry it around with you.
Boss! Jesus! They've --
Okay, a break-in.  Trash the office, make off with the books ... "Industrial espionage."
... Thank you.
No.
You are on drugs.
Are they paying you for all this?
Allie, I know exactly why you're doing this.
Do we know anything about him?
David - are you ever going to learn to say 'no'?
Shut up, Kevin.  Honey, you-re not making sense ...
He's not too bad.  I can live with him.
Oh Jesus.  Oh God.  Oh Jesus God.  Oh Mary Mother of Jesus. Oh Jesus of Nazareth.
What happened?!!!
Look at all this - publicity expenditure ... catering ... all completely fictional ... back as far as June 93 ...
Oh, look, I mean, it's kind of the last thing... I mean, I'd really like to, but... things at home are kind of sensitive, so I couldn't really er ...
David, David, David ...
You've known me five years Elmer. When do you get to calling me David?
Interesting suit.
off the peg?
What a dork. Huh huh.
Uh, huh huh, this is Las Vegas?
Ow, let go, Butt-Head!
Dammit, all they have is shows about water.
Hey Butt-Head, isn't there supposed to be like, water in cactuses?
Uh... Attention, attention! We're looking for that chick with the big boobs.
Yeah, heh heh. Boooooiiiing!!!
Yeah, heh heh. I think I just had an accident. Heh heh hmm heh hmm heh.
...Two...
Okay, boys and girls, our suspects are on a tour bus we believe to be headed for...  the White House! Jumpin' Jesus! I want everyone there. Our people. Locals. Orders are shoot to kill. Repeat! Shoot to kill!
One more thing. Mah wife's got this leather satchel. It's black, about this big. I need ya to bring it back. It's real important. Sentimental value... Any questions so far?
She sure does.
Shut up, dumb-ass! You didn't score. I scored with both of them...
We should be flattered that she wants to sell our house.
Cabin fever, hon?
Maybe this is heaven.
Hon... I didn't want to die, but really, this is fine with me.  As long as I never have to wash dishes again.
That's it?  No number, or instructions?
Well, I don't know... We don't get many visitors.
Honey, I think that was a mistake.
But <u>we</u> let him out.
A... Are you the guys who're hiding out in the attic?
We studied all day yesterday. Don't tell me...
Are you available?
You lilly-livered bleeding hearts!
Tell the truth.
Cookie, they are dead, dead, deadski.
No, I mean they've gone. Decamped.  Split.  Vanished.
The happy hunting ground.  Who cares?
Sort of.  High spirit.  Heh heh. Listen, cookie, I've been trapped in this burg for hundreds of years.  All I want is to get out.
You do?  Over here?  On <u>my</u> side?
Well, yes, of course.  It's great over here.  You'll meet all the greats.  James Dean.  Buddy Holly.  'The little things a you say and do... make me want to be with you-a-hoo.'
That's right.  They treat you like scum I bet?
I can't help you from this side, but here's how we do it.  So <u>simple</u>.  Say my name three times. That's all.  I'll be all yours. Then I'll bring you over here in style.
Minor problem.  The rules.  I can't tell it to you.  But... do you know how to play charades?
Otho, you've got to help me get Maxie Dean up here.  I have a deal that could make all of us very comfortable.
He's your cousin.
Where is your mother?
I'll bring the wine... and the business plan.  And Lydia you'll bring the ghosts.
Don't you <u>dare</u>.
Blue-green!  Hydrated chromic oxide!  Remember I'm schooled in chemistry.  I was a hair analyst! Briefly.  Interior design is a <u>science</u>, Delia!  Think of me as Doctor Otho.  And this patient is truly <u>sick</u>!
What's happening to them?
Wait a minute!  What am I worried about?  Otho, you can't even change a tire!
I swear, Chauncey, between you and Benjamin, I've got my hands full...  ... Say, that is coming along, the swelling has gone down considerably...  ... Any pain here?
And you, Benjamin, must be strong and brave for me. Turn over, please.
Do you know Raphael?
Oh. I have a message for him.
A Black man gave me the message.
Did you lose something?
... Chauncey... Last night you mentioned an old man, that died.
Was he a relative? Or an intimate friend?
Oh, I see... Your mentor, perhaps?
... I'm grateful to you, Chauncey... I would have opened to you with a touch, and you know that...  ... But you're so strong - I can trust myself with you. I'm glad, Chauncey - I'm glad that you showed so much restraint...
I know you are, Chauncey...  ... You conquer a woman from within herself, you infuse in her the need and desire and the longing for your love.
I see. Then one more quick question, Mr. Gardiner; since we at the Post would like to, uh - update our profile on you - what exactly is your business?
Yes, Eve. That would be good.
No, Ben.
I could give it some thought, Ben, but my leg is very sore.
Mr. Gardiner, I'm Ronald Stiegler, of Harvard Books.
Mr. Gardiner, my editors and I have been wondering if you'd consider writing a book for us? Something on your political philosophy. What do you say?
Of course, who can nowadays? I have trouble writing a post card to my children! Look, we could give you a six figure advance, provide you with the very best ghostwriter, research assistants, proof readers...
Of course not! No one has the time to read! One glances at things, watches television...
Sure you do! No one reads!... Listen, book publishing isn't exactly a bed of roses these days...
Good day, Mr. Chance.
... Hmmm... Elevator.
Don't we need a leader capable of guiding us through the seasons? The bad as well as the good?
Those trees were very young when I first arrived.
Yes. It has.
Yes. I will.
And look who you brought with!
Oh, I've been just dying to meet you, Mr. Gardiner!
But... Where was this man Gardiner before last week?
I see. Clearly, such interest on their part is of great political significance.
Hmmm... Take this down.  I want this quote included in the Tass coverage; 'Chauncey Gardiner, in an intimate discussion with Ambassador Skrapinov, noted that "Unless the leaders of the opposing political systems move the chairs on which they sit closer to each other, all of their seats will be pulled from under them by rapid social and political changes."'
... There is no longer any margin for inflation, it has gone as far as it can, you've reached your limits on taxation, dependence on foreign energy has reached a crisis, and, from where I see it, Mr. President, the Free Enterprise System has reached the breaking point. We are on the brink of another crash from which recovery might not be possible.
Oh, thank you! Thank you! Thousand times, thank you!
I'll meet you on the turnpike.
You were him last night, weren't you?
And he was with her.
We?
Don't forget me.
Mr. Malkovich, my name is Craig Schwartz. I can explain. We operate a little business her that... simulates, for our clientele, the experience of... being you, actually.
Sure, after a fashion.
You? Why I'm sure it would pale in comparison to the actual experience.
Imagine a room full of women. Nubile, blonde, wet with desire, Schwartz. A harem, if you will. Me in leather. A harness, if you like. I am the object of this desire, and all eyes are on me as I speak. Ladies, I begin. I am the love god, Eros. I intoxicate you. My spunk is to you manna from heaven...
Wife, huh? I'd love to meet her, Craig.
Shall we say dinner on Friday. Just the two of us?  You can come too if you like, Schwartz.
That's the usual?
Craig, I just don't find you attractive. And, Lotte, I'm smitten with you, but only when you're in Malkovich. When I looked into his eyes last night, I could feel you peering out. Behind the stubble and the too-prominent brow and the male pattern baldness, I sensed your feminine longing peering out, and it just slew me.
So that's the story of 7 1/2. Since the rents are considerably lower this floor has been adopted by businesses which for one reason or another are forced to cut corners After all... the overhead is low! Ha ha ha!
Floris, get Guinness on the phone.
Forget it.
Aaaahhhh, the portal!
J.M. Inc. Be all that someone else can be.
I'm sorry, did you just call me "Lotte"?
Shut up!  Sorry, dear, I lost control for a minute.
Why you never go back to Lady Jone's and learn your letters? You liked going there I remember. Seeing the other children. Then all a sudden, you stop.
..I swallowed her blood right along with my mother's milk. She played with me and always came to be with me whenever I needed her. Me and her waited for our daddy. I love her. I do. She never hurt me. I love my mother but I know she killed one of her own, and tender as she is with me, I'm scared of her because of it. All the time, I'm afraid the thing that happened that made it all right to kill her own, could happen again. Whatever it is, it comes from outside this house, outside the yard. So I never leave this house and I watch over the yard so it can't happen again ... I have to keep it away from my sister...I'll protect Beloved...'Cause She's mine...
Your mother all right?
You think I should stop by? Think she'd welcome it?
DON'T LOVE HER TOO MUCH.
Well, who can tell what went on in there? I never even knew who Sethe was or none of her people.
I ain't sure I know that. Baby never laid eyes on her till she showed up here. And how'd she make it and her husband didn't? And where is he? And how she have that baby in the woods by herself? Said a whitewoman help her. Shoot. You believe that? Well, I know what kind of white that was.
Anything white floating around in the woods - if it don't got a shotgun, it's something the Lord tells me I don't want no part of.
Till she showed herself.
I ain't got no friends take a handsaw to their own children.
What run him off? Tell me that!
You?
You didn't tell me that. I thought he already knew.
He knew Baby Suggs?
What the hell you thinking, girl? Strolling in here this late?
What? What? You talking back to me?
Well, enjoy, and perhaps we'll see you again some time, Dude.
Jesus fucking Christ.
What's this?
Don't need it.  We're scattering the ashes.
This is a hundred and eighty dollars.
Almost five!
How come you don't roll on Saturday, Walter?
Are they gonna hurt us, Walter?
I like your style, Dude.
Brother Shamus?  Like an Irish monk?
Jeez.  I miss vinyl.
Well...yeah--
Well yeah...I know that.
Well, no, not exactly.  It's a complicated case, Maude.  Lotta ins. Lotta outs.  And a lotta strands to keep in my head, man.  Lotta strands in old Duder's--
No, the, uh, police chief of Malibu. A real reactionary. . . So your father. . . Oh man, I get it!
Smokey my friend, you're entering a world of pain.
That...fucking...bitch!
We can't do that, Dude.  That fucks up our plan.
Wooden bridge, huh?
The bridge is coming up!  Gimme the ringer, Dude!  Chop-chop!
Walter--
"Our" car, Walter?
Is this your homework, Larry?
Dude, please!. . .  Is this your homework, Larry?
Fuck you.  Fuck the three of you.
What about that shit about Vietnam!
Well sir, it's this rug I have, really tied the room together-
Well they were looking for you, these two guys, they were trying to--
So you know they were trying to piss on your rug--
You mean, did you personally come and pee on my--
Well no, like I said, Woo peed on the rug--
Come on, man, I'm not trying to scam anybody here, I'm just--
Look, let me explain something. I'm not Mr. Lebowski;  you're Mr. Lebowski.  I'm the Dude.  So that's what  you  call me.  That, or Duder. His  Dudeness.  Or El Duderino, if, you know, you're not into the whole brevity thing--
Employed?
Is this a--what day is this?
No, look.  I do mind.  The Dude minds. This will not stand, ya know, this will not stand, man.  I mean, if your wife owes--
We know the briefcase was empty, man.  We know you kept the million bucks yourself.
Yeah, but--
Two years.
I've never seen anything like this.  The Reapers are as different from us as we are from you.  It's almost as if the virus is re-wiring their bodies, creating new, parasitic organs which consume the old ones.
It means "bloodbrother."
Where were you, Whistler?
Put it back in park, Blade.
What's going on?
Nomak?
We're locked in.
The hell are you fiddling with there?
You're wasting your time, already been tried.
Nope.  Back then we did not.
Going on twenty years now.
Going somewhere?
You're too human, Blade.
I can go to the police. I have blood samples back at the hospital. I can show them.
Looks like we hit pay-dirt. This place is crawling with them.  See the valets over there? They're vampires. So is the doorman.
You care about him, don't you?
I never imagined I'd be so happy to see the sun rise --  It's over, isn't it?
Five minutes, not a second more. And I don't want to hear a word about "us".
How do you like that? Right on time.
Consider it a parting gift. Vampire mace -- silver nitrate, essence of garlic.
All right, let's start with the basics -- why do vampires need to drink blood?
Not that I can see.
Shit? This is from "Josh's Blair Witch Mix," man!
Yeah, so?
Jesus.
--or someone--
I want to see something!
The clothes--take 'em off-- I want to see every square inch--
So, I hear you're from New Mexico!
Okay, a blur.
I'm the ebay Boy, remember? I can't exactly afford that kind of equipment.
You're not only an idiot, you're a goddamn <u>child</u>.
Used to be a meat-packing plant. Slaughter on the ground floor-- carcasses schlepped up on this thing for dissection and grinding and--
Cotter?
You think it's possible the tree in the Parr foundation is the same one they tied Elly Kedward to?
That's a "j."
You drive, I'll handle the video, okay?
403 41st Street, kids: home.
Chrissake: why <u>any</u> of this?
--sacred and occult Scotch Tape.
What'd you see?
You gonna be alright?
No big deal. I'm just trying to understand.
I think you closed the bar again. I'll have to go out.
Domini's the only logical explanation.
Good morning, Sheriff's Office.
He's in a meeting. Could I have him--
Could I tell him what it's regarding?
...I mean, I don't know where he is, but he ain't dead.
...He sent me to a psychiatrist to see if he could calm me down some.
Psychiatrist said I was the healthiest person he'd ever met, so Marty fired him.
...I just wanted to let you know that everything was all right. I took care of everything. Now all we have to do is keep our heads.
...You leaving?
He needs a room, Dusty.
Then what'd you come here for?
So, uh... this wouldn't interest you.
...Count it if you want.
...Why?
Frank. Come in.
Jeffrey?
Hello, baby.
Hello, daddy.
GET OUT OF THERE!! GET OUT!! Put your hands up, on your head. GO ON!! Get down on your knees - DO IT!! What are you doing? Who are you? What's your name?. WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
Jeffrey. Jeffrey what?
You tell me!! Let me see that wallet.  Jeffrey Beaumont. What're you doing in my apartment, Jeffrey Beaumont?
What? Are you kidding me? Who sent you here?
Shit. You better tell me something.
An experiment? Hey, I've seen you before.
Tell me what you saw tonight. TELL ME.
The phone. What did you hear on the phone . Tell me. Word for word.
You can hit me, if you want to.
Oh God. Don!!! Why can't I just die.
I can't. I can't. You think you know so much.
Look, snap out of it, will ya?
Shh. I'll tell you.
Who, Dorothy?
Raymond! Where's the fuckin' beer?
No, I want ya to fuck it. Shit, yes. pour the fuckin' beer.
Alright, now tell me. What is it?
You said it was a strange world. and you're the strangest part of it. Are you crazy.she is possibly involved in murder. This gives me the creeps.
It wouldn't hurt to hear the plan, I guess.
Now, how are you going to do that?
What will I say when she comes to the door?
I don't know. it sounds like a good daydream, . but actually doing it is too weird. too dangerous.
Here's to. an interesting experience.
Can I give you a kiss good night?
Okay. okay.
You want to dance?
Really?
NO.
Looks like they've got you strapped in pretty good.
Are you feeling okay?
No.
Well.
Sandy? ...Sandy, please.
Norman Cay is not a person.  He is an island, George.  In the Bahamas.  From what they say, it is free and it's Diego's new home.
Are you sure this guy is cool?
You can't sell this to your friends.
What can I do for you guys?
I know what you want.  But, first of all, are you cops?
Because if you are, you have to tell me. If not, it's entrapment.
Happy Birthday, George.  Mirtha invited me.
Look, I'm sorry about everything.  I feel like an idiot.  You were right.  I did fuck you.  And then Diego fucked me. Cut me out, too.
I lost sight of everything.  Forgot who my friends were.
You?
What type of planes do you have?
How many kilos can we fit in these planes?
Fifteen hundred.  We'll have to stop somewhere to refuel.
Thirty-six hours.  I can't believe it. Everything is gone in thirty-six hours.
Touche.
Nothing.  Todo esta bien.
G-d, son.
What do I think?  I don't want my answer to be influenced by what I want, so I'm going to have to say I don't know.
I want money.
Freedom.
Yeah, maybe.
Sure.
Keep them coming.
Money.
You're like your mother.  You love money.
No, it's good.  You have a family.  It's good if it makes you happy.  It's nice to have nice things.  Are you happy, son?
Don't be stupid, George.  We've got him. We've got him dead to rights.  But like I said, this is top priority so we're handing out free passes on this one. And the first one's got your name on it. Cut your sentence in half, maybe more.
Hello.
Do I know you?
Why are you smiling?
I don't know.  My name is George.
What do you want?
Yeah.  She told me.  You walk her to school.
I haven't seen one dollar from you.  You haven't paid me one cent in child support, alimony.
Yeah?  I better see some money out of it.
Bye, Dad.  See you in the morning, okay?
For instance, something like this?
Ha ha ha.  You are funny.   Really, how much will you be needing?
Listen, Americano, it is very nice to meet you, but maybe we are going too fast.  You take a little and then come back.
Marijuana is illegal in my country, and I believe in yours, as well.  We must be careful.
Are we good?
Colonel Mathieu ... Much has been said lately not only of the successes obtained by the paratroopers, but also of the methods that they have employed ... Can you tell us something about this?
And how many are we?
It's clear. They'll do everything possible to make it fail.
You seem to be very satisfied to have taken me alive ...
That proves that I was wrong. Evidently I credited you with an advantage greater than I should have.
I would have missed it -- but the phone rang and I let it play while I talked.  It looks like blank tape -- but it isn't.  It's been erased without any input signal coming in.
It's very good -- because when the D.A's office saw it they assumed it was the end of the tape, otherwise they would have buried it.
I think I'm going to make your day.
Did you ever see Mr. Marsh use cocaine?
Your Honor, this is a tape from Miss Lawson's answering machine.  I would like to play it now.
Can I go?
Mr. Roston, what was your relationship with Miss Lawson?
How long were you together?
How would you describe your sex life with Miss Lawson?
I know this is a very personal subject, but could you be a little more specific?
What kind of condition are you referring to?
What kind of information?
Dr. Trammel, did you ever speak to Miss Lawson about Mr. Marsh's condition?
Did Mr. Marsh ever tell you that he had spoken to Miss Lawson about his illness?
Did Miss Lawson ever accompany Mr. Marsh inside during his examinations?
Then you have no way of knowing what Mr. Marsh told Miss Lawson were the reasons for his visits?
What happened next?
What happened?
Yes.
I'm gonna go to jail.  I know they're gonna make it look like I did it. They gotta put it on someone.
To show you this.  It's a letter from that lawyer, Koehler.  He wrote it to me the day after I saw him.  He's the one who told me I could get the money if Miss Lawson went to jail.
I want you to know right now that the trial's going to be nasty.  Your sex life is going to be dragged through the mud.  They're going to say that you enticed Marsh -- led him down a dark path.
What do you think?
I'm the photographer.
That's not an answer.
I called you all weekend.  Where were you?
You killed him -- didn't you?
You don't need anybody.
Alright, I'll talk to her
Miss Braslow, I'd like to remind you that you are still under oath.
Is that alright, Frank?
Don't use language like that at the dinner table.
I don't mind waiting.
Well, I can help.
I remember a Mrs. Delaney but Mama told me years ago she died.
Bar across the street.
I found out who Lucy Delaney is.  Remember the Delaneys from Hillcrest Road?
He remarried. Apparently they were having an affair for years. Apparently the first Mrs. Delaney was a bit of a stiff.
I bet mom could've helped her.
Not yet. You want to go?
Madge. Please. Something's happened. I've met someone. I've fallen in love in a way I've never thought could happen my entire life. It's our last day together. I feel like I'm going to die when he leaves. Please. Help me.
This won't take long. I'm shooting tomorrow morning. I just need to do some prep work.
Sure you want to keep those in the house?
I didn't mean that the way it sounded.
My mistake. I apologize.
I thought that's what we were doing -- asking questions.
Take me somewhere.
Right now. Tell me someplace you've been -- someplace on the other side of the world. Anywhere but here.
Yes.
Yes. Tell me about the day you got off the train.
Yes.
Sleep all right?
Good. More coffee?  Robert, I hope you don't mind my asking, but I feel like I should.
It's a Chicago station. I found it the other day.
I don't know. Can we turn it off? I have such a headache.
Oh my God...!
Your father was his best friend.  He loved Jeremiah.  So he must hate him the most of all now.  He'll take his time. But even if it is too late.  If your father is dead.  It's not over.  The door has to be closed.
Oh yeah, I guess this would be that space that was so perfect for a recording studio.
Shit.
That's what?
Clean your mouth, or I will.  Those boys had no business messing down there.  Go places you're not meant to be -- that's what you get.
No?  That mean there's something more left of you than just that hungry spirit? What are you going to do now?  Kill us? Kill us all?
I don't understand it.  You were my Man. Since we was grasshoppas.  I always looked after you.  You had a piece of everything I had.
Told you so.  Alright.  We tried.  Let's go home.
I'm here.
Patrick, he's...
Listen to me, boy.  I didn't work all my life to get out of this neighborhood for you to move right back in!
No one'll ever come here.  Shut it down. Don't worry, the bank'll buy it back. I'll take care of it.
Not your style.  Is it Eddie?  Killing off your customers?
Jimmy Bones?
You haven't?
He was a local legend back in the '70's. There was a song, Stagolee kinda deal: "This is the ballad of Jimmy Bones/Black as night and hard as stone..."
You sure we oughta save him?  Why not just let see how safe his gates and walls keep him when his past comes calling?
Glenlivet, right, Gino?
Caesar!
Caesar, I'm leaving.
Why?  Why would Johnnie do this?
...  maybe three hours.
What do you think we're going to do? We have to find the money.
Once we have the money, then none of this ever happened.
No I didn't.  Not if his body disappears and not if the money is still here.  Then they never showed up.
I saved you.
Fuck, this happened before.  It's this shitty ear.  Born with it.  The batteries wore out in my aid.  I'm sorry.
You can't kill me yet.
Actually, yeah, she was nervous about Gino coming, wanted everything to look right.  You know women, Mick.
Ma'am, you have to open the door.
I should be going.  You can drop the cup off anytime.
You dropped that earring down the drain on purpose, didn't you?
No.
Shelly was skimming from the business. He came to see me yesterday because he was afraid Caesar figured it out. He wanted to run but he wanted me to come with him.
Yes.
You said he washed the money?
Then what?  Exactly.
What?
We want him to come down, to relax, feel in control again.
Jesus, that's beautiful.
If you're this goddamn smart, how did you ever get caught?
Done.  We go now.
She's a gypsy.  If it's a cover, it's a great one.
We're exploring <u>every</u> possibility.  We are in pursuit.  How much more do you want me to tell you?
No.  Pursuit <u>ends</u> when we know exactly where he is.
<u>What did you do to me</u>?
I don't know.
I know you've been trying to kill me.
So now you know.
That's all I get?
I don't think so.
Jason Bourne is dead.
Keep it. 
Well...  I must admit, when my assistant told me you were here I was, really -- I was quite -- I was surprised.
We thought you were gone for good.
Just so you know, if you're gonna burn me on the money, you might as well kill me.  I was supposed to have this car back three days ago.  It's not my car.
I should go.
You stayed there five times in the past six months.  But I didn't have time -- I could only get the bill from the last stay -- you were there for two days.  Some room service -- there's half a dozen phone calls here so that's someth--
xxxxxx
Get in the basement.
What the fuck is he doing?
It doesn't matter now.  We've just got to be the first ones there.  Get everybody up.  I want them all activated.
...Be back.
...ven't you?
And the cost of it all, Deputy Minister? Seven percent of the gross national produce ...
Yes, it's all a bit confusing but, it seems she was killed resisting arrest.
But surely, I mean, perhaps she just happened to live above the Buttles, and ...
Right. Er, you're not going to keep calling her Barbara, are you?
Look, about the Layton woman - maybe she's just trying to help the Buttle family.
Why? Hell, not for any reason ...
Out of kindness.
So what are you going to do about her?
You mean you're going to invite her in so that she can spill the beans inside the department?
Let me try to get to her. I'll deactivate her.
Trust me. You do trust me, don't you?
And you're mine.
Then we'd better keep this business just between the two of us.
They weren't at school with us.
Take her off the list.
Say it was a mistake.
Well, I'd better get out there and try to get to her before security does. Let me borrow her dossier for a while.
Are you alright?
OK. What's in the parcel?
They're gone.
Problem. She doesn't have a bank account.
Sod it, it's broken!
What were we saying?
Whatever happened to you?
Actually, there's someone I want to meet ...
Excuse me, Dawson, can you put me through to Mr Helpmann's office?
And you can't tell me what the proper channels are, because that's classified information?
Sign here please.
Listen .. um ... I don't want to get involved in any of this. But I work at the Ministry of Information, and I happen to know that Information Retrieval have been looking for an Archibald Tuttle, Heating Engineer. You wouldn't by any chance be -
What do they want you or?
Frank, take it easy. what happened?
So, Frank, am I going to live?
I've been thinking about things. Meditating on my financial future. You guys gave me plenty of time to meditate on the future. Whatja do, stop for Chinese on the way over? There's plenty of food in my place.
What about Kanita?
That's too bad. Get some money, a nice looking girl on your arm, and everyone wants to take a piece. Some kid I wouldn't let wash my Mercedes is in my house, shooting at me. Damn, I thought I could make it onto the balcony like Tiger. He's fat, that's why, falls faster. I'm trying to watch my weight, and look what happens. Am I shot, Frank?
That's a hell of a swing you got there, Noel. I'm thinking Strawberry in his prime.
That boy you brought in, he was shot, wasn't he?
He's dead, huh?
I think this place stinks.
Did you see my father?
It's crazy in there. What's wrong with that doctor? He keeps mumbling, poking himself in the eye when he talks to me.
I'm only asking because it's a dangerous building. There's been some robberies, a woman was raped not long ago. This woman I'm seeing, she'll want to talk to me all day, but if I can point to you out the window and say you're waiting, I can be out quick. if anything happens, I'll be in apartment 16M.
If I'm not back in fifteen minutes, hit the buzzer. That way she'll let me go.
He's not dead. It's a heroin overdose. Break out the Narcon.
I hate vodka.
I'll drink to that.
Would you like to come in?
Get this, Frank--we got two patients. Number one, the scarecrow outside. Number two misses the railing but breaks both legs on the balcony, then throws himself through a glass window, heads to the bedroom, where he's now passed out.
I don't think the fire people can touch him out there.
Turn it off.
Jesus, Tom Walls, that crazy motherfucker.
...outlaw nation but strangely those who have interviewed Gaddafi find him, in a phrase we like to use in this country, very 'presidential'.
I'm in a pissy mood.  I'm sorry.
Yes.  You're not going to stick around for the farewell party?
Where's where I asked him about being scared?  You should work on your speech.
Me again.  Hi.  Listen Gaddafi doesn't foam at the mouth or anything.  When you speak to him he's not at all nuts. He seems like a leader -- very impressive, self-control...that's what's so strange.
I told what's his name -- Tom -- that I'd meet him.
I don't know.  I may be in love with him.
Let's go...
That's it.  I resign as of now.
All this business of war -- do you get scared?
You don't have time.  Not a chance.
Play back the last line...
Is everything all right?
Anchor?
I broke up with my roommate -- He was really the magnet for everyone who knew anything.
Look, I can start up with him again if you really...
I got my report card.  Three Cs, two Ds and an incomplete.
Come on...Even I'm not that hard on myself.
Hi.
Can I buy you dinner sometime soon?
Jane?
I'll wait for you till seven.
Suppose I go in for a little while and you wait in the lobby-bar.  How's that?
Hi, again.  Sorry about...
I don't know if that's absolutely necessary.
Uh-huh.
You're lucky I came after you so you got that off your...
I converted a bedroom -- this stuff builds up.  Wait till you've been doing this sixteen years.
Tonight.
What the hell's going on?
What did he do?
Gee..twenty five dollars for something I made!
It's true, isn't it?
But you gotta love me!  Why do you think I made that statue of Alice?!
Ah, your new head shot...  I like it, very much...
Well then admit it, it's a work of genius.
Man that's a trippy name, kinda like the Warhol mayhem series...
Now what kind of statue was that?
Where'd ya buy that?
Go home.
You better hold off on the bubbly.
You might talk too much.
Hello, Walter.
Yes, you have.  Can I come in?
YOU'RE GONNA SHOOT ME!
After that we go no more!
Oh, hello Mrs. Swicker.
Oh, OK.
I had a salami sandwich, Mrs. Swicker.
What's wrong with you!?!
Don't grab me, okay?
Rich bitches.  They're a plague. They've gotta be stopped.
They're all the same!  They're so stuck up, they're just... they're not even human.  I hate them.
Yes.  Definitely.  Definitely. Please, God.
I got a news flash, man, another shot of this and I'll have sex with you.
Are there any good sicknesses that aren't too depressing?
Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.
Ah, my fool is dead.  He was careless, always.  Still, I'll pull out your tongue for that.  Don't you understand?  I've killed you a dozen times.  Your life is not a blink of my eye, not a single breath.  I have lived in the shadows, in the pulsing filth behind men's eyes.  A thousand years, and more. I have conversed with the worms that fed on my corpse and I have bathed in the blood of emperors.
You had a car full of stuff.  Were you leaving?
Well, stay here tonight.
Where are you gonna go?
Leave me alone.
Can't.  History report.  The Normans and the Saxons.
I really can't.  Besides, it's pretty interesting.
Like what?
You were supposed to be here at three.
Buffy, what is your sitch?  You're acting like The Thing From Another Tax-Bracket; it's too weird.
I had a dream once where I was... There was like, knights in it, and I worked in this bar.  And I... was fighting.  I'm always fighting. And there's a guy...  He's not always there, but he's horrible, all white, and he's always... trying to kill me.
What, um...  What do we do?
Why do you keep saying that?
A Vampire-King?  You mean like Dracula?
Oh, him.
What?
I still don't get how they happened to come to my town.  I mean, was I born here because... because they were coming here?  That Lothos guy, and his buddies?
Great.  First I have a birthright, now I've got a fate.  Hey, do I have to take notes on this?
He was slow.  Very simple.  They won't all be that easy.
And the alley was a mistake.  Never corner yourself like that.  If they'd come at you in force you'd be dead now.  One vampire is a lot easier to kill then ten.
Wait!
Don't worry, Jennifer.  Someday your prince will come.
I can't!
Why?  Why me?
I can't believe they still ate it.
The don't.  You kind of wish they would, though.
I'm sorry.  I'm Pike.  This is Benny.
I really was way way too too.
Mmm, hmmm.  You shoulda seen how many people came to the airport to see me off.  When I got drafted first it was the happiest day of my Father's life.  He likes baseball more than I do...
I wanted to be the host of Dance Fever, somethin' like that...
God, I never thought of that.
God...I think I'm gonna be sick--
We lost.
Omigawd, honey, I'm so happy for you.
I'm committed to Nuke for the season.  You had your chance the other night.
Young men are uncomplicated.  And he's not "dim".  He's just inexperienced.  My job is to give him "life-wisdom" and help him make it to the major leagues.
Why baseball?
Take this to Ebby in the dugout between innings.
Ebby Calvin LaLoosh.
I got him on the knee!
You got a Hall of Fame arm but you're pissing it away.
You don't need a quadraphonic Blaupunkt--you need a curve ball.  In the Show, everybody can hit the fastball.
You told him I was throwing a deuce, right?
Settle what?
I don't wanta fight you, I wanta thank you.  Let's have a drink and forget this--
I'm too old for this shit.  Why the hell am I back in "A" ball?
Hi, Jimmy.  Want a ride?
No.
Patkin was a tribute to baseball...
Look at yours.
Look at that. Look at this. There's nothin'... look how many blueberries your muffin has and how many mine has. Yours is falling apart. I have nothing.
He even played golf with the President.
But Andy also took orders. And when he was told to give a pension fund loan to Philip Green...
Stop -
Hey!
Sam, let me ask you a question. You must really trust your wife.
No, tha-that's good. It's just unusual. To tell you the truth, so many of my clients don't.
You know, havin' some fun with it, shit like that.
He bet like a fuckin' brain surgeon.
After we ate, we left Jennifer and Ginger alone and we took a ride to talk. And then... he hit me with it.
No, of course not.
Sure, you have my permission. But I - I just gotta tell you it's no joke out here. It's no joke, you know? You gotta keep a low profile. It's not like back home. Right off the bat, they don't like guys like us. And this sheriff's a real cowboy. Even the coppers aren't afraid to bury people out in the desert here.
Nick, I gotta tell you, I got pinched twice for no reason. You really gotta be careful. I'm running a licensed place. Everything's legit.
He insulted Billy. And then I walked over to him politely...
What?
So what do you think I do? I threw that cocksucker out.
Hello.
Where the fuck you get off talkin' to people about me behind my back? Goin' over my head?
What people! What'd you think, I wasn't gonna find out?
No? You said I'm bringin' heat on you?! I gotta listen to people because of your fuckin' shit?! You're ordering me out?! You better get your own fuckin' army, pal!
You want me to get out of my own fuckin' town?!
Oh, I don't know whether you know this or not, but you only have your fuckin' casino because I made that possible!
I'm what counts out here! Not your fuckin' country clubs or your fuckin' TV shows! And what the fuck are you doin' on TV anyhow?!
You know I get calls from back home every fuckin' day?!  They think you went batshit!
Your fuckin' ass! You could have had the food and beverage job without goin' on television!  You wanted to go on TV.
You're makin' a big fuckin' spectacle of yourself.
Oh, sure. Now you want to blame your fuckin' license on me, is that it?
Back -
Back - Back up, back up a fuckin' minute here. One minute. I asked you?! When the fuck did I ever ask you if I could come out here?! Get this through your head, you -
Hey, house is doin' well.  Hey, all that money is rollin' in. I appreciate you takin' the time to see a poor ol' civil servant.
Hello.
To Abraham Lincoln.
...she took care of the valet parkers, the guys who could get you anything and take care of anything.
Hi. Nice to see you.
You see, if a phone's tapped, the Feds can only listen in...
...routine calls, they have to click off after a few minutes.
I want you out of here! I want you out of here!
All right... I didn't have lunch with Jennifer.
I was with somebody.
I'm afraid to let her in the house.
I'm afraid she's gonna destroy stuff.
Loose machines are right back over there.
Okay, I'll -
Well...
Yeah, okay.
All right, I will, I will.
I do understand that. I'll get right on it. And thank you.
I just wanna get out of here.
I'm sorry. I made a bad mistake.
Yeah.
No, I don't want one.  Hey, Mr Clark, how you doin'?
I've been trying to reach you. You're tougher to get than the President.
Yeah, least you could do is return my phone calls, though.
Yeah.  I think I want my money back.
You know... I think that you've gotten the wrong impression about me. I think in all fairness, I should explain to you what it is that I do. For instance, tomorrow morning I'll get up nice and early, take a walk down over to the bank and walk in and see you, and, uh... if you don't have my money for me, I'll crack your fuckin' head wide open in front of everybody in the the bank. And just about the time that I'm comin' out of jail, hopefully, you'll be comin' out of your coma. And guess what?  I'll split your fuckin' head open again. Because I'm fuckin' stupid. I don't give a fuck about jail.  That's my business. That's what I do. And we know what you do, don't we, Charlie? You fuck people out of money and get away with it.
Hey, you fat Irish prick. You put my fuckin' money to sleep. You go get my money, or I'll put your fuckin' brain to sleep.
Hey!
Beautiful. You got a beautiful swing.
Now, I want you to get out there and get me singles and doubles, okay? 'Cause that's what's gonna win this game.
Now go out there and show your dad what you can do.
You know, he's gotta realize everything can't be a home run that he does.
It's instinctive, you know.
Carmine? He was here before. I saw him. He had a suitcase and everything, and then he left.
I mean, unless Ace made his bet.
And take it easy with this shit, will you? I mean, this can only make matters worse.
You're a beautiful girl. You don't want to ruin your looks. I've seen a lot of girls get shot to hell from this stuff.
I do. I need a new sponsor.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Nicky, please...
Thank you. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Thank you, sir, I appreciate that. Everybody, thanks. Gives some chips as tips to the dealer and box man. Thanks. Take care, Steve. Take chances and drive fast.
What does that mean? No, I know that look. What does that mean?
Wow.
Incredible.
I actually turned my bedroom into a bank vault where I kept the choice stuff.
Mm.
They're havin' a good time too.
Frankie!
I've never trusted him. And you know I got eyes...
All right, take it easy now, take it easy.
I know, but that's enough.
I know it, I know it.
Take it easy, though.
You'll get a heart attack like that.
Have we reached the epi-center?
What's the matter...
I'll bet the butler's name wasn't "Jeff."
No-o. You know, questions like that don't help your cause--
You're kidding.
Will you please stop fighting?  Just let those people die so we can get on with our new lives together!  Trust me, one day we'll look back on this day and laugh. You got to admit, it's a lot more fun to be the villain.
Right time. That was kind of fun. She had spunk.
You like them, don't you, Boss.
Spooky.
There you are, Selina. I've been thinking..I have some.."positions" opening up..
Oh, what?  I offer you a job in implied exchange for physical favors and suddenly it's "sexual harassment..."
I'm afraid last night was the last straw of our city's tourists. The Mayor, in his finite wisdom, is throwing a "Month of the Woman" luncheon ball for the public this afternoon to try and calm everyone down. I thought maybe you and I could...
I'll take your abuse, but it's way too early for the sanctimonious Cult of Gag...
Hey Buddy!  Can you let me pull over?  Give me some space to pull over.
Any place.
I know.  But it's an emergency. Somebody dying.  Okay?
I know where it is.  Give me that phone back.
She can't!  It's busted.  Now hand that on back!
Nels reporting in.  Sit down where you are.  Arms folded.
Now turn around.  I'm going to cuff you.
You never miss a trick.
Nels, don't let that cop pass you.
Fine, no tunnel.  Are you still with me?  Hello?
What do you do for a living?
Our house always needs touching up.
I didn't mean to insult you. You're an artist.
Wait just a minute.  Our luck has changed.
Rachel was terrified when I left her.  I could see it in her eyes.
She'll never be the same.  None of us will.
I'm still okay.
He wants 75 back.
Did you hear that?
I'm going to cuff you and leave you in that house.  It may take awhile but you'll be found after we're long gone.
Thank God -- thank God I've got you.
I'm opening the side door.  She'll step out.  But before she gets in your vehicle I want to see the first installment put down in plain view.  If it isn't there I'm shooting her in the back.
That's how it is.  You see her approaching you toss out installment one.
Yeah?
Since when did you guys start changing tires?
Seems not.
Something was rattling around. Some loose tools.
So can we consider you a regular, sir?
That's what he said. Jimmy.
Cunt. Scrag-eyed dyke cunt.
Do it on your own time, Paddy.
That should make her happy.
Now, if you asked me to meet you tomorrow, it would really drive him insane.
Sorry. How'd he drive with his neck in a brace?
So what do you want with me, Jimmy?
What does that mean?
Never let the sun go down on an argument, Jody used to say.
Got your note. So let's kiss and make up, hon.
Sorry, darling.
There's Dave. He knew too.
She own you, Jimmy?
She from Scotland too?
And you're not going to tell me more?
Why?
Are you all right, Dil?
See, I should blow you away, Jimmy. But I can't do that. Yet.
She was --
Yes.
You'll notice I've asked you nothing.
Leave her out of this.
Made the front page. They'll move now, the fuckers.
Why would you do that?
So?
You sure?
And what's she like between the sheets?
And who is she?
And you know what'll happen if you fuck up again, don't you?
Now, if you took the ropes off, I'd be able to feed myself.
So when you come to shoot me, Paddy, remember, you're getting rid of a shit- hot bowler.
Where would you most like to be now, man?
Come on, man. If this shit was all over.
You lack imagination, Fergus. Think of something more alluring.
Not a lot of use, are you, Fergus?
I never know nothing.
Now Dyle, you listen to me -- my mama didn't raise no stupid children. I know who's got the money 'n I ain't disappearing till I got my share -- 'n' my share's growin' a whole lot bigger ev'ry day.
I know why you're not taken -- no one can catch up with you.
as outlined in report number three- nine-stroke-five-two of the Western Hemisphere Conference held on March 22 --  no wait! It was last Thursday, five o'clock at the Jardin des Champs- lyses! Adam -- that was it! The garden!
I'm sorry I thought you were the murderer, Adam -- how did I know that he was as big a liar as you are?
The truth, now -- was it my hide -- or the stamps?
Why not?
Oh.
Are you sure there's no mistake?
Sorry about that.
Good morning, Mr. Dyle.
It's the only name I've got. How about you?
Why you lied to me.
Well, you know now, so please tell me who you are.
Carson Dyle is dead.
Your --
They've got Jean-Louis!
Hurry up and change -- I'm starved.
Monsieur Flix -- ?
Yes.
Mrs. Lampert --
Didn't Charles tell you, Mrs. Lampert?
It doesn't belong to you, Mrs. Lampert -- you do know that, don't you?
Mrs. Lampert, any morning now you could wake up dead.
Dead, Mrs. Lampert -- like last week's news -- like Charles, Mrs. Lampert --
Of course it is.
But he is gone.
What was all that?
You mean you and me?
Go on.
No, it isn't -- where's the money?
So they think he left it with you.
It belongs to me, Miz Lampert -- an' if you don't give it to me your life ain't gonna be worth the paper it's printed on. You savvy what I'm sayin', Miz Lampert?
Who is it from?
Yeah. Chris BERRINGER WAS PARKED OUTSIDE THE WINDOW.
If I'd gone public with this yesterday Annette Michaels might be alive today.
is there anything you do?
I'm going to tell them everything I know. I'm calling a town meeting for eight p.m.
You know her?
Who is she Daddy?
Hello?
She's not here.
St. Michael's.
Please get out of my way or I'll have to hurt you.
The seat behind him is open. Come on, I can eavesdrop too.
You ok?
Hurricane Hormone. it's flattened the whole school. Guess what?
Mark invited me to the party.
Shh. Ben's party. Tonight. Haven't you heard?
All our parents are weirdoes. I think my dad is into hookers. I know he lit cats on fire when he was a kid.
I think this is a big part of growing up. It's losing your spiritual virginity. It's when you finally discover that your parents aren't anything they told you they were. They're even bigger hypocrites than your friends.
But if he'd been sent to jail, there would be no Jody.
What are you doing?
Yes?
There's Jan and Heather. Let's grab them quick before someone else does.
Hide your laptop here.
You can't bring it.

Come on, Night Shift.
No cell.
Probably because they know a psycho when they hear one.
...I'm not the psycho.
...reconsider that statement there, Night Shift.  You're psy-...
...-er!
Every time I look at you, I wanna hit...
You wanna hit me?
...I believe in live and...
...let live.
I did not steal the truck.
It was owed to me.  You stole the damn...
Shut up, shut up!  It's beeping.
...waiting!
I don't want you to come anyway. 
Come on!

You just can't leave that stuff with that lu-...
...-natic.
...to him. 
You got Elvis?!
Go!
Stop.
Hang...
Unbe-fucking-lievable.

What'd you come back for?!


What'd he say?
So you called the damned thing Elvis
 Eighteen men were k- killed in sec-...
...here.   Mason... 
...about the man who did this, he's-he's comin' after it.
 ...have it.  You have to...have to get it to M...to McGruder.
Whoo-hoo! 
Do you know what'll...
Brynner.
Good to see you again, Leo.
I can't say it's a surprise.
As soon as I heard Elvis was on the loose, you came to mind.
Dennis, radio the bikes.  I wanna know if so much as a squirrel...
Carl, establish contact with that deputy we met earlier.  He'll be more useful now.
Shit.
Yeah, I'm listenin'.
Yeah?
And don't give him any ice cream...
 Two pots of coffee...
Major, we've gotta seal that tunnel!  Major!
What the hell are you talkin' about...
Yeah, I just....
And only then does our noble friend realize...
Let me see your...

...gotta seal it.
Sir?
I've got the photographs in my office. If they'll help you remember. What was the argument about?
What about her?
They don't kill a guy for that.
Then what'll you do?
I don't want it anymore.
No. It was an accident.
It's too late.
No.
No. I went riding rather early.
No, Just riding bareback, that's all. Anyway, you might try the Oak Pass or Stone Canyon Reservoirs. Sometimes at lunch Hollis takes walks around them. Otherwise he'll be home by 6:30.
I don't like the word 'cheat.'
Mr. Gittes.
You've got one going, Mrs. Mulwray.
As little as possible.
I can't...
...he had a breakdown... the dam broke... my mother died... he became a little boy... I was fifteen... he'd ask me what to eat for breakfast, what clothes to wear!... It happened... then I ran away...
Hello, Miss Sessions. I don't believe we've had the pleasure.
Can I help you?  Russ Yelburton, Deputy Chief in the Department.
The water.
When it comes.
Can't we talk about this alone, Mr. Gittes?
Of course not.
Jesus Christ, Walsh. That's what you spent your day doing?
Course, she settled down nicely.
That's for sure.
Oh, you know. She was sixteen or seventeen.
You understand which side the gelatin's on?
Eh! Love...what a mystery!  I understand you, Toto...The ones with blue eyes are the most beautiful. Whatever you do, you can't make friends with them.  Eh, there's nothing to be done about it! The heavier a man is, the deeper his footprints. And if he's in love, he suffers, because he knows he's up a one-way street. Because love is a meaningless thing when a man gets it into his head to do what he wants... 
Good morning, father. It's hard on the feet, huh?
So what'd they say?
I don't remember him any moreMa, where's Russia?
Mr. Bernstein, Mr. Thatcher -
Three cents.
So then, tonight, we go over everything thoroughly, eh?  Especially the new papers -
Wasted?
Well, he'll be coming back in September. The Majestic.  I got the reservations. It gets in on the ninth.
I'm still hungry, Brad.  Let's go to Rector's and get something decent.  The "Chronicle" has a two-column headline, Mr. Carter.  Why haven't we?
If the headline is big enough, it makes the new big enough.  The murder of Mrs. Harry Silverstone -
The "Chronicle" doesn't say she's murdered, Mr. Carter.  It says the neighbors are getting suspicious.
That's the kind of thing we are going to be interested in from now on, Mr. Carter.  Right now, I wish you'd send your best man up to see Mr. Silverstone.  Have him tell Mr. Silverstone if he doesn't produce his wife at once, the "Enquirer" will have him arrested.  Have him tell Mr. Silverstone he's a detective from the Central Office. If Mr. Silverstone asks to see his badge, your man is to get indignant and call Mr. Silverstone an anarchist. Loudly, so that the neighbors can hear.
What story, Mr. Rogers?
I'm sending Junior home in the car, Charles - with Oliver -
There's a call I want you to make with me, Charles.
Charlie, you're just excited.  You don't realize -
Where's the towel?
Thanks.
Don't you realize that everybody here is going to know about this? That you've packed your bags and ordered the car and -
You goin', Mom?
Close the door, Raymond.
Well, gentlemen, are we going to war?
It'll be our first foreign war in fifty years, Brad.  We'll cover it the way the "Hickville Gazette" covers the church social!  The names of everybody there; what they wore; what they ate; who won the prizes; who gave the prizes -  I tell you, Brad, I envy you.  By Bradford Leland, the "Enquirer's" Special Correspondent at the Front. I'm almost tempted -
I'll tell you what I'll do, Brad - I'll get drunk, too - maybe that'll help.
We'll withdraw support completely. Anything else?
What check?
Oh, yes, the bonus.
Brief marriage!  Ten years! 
Thompson!
Hold this thing up for a week.  Two weeks if you have to...
I did a lot of singing after that. I sang for Charlie -  I sang for teachers at a hundred bucks an hour - the teachers got that, I didn't -
Jesus!
Hey Caitlin...  Break his heart again this time, and I'll kill you. Nothing personal.
Territoriality. He was mine first.
And the fact that there weren't any lights made it so...  God! That was so great!
Yeah, right. Who was it: Randal?
What about Caitlin?
I'M GONNA BREAK YOUR FUCKING HEAD! YOU FUCKING JERKOFF!
Well, he missed!
You open?
You don't want to know.
She called me.
One fight a day with Veronica is about all I can stomach, thanks.
I guess it's not really fighting. She just wants me to leave here, go back to school, get some direction.
You win.
Seven months.
Five years.
Eight and a half.
Party at John K's-senior year. I get blitzed and pass out in his bedroom. Caitlin comes in and dives all over me.
In the middle of it, she calls me Brad.
She called me Brad.
I hit the lights and she freaks. Turns out she thought I was Brad Michaelson.
She was supposed to meet Brad Michaelson in a bedroom. She picked the wrong one. She had no idea I was even at the party.
Great story, isn't it?
Interesting postscript to that story: Do you know who wound up going with Brad Michaelson in the other dark bedroom?
Allan Harris.
The two moved to Idaho together after graduation. They raise sheep.
It takes different strokes to move the world.
Because there was a lot of good in our relationship.
I'm serious. Aside from the cheating, we were a great couple.  That's what high school's all about-algebra, bad lunch, and infidelity.
They are. When she calls me now, she's a different person-she's frightened and vulnerable. She's about to finish college and enter the real world. That's got to be scary for anyone.
I'm talking to myself here.
...and she's looking to me for support. And I think that this is leading our relationship to a new level.
I think the arguments Veronica and I are having are some kind of manifestation of a subconscious desire to break away from her so that I can pursue the possibility of a more meaningful relationship with Caitlin.
I think it's safe to say yes.
All four?
Why do you do things like that? You know she's going to come back and tell the boss.
I'm gonna hear it tomorrow.
What for? They don't bother me if I don't bother them.
There aren't.
It's not really anyone per se, it's more of separate groupings.
The milkmaids.
Helluva game!
Hockey's hockey. At least we got to play.
Bitch, bitch, bitch. You want something to drink? 
Let me borrow your car.
Fine. Just lend me your car.
I want to rent a movie.
Maybe the Asian design major slipped her some opium?
I threw out the stuff that got broken. The floor looks clean.
I am not.
I work, just like you. You're more of a crook than I am, dude.
Relax brother. What I mean is that you sell the stuff in this store at the highest prices around. A dollar seventy-nine for wraps-what's that shit?
And these aren't my drugs-I just sell them.
What's that mean?
All right. How much is Pepsi here?
At Food City it's ninety-nine cents, plus tax.
So why do you sell it for so much more? I'll tell you why-because people come here and they're like "A dollar eighty for soda? I should get it at Food City. But I don't feel like driving there. I'll just buy it here so I don't have to drive up there." That's exploiting a weakness, too, isn't it?
Hey, man, what happened with that old guy?
That's fucked up. Yo, I heard he was jerkin' off.
Probably saw that Caitlin chick. I know I felt like beatin' it when I saw her.  Come here, bitch! You like this? Is this what you want? Hunhh?
You used to go out with her?
Don't you already have a girlfriend?
Is she that girl who's down here all the time? She came here today carrying a plate of food.
And what-you were gonna dump her to date that Caitlin chick?
I don't know dude. That Caitlin chick's nice. But I see that Veronica girl doing shit for you all the time. She brings you food, she rubs your back... Didn't I see her change your tire one day?
Damn. She sure goes out of her way.
I've had girlfriends, but all they wanted from me was weed and shit.  Shit, my grandma used to say, "Which is better: a good plate with nothing on it..." No, wait. I fucked up. She said "What's a good-looking plate with nothing on it?"
What the hell was that for?
Why'd you hit me?
Do I get to hit you after you tell me?
Three?
You've only had sex with three different people?
Who?
No; who were the three, besides me?
Wow. That's great. That's something to be proud of.
Animal, vegetable, or mineral.
They put up the least amount of struggle.
All right. Name it.
Where?
Can't we ever have a discussion without that coming up?
You're damn right it's not like that! Because I won't let it be like that! You want your slut? Fine!  The slut is yours!
You don't know what you want, but I'm not going to sit here anymore holding your hand until you figure it out! I've encouraged you to get out of this fucking dump and go back to school, to take charge of your life and find direction. I even transferred so maybe you would be more inclined to go back to college if I was with you. Everyone said it was a stupid move, but I didn't care because I loved you and wanted to see you pull yourself out of this senseless funk you've been in since that whore dumped you, oh so many years ago. And now you want to go back to her so she can fuck you over some more?
Of course not; not now! You're caught, and now you're trying to snake out of doing what you wanted to do. Well, I won't let you. I want you to follow through on this, just so you can find out what a fucking idiot you are. And when she dumps you again- and she will, Dante, I promise you that-when she dumps you again, I want to laugh at you, right in your face, just so you realize that that was what you gave up our relationship for!  I'm just glad Randal had the balls to tell me, since you couldn't.
And having him tell me... that was just the weakest move ever. You're spineless.
He only speaks Russian?
I think the lady called it.
I do about three-fifty, four.
Feel that.
I just held up the same two movies. You're not even paying attention.
I don't think your manager would appreciate...
I beg your pardon!
I only pointed out that you weren't paying any attention to what I was saying.
You hope what feels good?
"It's a perfect day for a monster jump."  Hey man, can you like do me a favor?
Next time you're like watching MTV, y' know, like flip it to the weather channel for a split second and check it out.  I mean, hey, we could be home watching some righteous pornos.
Hey, Jessie, you're just in time for another masterpiece.
Surprise me.
A monkey?
Remember, keep your arms and legs within the vehicle at all times--
Room service...Hi, Sarah.
Do you see them yet?
That's a virtue isn't it?
I know you don't want to be responsible for anybody's life anymore, but walk away and you are responsible.  Please Gabe, he went up the west ridge.  If you go up the south face, you can catch him, no problem--
Gabe...your arm?
If you're not using your arm, can I borrow it?
We might be able to go that way.
Just kidding.
Souvenirs?  No, wrong answer. Looks like your friend plans on hanging around, that possible?
What's your names?
Oh, my God!
Where's the third one, Travers?
This is insane.  The hell with the money.  You radio in for that chopper, understand!
One minoota, droogie. Dim smashes Alex in the face with a full milk bottle. He goes down. The others run away, laughing.
It's past eight, Alex, you don't want to be late for school, son.
You've not been to school all week, son.
Eeee... I'll put your breakfast in the oven. I've got to be off myself now.
Who said that?
What crime did you commit.
You are now in H.M. Prison Parkmoor and from this moment you will address all prison officers as sir! Name?
Crime?
Well, that was a very promising start. By my calculations, you should be starting to feel alright again. Yes? Dr. Brodsky's pleased with you. Now tomorrow there'll be two sessions, of course, morning and afternoon.
I imagine you'll be feeling a little bit limp by the end of the day. But we have to be hard on you. You have to be cured.
Well, of course, it was horrible. Violence is a very horrible thing. That's what you're learning now. Your body is learning it.
One jacket - blue pinstripe.
Moloko-plus.
Hi ya' doin'?  Where to?
Thanks for everything, Max.  Wow...
No.
Get outta here!  You and Louis?
What?
What?  What did you say?
What are you gonna do?
Client?  I like to think of myself as more of a friend.  A mentor.
...oh God, don't shoot me...
...why is everything always about you...
...I'm sorry, I don't see it that way...
...what do you want me to do, punch him out?  I have to work with him...
I think he's dead.
You listening to me?
Try harder.  I'm gonna count to three. One...
I don't know any Rwandans.
Oh, it's okay, then.  'Cause you're just taking out the garbage...
I had no idea these cabs came equipped with emergency strobes.  Where's the button?  Under the dash?
Show up for <u>what?</u>
You go every night?
Guy with a routine goes and breaks it? Provokes attention.  That's bad.  And that's not good...
Damn, Max.  I'm impressed.  Really.  I would have bet good money you wouldn't walk out of there.
What happened?
<u>Jerry</u>?  You didn't show last night.  First time ever.  Had me worried, boy.
It's a man without a nose you want, you dumb complicit sons of bitches!  You've got to listen to me.
What took so long?  You were in there all day.
Dead or alive, they'll stick me in there with Oswald.  Another lunatic acting alone,
If you're worried about the President, call and warn him about the Space Shuttle.
Uh uh, don't want <u>them</u> to see me.
You okay?
You gave me an hour; now give me a day.
Shoot.
I didn't mean for you to see it. It's like looking in someone's diary and taking it out of context.  Know what I mean?
So what's the question?
Answer me.  Was the first time you saw me the first time I saw you? Was it?  You've been following me around.  Do you see how that could be disconcerting to me?  That's not love, Jerry.  It's obsession. And it isn't normal and you can't expect me to respond to it and you can't expect me to feel the same way.  Can you?
I don't.  I know you wouldn't.
Liza?
Is that what they told you?
Without a song in my heart.
Do I know you?
Veritas.  Truth.  What is it they say about truth?
That's it.  I went to Yale.  I hope you won't hold that against me.
In Jerry's safety deposit box.
Go to the northeast corner.  Call a cab.  Bring the pizza.  Then there's a poem.  Roses are red, violets are blue, if the Pope goes to Washington, I would, too.
Who's the Deputy Director of the F.B.I.?
Mike, because of the Earth's rotation we're only in line with Vega so many hours a day; the only way to get the whole message is to cooperate with other stations.  If Dr. Arroway hadn't moved quickly we could have lost key elements.
... could it be a nested code of some sort?
They knew our level of development. If, as you say, they've done this many times they'd be well aware of the implications.
There's no way of knowing.  Without a key -- a primer, to help us, maybe never.
Okay, let's just slow down.  Pull up the starfield signal origin.
So why don't you admit what by your own standards must be the truth: that this experience simply didn't happen.
Am I one... or many?
What's that?
... I'm just so sick of feeling defensive about the things I care about!  Or being lumped in with the lunatic fringe by people like Drumlin, when if they'd just put aside their preconceptions for two seconds and look at the facts...
It's like the pre-Copernicans who swore the sun revolved around the Earth, or the Victorians at the end of the last century who concluded that all major discoveries had now been made.  I mean... try to imagine civilization a thousand years ahead of us -- then imagine trying to explain... I dunno, a microwave oven -- to someone even a hundred years ago -- I mean the basic concepts didn't exist...
Champagne please.
Do you really believe your life is meaningless?
And yet you're willing to die for this cause, the one thing that's given your life a sense of purpose. Don't you see the contradiction here -- ?
So.  I'm assuming they sent you here to administer last rites?
They don't believe me.
You're sure you want to?  In the universe I saw we're not exactly the stars of the show.  What happened to me makes us all seem pretty damn small.
I don't have any proof, Palmer.
It's not enough, don't you understand?  I know it happened -- but by every standard of science, by every standard I've lived my life by that fact is utterly beside the point.  It may be true but it doesn't matter because I can't prove it's real.
But --
I want to, Palmer -- more than anything.  But it has to be real. It has to be true.
I'm lucky I got a broom. Work up top. Real easy job. Man, it's gonna be hot down in that ditch.
You allus had good jobs, and that girl in Kentucky I taken a shine to her.
Well, why not? Idee of marryin' got you all choked up, trying to pretend you was respectable you was borin' the hell out of all of us.
I'm leavin' the place to John.
Nothin' to do with it. I ain't never give John the kind of feelin' I give you, so I'm payin' him off now. Don't feel you got to say anything. Way it is, sometimes, you just have a feelin' for a child or you don't, and with John I just didn't.
What's all this dirt in the yard?
You gonna get used to wearing them chains aftera while, Luke. But don't you never stop listenin' to them clinkin'. That's gonna remind you of what I been sayin'.
She looks just like Mrs. Patricia Handy, a married woman... I useta fool with. Man, I kin sniff blondes from a hunnert yards and redheads from a mile and a half.
Oh lookit that brunette.
Slow down, man. They ain't passing out medals for slinging dirt.
Where'd the road go?
Not a liar. You just have a common -- and likable -- tendency toward exaggeration.
Man! It's gonna be one hot muther today.
Yeah, found one in this supermarket, keys in the ignition.
Excuse me, but would you mind explaining why you're watching the lady upstairs?
You parked right behind him.  The one I noticed earlier.  I didn't say anything, I thought he'd leave. Just take a look.
But earlier, he was staring up here.  <u>Please</u>, Andy.
You bastard!
Who are you?
I was?  How you spell that?
I never hurt nobody...
What was that?  What am I hearing? The sound of an epiphany, a sudden blinding insight?
Mm-hmm.  I can't get to you.  You have to come to me.
Sugar and cream for Goetz; I take mine black.  You're absolutely correct.  The politicians don't want panic headlines spoiling the Festival of Love.
Would you want to work with us on this?
I think you are.  I really admire everything you've done; it would be an honor to work with you, and we need all the help we can get, especially yours.
Well, it's a hell of an apartment you got here.  I'm living one step away from the projects, myself, but I get to go to work every day, wading in blood and guts.  I guess the books you wrote about these sons of bitches paid off pretty good.
It's <u>anybody</u> connected to author- ity.  They write, they even knock on your door.  They're <u>fans</u>.  It thrills them to flirt with getting caught.
What's that siren?
Ruben's gone to look... It's banged up but it looks like a .44.  It's Son of Sam.  Is it Son of Sam?
How many do you need to sleep. Really sheep?
We're through for the night, aren't we?  You go on.  Get some sleep. I'll stay until we can get a man out here and maybe catch a cab home.
Open the door.  Please.
What am I wasting my time with this shit for?
Not what I meant; why <u>me</u>?
Get Mercer to run the medical, dental, legal bills, laundry and dry cleaning receipts, extermin- ators, mailmen, grocery and drugstore deliveries, handymen, plumbers...
Get the pictures, and casts of footprints.
There was no sperm.
What are you looking at that for? Helen Hudson.  Work the clues.
You want mine, too?  You take his, you take mine.  I'm the one fucked it up...
Where were you?
Did you come?
He must have tucked a lot of women in that huge car of his. It's like a bed on wheels. It must smell of semen...
Do you find him attractive?
Would you like to tuck him, though? In that car?
Have you seen his penis?
The airport? Why? Are you leaving?
I take it you're not wearing white to reassure them.
So - why the airport?
What does he want from you?
I'm going to leave now. Do you want a lift?
I'm the only doctor making rounds this morning.
This doctor, was he tall, with dark hair?
So, we'll meet every Tuesday and Friday. And if you have any kind of emergency, you can page me.
It was just a little going-away gesture.
Where's the old bag I sometimes call Mommy?
Letty, dinner's almost ready.   The souffle...
Are you sure, Dear?
It's so good to see you, Sweetheart.
Michael just got a job.    Couldn't you congratulate him?
No, 79. Sorry, this makes me nervous.
You missed out on some great broccoli florets at dinner.
John even managed to lob a load of mashed potatoes into Mrs. Hallstrom's milk.
Was it bad news--the visit from Peter?
Thanks.    Where've you been all day?
Well?
You've got to see the kitchen first.
I love your apartment.
Gosh, Letty, this is a great place.
How may I help you?
I sure know what that feels like.
So, another one bites the dust.
It's just I've got those parent conferences, and I'm supposed to set up the math program by next week. And shopping for Ruth's dress and that, that engagement dinner.
No, I can't. I've already convinced both Mom and Dad to come.
Sure. We'll save the formal announcement for when you're out. I already told your mother. I hope you don't mind.
So will you?
Well, I understand.     I know my behavior was poor.
Look, Gail, I've been a good teacher.
Believe me, I wish I'd understood what was going on. I've worked really hard to get better.
What the fuck was all that about at the hotel last night? I thought we had a deal?
You've already robbed the safe?
They're gonna be what?
Tonight?
Why is everything an argument with you?
Turn on the flashlight.
You call being Bastaldi's lap dog better?
They'll be waiting for us at the airport.
Did you have to use that much explosive?
Hey boss, it's not a science.
There's an exterior alarm system. There's also another one in the hall that leads to the bedroom with a motion detector. The control panel is in the bedroom.
Oh, man... this is bullshit!    You can't trust anyone these days.
Today's your lucky day, Sami.
Normally I'd be breaking your fingers right now, but I'm going to give you a chance to make enough to pay me back and have some extra for yourself. We have a group going to Chicago to do a job. You're going with them.
You lived there. You know the city.
Who is closer to the wall, Joey or me?
I'm glad you didn't get something flashy.
You put a loaded gun in your bag and brought it through customs? How stupid is that?
So, how did you get hooked up with these guys?
The art world doesn't fully appreciate my talent yet. I needed some way to pay the rent. Laurant and Vincent pay well for information.
She seems pleasant enough.
Go ahead.
Why do you want to teach me?
And if I use them to kill you?
This spells trouble.
You, sister...
They forced me to marry!
You know about Lo?
Where is he now?
You're working together to set me up!  I'm leaving!
Let's stop a moment.
Do you remember the legend of the young man?
Don't you want to see her again.
It's Jade Fox!
What in the hell... do you call that?
Are you nuts, walking into a gun?
They couldn't do anything for me.
I can pick out a tune now and again.
Does she have a name?
I know your friend, too -- the one that looks like a rock star.
Cute nickname, don't you think?
What the hell are you?
Coupla more rings... 24k.
...necklace... pearls...
An unexpected pleasure.
Who got himself what?
I had heard something like this.  Describe it for me.  The "hit".
I know of no one.  But even if there is, I am sure it is nothing outside your capacity to deal with?
You promise not to say anything?
Do you deny that there's an attraction between us?
What are you reading?
Somerset Maugham.
You really want to know?
Why are you trying to hurt me?
I'm in the bath, mom.
Calm down. Tell me what's wrong.
What do you mean?!
Cecile, you have to tell me.
Does your mother know?
Why didn't you do something?
So, let me get this straight. You came over to our house late last night and he forced intercourse on you.
He made you give him a blow job.
Okay, okay. I'll just call your mom and have her come pick you up.
But you said you have the worst reputation.
Don't you want to change that?
I think that's all the time we have for today.
No. This is going to be our last session.
This isn't a joke. Your parents spend a lot of money to send you here. I'm trying to help you.
Whoa!
And when I confronted him about his affair with Cecile he told me it was none of my business. Then when I said "Well what about Ronald," he said you were nothing more than a stupid... the n word and that you deserved what you got...
It's been going on for a while.  Then he called me a disgrace to our family and that's when he hit me.
I'd be careful if I were you. God knows what he's up to.
Will you stay here for the night? You can leave in the morning. That's when my parents get back and --
Oh gee, your journal. Could you be more queer?
Moving along quite well.
Any day now.
If you're heading towards her room, you won't find her.
You don't know?  She left thirty minutes ago.
I thought we should celebrate.
Ronald?
I got your message and came as quick as I could.
Not at all. What's wrong?
What about her?
Kathryn, you have my word. It isn't drugs is it?
Ronald? That's crazy.
Did I ever tell you the time when my late husband sent me -
I'm so glad to have met you at last. You're just as nice as Amy told me you were.  I hope you'll come to see us.
But Edward, in this kind of a wish that doesn't matter.
Mommy, could Edward take me to Mrs. Farren's house to give her her present?
But it won't be Christmas tomorrow.
What is it, Alice?
I got lots of presents.
These are all from me.
Who are you?
Irena. But who are you?
I've wanted a friend.
But where do you come from?
But where is that?
Will you be friend for always?
I shall want you for always.
Not even Daddy...or Mommy?
It's you...Irena...my friend!
About time for you to come home, Amy.
The Headless Horseman --
You didn't even open my present and I'm your daughter.
...At the hour of midnight, down the road that goes through Sleepy Hollow, across the bridge, he goes galloping, galloping, always searching, always seeking
I didn't even have to coax her tonight.
Guess you like those Coyote Ugly steaks now, huh?
PMS. What symptoms are you experiencing?
That's just part of being a woman. Diet and exercise should help. Avoid salt, sugar, starches, caffeine, alcohol...
And keep a journal of your symptoms to make sure it's related to your period and not just in your head.
Okay, just one more stop and you'll be all set. Victoria's Secret.
It's not about him seeing you in it. It's how you feel. You'll feel sexy in lingerie and it'll show. It's an inner thing.
Are those Mark's?
Bag means condom now? I can't keep up with the word "bag." It used to be "No, that's not my bag" -- meaning not my thing. But now "my bag" means "my fault."
Hello?
I've been here. What day is it?
Shit, I guess I missed work.
Oh no.
Oh my god Jennifer. I should go to confession.
I think I just got my period.
Probably for three weeks or so anyway. I'm not sure -- I don't get how it works.
You're such a good friend.
You hungry?
Hey wait, I paid three bucks for that burger. You owe me...
Mr. Grant. Did you read that script I was talking about?
No.
No. I quit. Take your lame ass ideas, your fake ass toupee, your fat ass wife and your ugly ass kids and shove them.
How about you? Briefs or boxers?
Cool. I don't get guys who wear boxers. My ex wore boxers. I never got how he could wear khakis and not have his boxers bunch up.
Uh.... hi!
What's with the squirt guns?
You know, I've never seen your cat.
I knew you wouldn't kill me.
We can work this out. Other couples have worse problems.
Sure. Cheating, lying. What's a little werewolf a few days a month? We can move out to the country where you can feed off deer.
No way can anything be proved. All they have are some wolf hairs. No one believes in werewolves.
We can get a warrant if you like.
I'm supposed to put up with a fuckin' cat I'm allergic to cause your friend's got PMS?
You have some weird friends. What does her thinking she's a werewolf have to do with us having the cat?
Frida's sheets checked out fine. It was just her own blood. From her... you know.
Hey, there was a lot of blood.
You think mafia hit?
It has to be Frida. This makes three guys ripped apart who are tied to her ass.
They don't speak English...
Good evening, sir.
Im your new assistant.
They didn't have faces.
You see it?
Where does it lead?
Bad dreams?
You're a liar!
Uh --Mr. Alexander?
Is this dangerous or anything?
Dave...
You're nothing.  Do you understand me! You're NOBODY...
You're lint!  You're a flea!  You're a blip!
A condition...
When does it break?
Alan, we still have to control this guy...
You're kidding.
Three years.
I'm serious, Dave -- you could get in a lot of trouble for something like this.
They could put you in jail.
Will he be alright?
Gimme a quarter.
What are they?
Really?
Well...
... You know, if you want to be the same old bastard, that's fine.  I can handle it.   But don't pull this 'man of the people' bullshit and then do something like this.
That's not just a works bill you vetoed -- that would have given these kids homes...  ... When I think about that little spectacle you pulled with those muppets and that magic trick...
How were you gonna get home?
So what do you do the rest of the time?
Yes.
I saw you on T.V... at his funeral.
Please....shoot me.
I know it hurts. But it won't be long. Then all the pain will be over. Oh, I wish you could hear me. GOD, GIVE HER THE EARS TO HEAR ME SO SHE KNOWS I DON'T WANT HER TO HURT SO!
I can find it myself. I didn't come that far.
There ya go. Complete with air canisters...little motors.
What?
Aaaaaaah...my God...my God...I am heartily sorry...for having offended Thee....offended Thee...
Mary.
Sounds boring to me.
You know how many demerits we're talking?
All I'm saying is we have to be careful. We can't get caught.
God, I can't take it anymore!  If I don't have Chris, I'll kill myself.
I hereby declare this the Charles Dalton Cave for Passionate Experimentation.  In the future, anyone wishing entry must have permission from me.
Yeah!    Don't you guys miss having girls here?
Do you still insist that this was your idea and your idea alone?
What is this "Dead Potts Society"?  I want names.
Where'd you find them?
Don't stop.
Chris!
The hoi polloi.  Doesn't it mean the herd?
Mr. Keating? Sir? Oh Captain My Captain.  What was the Dead Poets Society?
I was just looking in an old annual and...
Wait a minute.  I don't let my parents walk on me.
I gotta get to the tryouts.  Wish me luck.
I hear we're going to be roommates. Neil Perry.
None of what Mr. Keating has to say means shit to you, does it?
Being in the club means being stirred up by things.  You look about as stirred up as a cesspool.
No, I want you in.  But being in means you gotta do something.  Not just say you're in.
Why not?  Don't you think you could be?
Er  No.
Who are you?
Right here...middle of nowhere...and the answer to your question is yes.
The one you came up to ask...are we on schedule?
Shut up! Shut up all of you! Now here's what we're doing... Mamooli is going to take you back to fix your engines, Chin and I are staying here to finish the job...
But what makes you think there aren't more of those...things...back there?
I was so goddamn close, Finnegan! So goddamn close to my island... I could almost taste the sand...
Let's just keep going.
You know what I'm gonna do after this...I'm gonna get a normal life...
I'm telling you, man, we got to give the future some serious thought.
And what have you come up with?
I thought the plan was we'd evacuate them after we got through.
She fucked us both.
Fucking women, man...
And we want you to know, Sal, that any help you might need--
Hey, Nick, I mean... This here is for the guy that gets caught!
He's real bad, Nick.
She's in back.
How was huntin'?
Get anything?
Where's it gone?
Sit with Linda, man, will ya?... Give her a beer.  Would you like a beer?
What kind of beer would you like?
Linda... Honey, what's wrong?
Won't we? Right? Am I right?
Hey, Nick?
Tomorrow I go with Vince.
Where's Vince?
Oh cards, maybe. Poker... It's getting cold, Sal. I'm going to take you in.  We'll call Angela. The guys can help her bring you home... Did I tell you I was going on a trip?
It's okay. Hey, it's okay! Just a week. Just to see Phantom Mary.
Didn't I ever tell you about Phantom Mary?
Well... Phantom Mary's on my mother's side. Naturally no one there admits it because Phantom Mary's pretty weird... You want to hear the whole story?
Quiet!... Quiet!!!... Awright, everybody, Nick has a few words.
Who is it?
What's this?
This is a war, Wade.  You against him.  Vengeance time.  The City's just in the way.  Kill the fucker. You and me.  We'll work things out when the time is right.
Don't threaten me.  I tend to take these things seriously.  And get a couple hours sleep.  You look like day old shit.
You two fucks listen up.  Doucet's killing people and you're wasting valuable time busting two-bit Technothugs.
Need help?
You sure?  I can help you.
Nobody's looking.
You can't turn him off.  He's the Commissioner.
Married?
Wanna try?
You're not pregnant, are you?
I just heard.
You be careful.
Hi.
What are those people doing there? What do they want?
Yes, you did, Daniel! I saw it from the window. And then to lie about it! Give me that beanshooter, Daniel!
Daniel give me that beanshooter!
I am just thinkin' -- now they mightn't like the idea down in Washington.
What's the matter with you?
Afraid ... of what?
Are you plumb crazy, man! What do you think happens? We're buried -- that's all.
Why do you fret about something that isn't there?
All right -- so it's buried with you!
Huh? -- What's that?  Well -- what about it? Who cares, anyhow?
Trying to break our contract again, Mr. Stone?
What a headstrong fellow! Well -- I guess you're quite prepared to suffer the consequences.
Oh no, you violated clause five of our contract and I could collect right now, if I chose.
Suddenly you seem quite desperate, Mr. Stone --  -- You know I'm a good-natured man. I'm always open to reason. With a little security -- I might--
I'm afraid that's hardly the sort of security I was thinking of --  You see -- there is that promising little fellow, your son ...
I'm sorry you can't see that, I know you could once -- you made a little speech once, that I'll always remember and I know the others do too --  They remember and they see how you have changed. That's why they didn't want to come tonight to you, Jabez -- you're as blind as a Burma bat, with your gold pot! Mind you, it's not the money, I've been talking about, it's what you make of it.
No -- you haven't time -- You haven't time for your mother, or your wife, or your child.
Oh!
Worst I had in years -- ahem -- starting a spring cold, I guess -- er -- don't happen to have a bit of camomile tea in the house, do you, Stone?
I remember Dad used to say sometimes, when they were handing out hard luck, the farmers got there first.
What do you think of that, Jabez?
Ruined -- all the fields -- ruined. 
Jabez -- Jabez!
Queer sort of weather we're having -- queer like everything else.
I feel -- fidgety, Ma -- not right at all.
Hello, Sheriff.
Mary! Ready? First bell's a-ringing!
There is nothing like a good old country breakfast. Where's Ma?
I'm John McClane.
One of yours?
Nothing...
I don't know it!  get on a Goddamn jet to Tokyo and ask the chairman! I'm telling you!  You're just going to have to kill me --
Nein, dies ein ist mein.  This time John Wayne does not walk off into the sunset with Grace Kelly.
No more jokes, drop it or she gets it between the eyes!
Mr. Takagi chose his people well, Mrs...?
Relax, Ellis.  I'm off duty.
I'm fine.  You throw quite a party.  I didn't know they had Christmas in Japan.
Al?  Al, you there?
Speaking of cows, did you ever hear so much bullshit in your life? Two hours?  That doesn't even make any sense --
The way you drove that car, I figured you for the streets.
Is that him?
You'll be okay.
No.  Look, we're kind of....
Yeah, well...maybe you better talk to one of these others, okay?
What?
Calm down, you're not ...
Okay, okay... we know it's a stickup!
For God's sake, will you please go now?  We gave you every nickel we got.
Why the hell did he do that?  What the hell did I do?
You got Bank Americard?
You don't smoke ... why do you want to start now.
I used to, but I stopped.
Because I don't want cancer.
He wants one.
What'd he say?
Why couldn't he talk about that here?
Wait a minute!  What the fuck you tryin' to tell me?
Listen, I'll never make it.  I'll have to go to the toilet.
Mom - they're sending a bus to take us to the airport.  You understand? If you're here - they're not gonna send it.  They'll think I'm gonna come out with you.
For God's sake don't start in on Heidi again ...
Mom.  Mom.  There are some things a mother shouldn't say in front of her son.
She doesn't have anything to do with it!  You understand that? Mother?  This is me!
Not now, Mom, please.
I can't, Mom.  If I come out Sal will kill them.
What the hell for?  Twenty-five years in the pen?
<i>They can do subtitles.</i>
So what?
She's right... you lost your temper... and you started cursing like some ghetto skank. You lost all credibility right there!
Is it true that you were hired to track down and capture the thieves... and then deliver them to Drake Bishop... owner of the Stratosphere Hotel & Casino?
You then learned where the thieves had hidden the money... and at the instructions of your employer went to retrieve it yourself.
HE'S STILL ALIVE, EDNA!
<i>My real father was an actor. He died when I was a little girl.</i>
Can you tell?
They need to get the introduction on camera. Just play along, alright?
Ain't nobody gonna call me a bitch without some payback.
I'm gonna leave now.
Mookie.
How come you ain't got no brothers up?
What can you say?
Eddie Lovell.
Ten.
My name is Eddie.
I said my name is Eddie Lovell.
How would I know how much it's gonna cost if I don't know what I'm buying?
Fifty cents.
Jade, you're late.
Fool, you're thirty cents away from a quarter.  How you gonna get a boat?
You're raggedy as a roach.  You eat the holes out of donuts.
Korea man is OK.  Let's leave him alone.
Whatdafuck do you want?
I'm gonna take off ya clothes.
Why you gotta curse?
Pop, I don't believe this shit.  We runnin' welfare or somethin'? Every day you give dat bum--
Give dat bum a dollar for sweeping our sidewalk.  What do we pay Mookie for?  He don't even work.  I work harder than him and I'm your own son.
I'll do that.
Some are OK.
Turn it off.
Take it easy, Pop.
CHING CHONG, What happened to your beautiful Asian accent?
HARRY? Are you okay?
My mom wants to know if you can stay for dinner.
What?
You're going to be just fine, HARRY.
Here's your lunch. And an apple and banana for extra energy.
Who's Principal Collins?
Whoa. What was that?
Your mom made a move on me.
Who knows? Maybe someday I'll be your new daddy.
I can't help my heart. And when I'm your dad, you'll have to do as I say.
Don't use that tone with me, young man.
I will stop this car right now.
You take that back!
Where did you learn that word?
These are really cold, huh?
Uh oh. Captain Rob's always been my partner.
Who's your partner?
Well... Uh...maybe... jeez, how can I say this... you and I could...perhaps ...maybe...uh... partner up?
Oh. Sorry. You're right, field trip partner is a big commitment.
Now what are you staring at, you ugly monkey?
If you have to ask, you don't know.
You certainly did.
Enough! Look what this cursed chest is doing to us.
Guys, this is much better.
You take her.
Well, what have we here? It appears be a tape.
Then where did you get this not my tape.
Where'd that come from? He holds up a giant key chain.
So could you get us into the principal's office?
He's going to be in jail for a long time.
How was that?
That's great, now make a left, then straight!
It's the big potato.
Where is it?
Wait a minute, I think I know who stole it.
My thanks.
So, this is Leto the Just...
This is a Harkonnen animal.  Let me, please, my Lord.
I can't maintain any altitude... we'll never reach the safety of rock.  Maybe that small rock.
Are you a Fremen?
Long live the fighters!
You mustn't speak of...
So <u>you</u> sleep in coffins?!
I can't believe this!  <u>I</u> sleep in coffins!
Shh!  I'm coming!  I will feed you!
Look, you seem a little agitated. Do you maybe wanna take a little break, go for a nice walk... and then we'll come back and shoot the scene?
No Bela, that's "incorporates."  Look, just say "This casket has..."
Eddie, I'm so tired... I don't know if I can handle a night shoot...
Buddy, I don't know if that's such a good idea.
Bela, I'm on your side.  C'mon, give me the gun...  If you give me the gun, I'll make you a drink.  What are you drinking?
Eddie, I want to thank you.  These last few days have been a good time.
I got the early edition!  It was just dropped off at the newsstand.
Edward, are you sure you know what you're doing?
And what about this so-called "Barbara" character?  It's obviously ME!  I'm so embarrassed!  This is <u>our</u> <u>life</u>!
Goddamn landlord.
Maybe if you'd come to the backers party, I would've gotten the money.
Look, how many times can I say I'm sorry?  I blew it!  I thought she was rich.
Eddie, which dress do you like better?
Mr. Wood?!
Glad you could fit me in your schedule.
Tor, I should be getting home.
Well, Mr. Weiss, I've never told anyone what I'm about to tell you... but I really want this job.  I like to dress in women's clothing.
No, no, not at all!  I <u>love</u> women. Wearing their clothes makes me feel closer to them.
Nah, I'm all man.  I even fought in WW2.  'Course, I <u>was</u> wearing ladies' undergarments under my uniform.
But I'm proud.  I wrote, directed, and starred in it just like Orson Welles in "Citizen Kane"!
You're not gonna believe the first picture I ever saw.  Your friend's.
You should feel lucky.  Ed's the only guy in town who doesn't pass judgment on people.
<u>It's uncanny</u>.
Ed, I got the Lugosi lookalikes outside.
Eddie, I'm just a small-town girl. I've never done this before.
Whatever happened to Norman Rockwell?
Norman Rockwell. He painted magazine covers. Folksy. A mailman, a boy scout, a kid visiting a doctor...
They celebrated the common person.
What did you study?
I don't think so.
Oh, that thing. Yeah. Did you hear about this?
Yes.
Both.
What's going on over there?
Are you asking me?
I mean bad.
I told you. If we... you know do it, they go away until ... we're done.
So? What do they think -- we're not kids --
Shari, I really like you...
...if this ...  ... weren't here... ?
So...?
Kinda'.
You're gonna be a video store clerk for the rest of your life? This is your big ambition, rearranging the "Ernest" movies?
How many opportunities are you going to get in your life?
That's right. You don't know. Doors don't fly open for guys like us.
Hi.
Uh, no, uh I'm a little tired. I fell asleep.
And each contestant gets one of these.  An "I tried to screw a network executive" tee-shirt.
That girl's an idiot.
Look, can we all just sign the releases so we can get on with this?
One night he took us editors out to celebrate after a deadline. Eventually Dave and I were left alone and we got to talking - not like teacher and student, but like two adults.
Having a problem with your eye there?
Well, good luck there, Tracy
These are a bunch of burn-outs. And look at this one, I can't even read this one.
So what brings you here?
Oh.  New cars.  I see.  Well, you came to the right place
Huh.  Right.  College.  Wow.  Where are you going?  Where 'd you get into?
I'm scared, Mr. M. I kind of don't feel ready for college.
I hope so
Without Dave around. Sherry needed a lot of help around the house.
More this way.
Oh, no.  No.  I'm just finishing up here, and I've got to get home.
We can't both run, can we?  We're brother and sister.  Can we?
Hey, Tammy, guess what happened today.
Yeah.  So guess what happened.  So Mr. McAllister, he --  Oh hi. Lisa.
I was friendly with Sue Lefferts, but we weren't really friends. You know what I mean?
Come in out of the rain, Bud.
We talked.
In the morning.
Hey, partner.  Grab a cup.
Yeah, that's Stens.
It's a suicide note.  Says he killed Jack because Jack had figured out a pornography scam Patchett was running.
We had one thing figured wrong.  I don't think Dudley workd for Patchett.
Patchett's dead.  He sent you after me.  I'd say Dudley's tying up his loose ends.
Thanks, but no thanks.
I don't have one.  Lefferts looked beat-up Christmas Eve, but didn't act it.  How come?
No.
That's right.
Why were Lefferts' eyes black?
You wanna go downtown and discuss this officially?
Cotton balls.  I found them just inside the meat locker door.
Exactly.  At least one of those animals had the brains to protect his ears.
What do you mean?
Ray, you protected Ty and Larry up in Casitas, didn't you?
You're wrong.
Dudley, we've been over this.
I... No.
No.
No.
No.
I know you mean well, Dudley, but I don't need to do it the way you did.  Or my father.
I'm loathe to kill my brother officers, Edmund.
Jack was a shame, but Dick Stensland had the audacity to try to sell me my own heroin.  Through his whore girl friend.  I sent him to make the buy.  The rest is history.
A vacuum, Edmund.  That's what we have in Los Angeles.  Sending Mickey Cohen up created it.  My containment work maintained it. Certain photographs guarantee it. Organized crime has been held back, but there's still a demand for the services it provides.
I need to speak to you.
What's on the call sheet?
Decorated?
I get the idea.  You got a description?
I want to know why you see him. Is it a Patchett payoff?
I'll take your word for it.
Let my Susie rest in peace!
That other policeman already checked under the house and found not a thing amiss.
A sweet man.
The Grauman's Chinese pot bust. He just got off the honor farm.
You tight with the D.A., trash?
How'd you like a little payback? Not to mention a donation to the widows and orphans fund.  Did you know Loew was a swish?
Yeah.  Me and Patchett go way back.
Really?  How?
209 to anyone! I need some help here!
You knew the deal. No contact.
One of many people who would live a word with you.
You've heard of the National Security Agency?
That's who they are.
Yes.
Okay.
You drive a black BMW, license plate SRK1339?
I intercepted phone calls.
They can tap anything as along as it's an airwave intercept. Cellulars and pagers your kid can do.  Hard-line calls we'd pick off the relays as they were being fed into ground cables or fired up to the SATs. We'd suck in everything. All foreign, most domestic.  Domestic was my group. Druggies, radicals, loud-mouths. Anyone we wanted.
Meade has 18 underground acres of computers. They scan <u>every</u> phonecall for target words like "bomb" or "President". We red-flag phone numbers or voice prints...whatever we wanted. When the computers found something, it was bounced to comparative analysis.
That was twenty years ago. With digital? They can suck a salt grain off a beach.
It was '72. I figured we had enough problems without monitoring a Berkeley kid's class schedule. So I sold my story to <u>Ramparts</u> and split.
Drive.
Drive.
Drive or I'll blow your fuckin' head off.
Goddammit--
Feeling lucky?
I know, but--
That's my point.
Well, I need to find out as much about Daniel as possible.
Because my life is being ruined.
Stacy?
Stacy, I found out like this. This is the first I'm <u>hearing</u> of--
It's not true.
I've seen it.
They're saying you killed that policeman.
How's the trout?
It is fish.
Do you like fish?
Yeah?
Who <u>are</u> you people?
I went through this with an investigator this morning. If I could--
He didn't.
You're wrong.
If he passed me materials, I'd have them. I don't.
He didn't <u>give</u> me--
Otherwise you may have to what?
What's his name?
It's okay to use the phone.
You think there was a connection to--
We found two sets of latent prints in the rubble of Brill's studio. One was Dean's. The other, we believe, belongs to Brill.
Well...his real name's Edward Lyle.
Yes sir.
No sir.
And they have the video. That's confirmed.
If they've looked at the video.
If he's with Lyle it means he's got resources.
Isn't Zerzura supposed to be protected by spirits who take on the shape of sandstorms?
What am I looking at?
They're so untidy.  I'm just trying to rearrange them.
What else?
What do you hate most?
I just wanted you to know. I'm not missing you yet. She nods, can't find this funny.
And a good read.  Don't waste it.
I'm sorry, Katharine.
I'll be back as quick as I can. Thirty-six hours at the outside.
No, I'll get you some tea. Wait till you're in Naples.  You'll find a girl there.
Would it? She kisses him, very softly, on the lips.
I could help you.  I could get you off that.
Are you outside? A beat and then Caravaggio shuffles in.  Like an old boxer.
Why do I feel if I had your book I would know everything?
But then the Queen looked up and saw Gyges concealed in the shadows. And though she said nothing, she shuddered. The next day she sent for Gyges and challenged him.  And hearing his story, she said this -
There was a Prince, who was dying, and he was carried up the tower at Pisa so he could die with a view of the Tuscan Hills. Am I that Prince? Hana laughs.
This is Captain McGann.
Hana was just telling me that you were indifferent -
I'll get another tin. Hana and the Patient are alone.
Will you come with me?
I mean home.  India.
I know - here I am always a brown man, there you would be always a white woman.
It's what I've learned.
Whoa - give me a chance!
Certainly not.
You didn't answer the beeper either.
I don't recall authorizing you to have a personal life.
I've been following this guy for years. I'm your best shot.
You have a car?
I've got something for you.
You want me to pick up a painting?
I'm not here to run errands. I'm here for the Mask.
Motorcycle.
Why are we in separate--you know, separate rooms?
Nice try. Everyone thinks I did.
I wondered who'd been giving me a bad name.
True enough.
All this, this is a woman's version of what you would like.
Certainly the most beautiful crook I've ever seen.
Ready?
What?
Insidious thing, wondering if your partner...has another partner.
It's taken me five years at Webber Insurance, nights, weekends, every spare minute, to make this CD. It has all the necessary instructions and confirmation codes to tell their computer to transfer reasonably modest sums out of thousands of those accounts, two, or three million at a crack. Total, eight billion and change.
Every wire transfer gets rocketed through a series of multiple switches. As soon as each deposit lands somewhere, it's shot somewhere else. It ends up so clean the Mafia couldn't find it.
Nope. The CD instructs the computer to replace those instructions with an innocuous loan coded XJ-6.
You shouldn't have.
Jesus God, it's going through.
What's wrong.
The porta power...comm kits...got the IR/Thermo camera?
The key to success is using the right tools.
We're going to need a vacuum with a battery pack for the dust. The air filters might be wired. And a bypass hose for the AC.
If we don't bypass it, the temperature in the Mask room will change and set off the alarm. That would be inconvenient.
Tonight your league night?
... what we do in here is keep track of all the case files.  That way, at any time, we can find out a case's status -- where it is in the office, stuff like that.  We file 'em all here, alphabetically --
Whoa.  Remind me.
You shouldn't judge, Brenda.
I added air conditioning, put in the pool, made all those pillows by hand ...
It's a good day.  I feel good.
I never lied.  I may have miscalculated -- that happens sometimes, but --
I'm sorry about that.  Really.  But --
What are you doing here?
Oh, yeah?
Well, that was nice of him.  Isn't it funny how some people go out of their way to help people and others just give 'em the ax?
Now, why in the hell would you assume that?
Boy, do I know how you feel.  First time I heard that number, I said you got to be kidding me.  Forty God damn percent?
I'm the one who's injured, and this joker who sits at a desk all day is gonna walk away with almost half my reward?
Is that what I think it is?
Hey.  I like working with you.
Holy shit.  Who do they represent, God?
If you're here to fire me, your timing's lousy.
How many counts?
You know what, Erin?  I got nothing but time here.  Why don't you let me do that for you, and you can get your kids some dinner.
Masry & Vititoe, can I help you?
God damn it, Matthew.  What the hell are you doing out here?
You want my number?
Which number do you want, George?
Shit, yeah.  I got numbers coming out of my ears.  Like, for instance, ten.
Sure.  That's one of my numbers.  It's how many months old my little girl is.
What are you doing here?
I'm bored, and so are the kids.
Hello?
I don't do favors for you anymore.
Know what I always thought I wanted outta life, Erin?  A Jaguar.
I thought if I could spend that kinda money on a car, it'd mean everything else was fine.  I don't even know how much they cost.
You know that thing it says in here about rashes?
My lord.
I can't ...
Well, it's been awhile.
Okay, Chewie, it's now or never.
The night storms will start before you can reach the first marker.
I think we're in trouble.
.... I'm afraid there's not much left.
Droid of some kind.  I didn't hit it that hard.  It must have had a self-destruct ....
Asteroids!  Chewie, bank left, let's find out where they're coming from ...
Let's hope so ... it's just the chance we need.
Sometimes, maybe ... occasionally, when you aren't acting like a scoundrel.
Sharp bank, Chewie.  Let's turn this bucket around.  You heard me, turn around!  Full power on the front shield.
No thanks.
That ship saved my life a few times.  It's the fastest hunk of machinery in the galaxy.  What's wrong with her?
Hello!  What have we here?  Welcome, I am Baron Lando Calrissian, Administrator of this facility ... and who might you be?
You'd better know what you're doing, or this is going to get very messy.
Have they analyzed the one that was killed?
Artoo, you did it!  I never doubted you for a second ...
I will not fail you.  I'm not afraid.
Ben?  Ben?
My mind fills with so many images.
I see a city in the clouds.
I see them! ... They're in pain ... they're suffering.
The Hoth System?
To a lot of psychiatric small talk --
Somehow during the tour, she came into possession of a prototype transmitting device. We don't know how.
Where is he?
Wait a minute. I know that voice.  You're Carjack Malone.
Wait a minute, what are you talkin' about?
Maybe. But you're not putting any shit in me this time.
It's the President, for Christ's sake!
Where are they going?
Say, you need anything, Snake? Guns? Explosives? I can get you a crate of hellfire grenades, no problem - five hours.
Snake - what is it?
All of us?
Sir, your rage has unbalanced you. It seems you would fight to the death against a knight who is not your enemy, for a length of road you can ride around.
My salvation is to die a Knight of the Round Table.
It's just that I have no experience, and no men to speak of. How can I--
At your service, sir.
The very spear that pierced the side of Christ as he died on the cross.
He must stay for the feasting days of our wedding, and tell his deeds himself.
Why didn't he kill us?
They do.
I swear it. By Excalibur and the holy--
It's a stylized ritual in which rabbis or priests try to drive out the so-called invading spirit. It's pretty much discarded these days, except by the Catholics who keep it in the closet as a sort of embarrassment. It has worked, in fact, although not for the reason they think, of course. It was purely the force of suggestion. The victim's belief in possession helped cause it; and just in the same way this belief in the power of exorcism can make it disappear.
I'm gonna miss you.
But it's clean?
A disorder of the nerves. At least we think it is. We don't know yet exactly how it works, but it's often seen in earl adolescence. She shows all the symptoms: the hyperactivity; the temper; her performance in math.
So, how'd a shrink ever get to be a priest?
Where?
You're a friend of Father Dyer, right?
Pretty close?
Did he tell you about my party?
About my daughter?
He didn't mention?
Didn't tell you of what she did?
Priests keep pretty tight mouthed then?
On what?
I mean, what if a person, let's say, was a criminal, like maybe a murderer or something, you know? If he came to you for help, would you have to turn him in?
You wouldn't.
And how do you go about getting an exorcism?
If a person was possessed by a demon of some kind, how do you go about getting an exorcism?
I didn't get you?
Oh yeah, since when?
Is she gonna die?
Regan, why are you reading that?
It's not even a good picture. Looks to mature.
Over behind the church, you know where I mean over there, it's a red brick wing?
What goes down there? I mean who's the priest I keep seeing, he's there all the time. He has black hair and he's very intense looking?
Karras.
Do you like films?
I get passes. In fact I got a pass for The Crest tomorrow night. Would you like to go?
Withering Heights.
Heathcliff, Jackie Gleason, and in the role of Catherine Earnshaw, Lucille Ball.
Another one. Had your lunch?
Ydob eht ni mraw si ti! Uoy ees I! Tseirp a si eh! Emit su evig! Nirrem! Nirrem!
Save me o' God by thy name, by thy might defend my cause, proud men have risen up against me, men of violence seek my life, but God is my helper, the Lord sustains my life and every need he has delivered to me, glory be to the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.
Save your servant
Be unto her o' Lord a fortified tower.
What is it?
Can you give her something?
I cast you out!!! Unclean spirit...!
...in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ!!! It is he who commands you! He who flung you from the heights of Heaven to the depths of hell!
...Be gone!!
Trunks?
Oh. No. Strictly dryland.
Maybe next time.
Just the same.
What do you say we go for a walk, pal.
Come on, friend.  I can smell it on you. Get yourself a cup of coffee.  You'll forget what you're angry about.
You're a real tough guy when the ladies are around, aren't you, Ace?
Great.  Terrific.  Glad you could make it.
How we ... ? What, are you kidding me?
That's not the point.
You cannot continue to walk in at the last moment, Jack.
Jack.
Jack.
What d'ya got?,
So you'll come out, right?
What are you, crazy?
What's there to talk about?  She can sing. That puts her at the head of the class. That makes her the only one in the class.
You're getting cold feet about this.
Oh, brother.
November.  '71.
Day.  Wednesday.
What's the matter with you?
How dare you say you love me.
They were simple songs.
Stay off it.
You weren't there.
Fuck you.
Jesus, when was the last time we played the Mallory?
Right.  It was someone's birthday. Halloran?
Christ, that's right.  How could I forget.  What a nightmare.
You're an hour and a half late.
What's the problem?
The switch.  Hit the switch.
You play all these places?
Jesus, you fellas've made a lot of noise.  What's with the stars?
Virgins?
What's with you two?
Terrific, boys.  Really.  Terrific.
Yes, sir.  You're just what we needed on a night like this.
No, I, uh, left a dog here this morning. He needed some work on his mouth.
Yeah, yeah, I know.  I was just passing by. Thought I'd check in on him.
Where's egghead?
Relax.  We'll drop the song.
They'd been out dancing all night and he took her to the train station -- she lived over in Brookhaven.  Usually held ride with her, but this time he didn't.  Anyway, he starts walking home, only as he's walking he starts getting nervous.
By the time he gets to the corner newstand, he's got her meeting some rich guy on the train, the rich guy's asked her to marry him, and he's reading about it in the morning edition.
He had a mind that escalated things.
Jack.
I tried Cheerios this morning. He didn't even get up. Maybe they took out the wrong teeth.
Waxy Wright.  Didn't Jon Archer bust you for poisoning five members of the Canadian parliament?
Perfect fit.
Do you know what it is to be in a coma?  It fucks up everything -- including your memory! I can't even tell you why Dobbs jumped me yesterday!
I don't know.  Everything's jumbled -- so you're going to have to help me fill in a few blanks.
Who is this?
Okay, you're having an emotional crisis.  You need to seek the help of a trained --
Whoever you are, don't call again.
We can send in a plant -- try to get Pollux to spill the location.
You killed them?
What are you going to do, Castor?
SFPD?  Castor isn't stupid enough to come back to the city.
You picked a helluva day to leave your beeper off!
Castor's escaped!
You'll need to recultivate that virus.
I think -- you're trying to get me drunk.
I'm going to the powder room.
You think I like being here on Christmas Eve, Alan?
...thats our war room. We did seven major deals last year, three of them hostile.
They did a pretty good job.
The aliens...In the mother ship.  You look just like him.
I know, I moved the Barca-lounger into the corner.  Its throwin everybody off.  What do you think?
So Jack, its your wifes birthday, got anything to say to her?
So you're telling me, you've got a gun to your head and you don't think for one second, what if this, what if that, maybe I shouldn't do this, I shoulda done that.
Look, I dont know what youre getting so worked up about, you did this...you brought this on yourself.
No?  Cmon, Jack...Ive got everything I need, I dont have regrets, thats just not for me... sound familiar?
...06...14...18...48...right there.  Four numbers...that's two hundred and thirty eight dollar...  Merry Christmas and shit...
What're you talkin' about?
Merry Christmas to you, sir...
I have a bad feeling about this.
Yes, Im fine.  Its just this god awful football phone!  Who has a phone like this anyway?!
How can you do that?
How was the game, honey?
You really are incredible...
Imagine having a life where everything was easy...where you asked for things and people just brought them to you...
Youre talking to their new Vice President of Mergers and Acquisitions.
Whats going on?
...were really more of a boutique operation, as you can see...
I have to go to my parents' house out in Jersey.  Would you like to come?
I don't think She's real big on hate.
He <u>knew</u> about NASA.  What if he made the call to shut us down --
Maybe you should think about <u>yourself</u> for once.  You always let this guy push you round --
What?  Come on.  She's got a good thing with Victor --
He's smart, powerful, successful --
Ben, I've been crunching the numbers on the machine.  I think if we can rework the power settings...
I'll be watching over you.
He couldn't generate enough power for the machine to reach critical mass. Yet another mistake for "Mr. Fantastic."
Your tissue, your organs, your entire biophysical structure is changing. Every system is still functioning, somehow --
I don't really know.  A compound organic-metallic alloy.  Stronger than titanium or carbon steel.  Harder than diamonds --
At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --
We should stay here until we can define the extent of our changes...
Me like-y.
I though we went over this.
I'm driving.
Leonard, how's the feed?
Got it.  So take a walk, Ben...I'm going to borrow Susan for a second.
Those solar winds are flaring, but I factored them into my coordinates and --
What?
What are you doing?
When I walked out, I waited <u>ten</u> <u>minutes</u> outside your door.  Ten. Waiting for you to come find me.
Victor, your scar --
I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --
Where do we stand?
I told you to cut down on the sugar.
But why take the chance, when there must be other doctors?
Yes, we'd like to get moving.
Doctor...
That could be quite a lethal weapon... It could kill, not cure.
I understand you've been Dr. Duval's Assistant for quite some time... He must've snatched you out of the cradle.
A long time, with one man.
Open it! Open it before they get here!
Nothing miraculous about it. Just an interchange of gases. The end product of five hundred million years of Evolution.
I'd hate to get lost on that Freeway...
We need you for Security purposes, Mr. Grant.
They know they failed to kill Benes. Security thinks they'll try again, first chance they get. We're afraid of medical sabotage -- or surgical assassination.
In a way -- yes. Those are impurities imbedded in the Lung after a lifetime of 'Civilization.' Carbon from smoke and smog -- specks of dust --
They're tracking us Topside. Once they see where we're going, I'm sure they'll take every precaution.
If it's no military secret, how can a sub run on a microscopic particle?
That's cutting it mighty close -- for a perfect fit.
Thirty-two minutes left...  But chances are we won't have to wait that long for try-number three.
Doctor -- the channel's getting awful narrow.
The Wall's transparent...
... What is he, deaf?... So, uh, how long have you been with the escort service?
Ya find the work interesting, do ya?
...You c'n'ave my truck. I'm takin' a Shiera.
One hunnert's the best we can do here.
Well, the little guy, he was kinda funny-looking.
I dunno. Just funny-looking.
I couldn't really say. He wasn't circumcised.
Yah.
Uh-huh.
No. Like I say, he was funny-looking. More'n most people even.
We're not horse-trading here, Wade, we just gotta bite the bullet on this thing.
What's the next step here, Jerry?
...Mr. Lundegaard?
Yah. Yah. Home a Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox.
Yah, ya know we've got the big statue there. So you haven't had any vehicles go missing, then?
...Dad?
Where're you going?
What the heck were you thinkin'? Heck, if I'm only gettin' bank interest, I'd look for complete security. Heck, FDIC. I don't see nothin' like that here.
Okay, so we got a state trooper pulls someone over, we got a shooting, and these folks drive by, and we got a high-speed pursuit, ends here, and this execution-type deal.
I'd be very surprised if our suspect was from Brainerd.
...You can sleep, hon. It's early yet.
Nope.
Yep.
Nope.
...Chief Gunderson?
Yes, ma'am. Are we the closest PD?
Uh-huh.
And his wife?
Geez. Looks like this thing goes higher than we thought. You call his home?
Oh, my.
Boy, this thing is really... geez.
This was a support group for men with testicular cancer.  The big moosie slobbering all over me was Bob.
Yes.  We're men.  Men is what we are.
Let's pretend.  You're the Department of Transportation, and you discover that our company intentionally did nothing about leather seats cured in third world countries with chemicals we know cause birth defects?  Brake linings that fail after a thousand miles.  Fuel injectors that burn people alive.
It becomes an addiction.
Picture yourself watching Marla Singer throw herself around her crummy apartment.
This could go on for hours.
Well, that's a relief.  Thank you.
I don't want to hear anything you've got to say.
Sixty seconds, then I'm out of here.
What happened... ?
-- But, in here, in everyone, there's the squint of a five-day headache. Yet they forced themselves to be positive.  They never said "parasite;" they said "agent."  They always talked about getting better.
You see, when you travel, everything is small, self-contained--
Thank you.
What?
Well, uh... great.
I don't know about this.
No.  That's a good thing, isn't it?
What are you reading?
You want to finish her off?
... Marla ... ?
Hey.
This conversation...
You could be standing under 37 stories of steel and concrete with a 150 gallons of nitroglycerin strapped to the support... oh, maybe it couldn't be...
What a ridiculous thing to say.
...go through with this? What are you going to do?
...stop me?
...to let this happen!
One minute.
This is the beginning.  We're at ground zero.  Maybe you should say a few words, to mark the occasion.
Do something for me.
Appreciate something.
Look at me...
Biology, mostly.
I... I don't know...
You have to tell us now.
No!  It can't be.
So if you never got off the plane, none of us would be alive in the first place.
You've made your point.
What?
Here's what I don't get.  For nine months, Death does all this shit to make sure I win these tickets and end up on Route 18 at exactly the right time for the pile up...
Pigeons... It's a sign!  If Clear's right about the order, then Nora and Tim are going to be attacked by Pigeons!
Um, Kimberly?  This is a neighborhood. You may wanna slow it down.
This trip better be worth it. What's the guy-girl ratio again?
I know this is the first time we've been apart since.  But everything's gonna be okay.
Mom?
Ahhh! fuck! You fucking asshole. You think this is funny, you fucking dick? Tod, if you're not dead I'm gonna fucking kill you!
I can't go home. After Lewton's, they'll be after me.
Hope you don't think, Browning, that because my name ain't on this wall... that I owe you anything.
Me, too.  But my dad doesn't understand. When he's better; you and me, road trip to the City. Catch the Yanks.
And don't pass on the right.
Hey, man, why'd you say that?!
You guys are real... aren't you?
Sorry, I mean... I talk to people all the time... I know a lot of them aren't there.  But this is real, isn't it?  You're taking me home now?
Co Phuong Bao.  The guide takes us twelve klicks upriver to target at Ban... at Ban... Bo Peep.  Shit!
That's it?  Some C-4, a map and a knife?
How you doing, Brewer?
Can you handle the door gun?
Are you okay?
Why'd they want us?
Stay on your heading, Captain.
That's an order.
You think they'll find any?
Black.  No sugar.
What's your name?
This will last you one year after which you have the option to renew if... you like at a membership discount.
You know, let me tell you something! I'm not that kind of person. I don't do people favors. If I talk to you it's because I want to. So we're not all ...uh...Jerri Hall...Big deal... What a boring world if we were. You do the best you can with what you got. You're not so so invisible, ya know... You want make an impression? Try this; you can be a real bitch.
It happens to be a beautiful love story.  Ya know, you used to like that about me.  You used to say you liked that I didn't make you think so much.  That we could be together and not think...
I was not with a woman last night.  I was out with Parry.
He's not a moron.
Lydia is the girl Parry likes... And I thought, if I could get them together I...
I... You're not going to understand this.
All right... Sorry... I feel indebted to him.
See, I told you!
Ugh, these tapes are a mess.  I don't know where to begin...
So, Edwin, baby, this is Sunrise Confession time... what have you got for us?
Remember. One chorus and out.
Hello. My name is Lydia Sinclair.
Have I died?
I'm not married.
...You are such a great guy. First the money, now this.  Isn't he fabulous!?
You can't do this! This is New York! Nobody lies in naked in a field in New York..It's...it's too Midwestern.
You a fag too?
We mostly publish trashy romance novels.
If you're sayin' you're somethin' better'n what I am, that's one thing. But I can't say much a someone who'd run off an' leave a woman in a situation like this an' feel easy about it. An' that's all I gotta say.
Is it my turn again?
Just one minute, you! Don't you ever talk to me like that!
Come on.
Fantastic! That you could figure all that out, and lay that down on her, to come up with a way you could get your toast.
Oh my goodness... Bobby...
Well...  I better let you...
Well, you're not going to run out on me right away, are you?
Bye, now.
That was beautiful, Robert. I'm surprised...
No inner feeling.
And living out here, in this rest home asylum, that's what you want?
That'll make you happy.
That's three games to none, Carl.
What's wrong, Carl, you hardly ate anything...
And you know, I read where they invented this car that runs on... that runs on... when you boil water...
Who are you?
Come down!
I gotta go take a piss.
You sure? She's got kind of like brown hair.
You sure?
My friend told me she lived around here.
Maybe tonight?
That's what he said.
I don't know how he doesn't know. He doesn't know.
Wonder who his supplier is.
I wasn't asking.
I think that's highly unlikely, Creasy.
Creasy, how old are you?
Can I call my Mom? I'd like to tell here how much I've always loved her.
So where do you know Alan from?
Really. The California Racquet Club?
That's my club too. I haven't seen you there.
Right, and how long have you had these pains, Mr. Barber?
Two bs?
That's two.
Arnold Babar. Isn't there a children's book about an elephant named Babar?
No children?
Refusal to pay alimony is a jailable offense, Fletch.
I did not break nor enter. I simply chose an advisable location to await my client's delinquent husband.
Bravo, Mr. Fletcher.
He sighs.
Where does the Chief get the drugs?
Rio de Janeiro, maybe?
That's Brazil.
Will you kill me?
I overheard it. He thinks you're completely out of control, he said he was gonna can you as soon as he got the story. If I were you, I'd just chuck it, Fletch. Screw him. Let him eat three full pages on Sunday.
I just thought... sure.  Sally Ann Cavanaugh.
What's he doing in Utah?
Thanks for the great time.
I've never lied to him before.  It's the first time he's ever lied to me. He was just as convincing as when he says 'I love you.'
Oh God, I hate things that start like that....
Excuse me. I have something I'd like to discuss with you.
Just kidding, Frank. You'll have the story and you'll be damn proud of it.
And, I'm sorry, who are you again?
Who's Frieda?
No thanks.  I carry my own.
That was close...
Your tip paid off.  Jazz, this is Sam the Sleazebag.  Sam the Sleazebag, this is Jazz, my secretary.
All your friends call you Jazz.
You going to be okay?
I came to warn you...
A simple 'please' would suffice...
Let's watch some 'M.T.V.'
Pretty smooth, huh?
Fairlane, you gonna find out who killed the lead singer of Black Vomit?
It's me.
Hey, I love you, too, you little jerk.  Jesus, guy tries to make a commitment and he's gotta eat shit.
How's it going?
The point?
It doesn't have to be like this?
You're that guy, the private eye.
Do you really know everybody in the industry?
That's cute.  You're funny.
You heard that Bobby Vomit O.D.'d, right?  Do you suspect foul play and stuff?
Did I say you could move that hand -- I'm not gonna get stuck am I?
Allo... Salvatore...
Sale boulot.
Il est en retard.
Une erreur!  C'est gnial.  C'est une vedette  la tlvision.  Il peut aller partout sans tre souponn... En plus il a besoin de fric.
I'm sorry, I don't know who you mean.
Christ you should o' collared him right there.
I make at least two junk connections at that table in the corner.  The guy is the stripe combo, I know him too.
We got information that there's no shit in the street -- it's like a desert full of junkies with a big score coming in to make everybody well.
My ass.  The only reason you're in this is because you've got a big expense account for buying junk and you like to see your picture in the papers.
So whatta you want a badge?  It's your first major league game Sal. One thing I learned, move calmly, move cautiously.  You'll never be sorry.
Which is why your phone lines are tapped and the Feds are crawlin' all over you like flies.
Frank.  Hey, man.  You alright?
Frankie, Johnny wants to say goodnight.
Hey, bud.
What if I could prove it to you, Satch?
What if I told you that in the bottom of the 6th we're gonna be down 3-0.  And Cleon Jones is gonna get hit in the foot. It's gonna leave a scuff mark on the ball.
The next batter, Clendenon, hits one outta the park.
In the bottom of the 7th, Weis is gonna hit a solo home run.  Jones and Swoboda are gonna score in the 8th.  The Mets are gonna win 5-3.  Go watch the game, Satch.
Are you licensed to broadcast, buddy?
Listen, you can't broadcast without a license.  Unless this is an emergency, you gotta get off the band.
What the hell...
You're still my Little Chief, right?
When?
John, say hello to my wife...Julia.
John, you there?
My father didn't die in a fire?
My father didn't die in a fire?
Cancer.  It was the cigarettes.  Right? The cigarettes?
That's what we need here, Satch.  A lucky break.
Hey, future boy.  Frank tells me you're a cop?
Who the fuck is this?
Sullivan?
Fuck you, asshole.
So what would a weekend in the country be without sex?
What're you doin'?
Here.  Go down the cellar and check the fusebox.
Look what I found.  Remember these?
No.  I got here just before you did.
Goldilocks and the Three Bears?
Hi.
Got any good ideas?
I thought that was the end of the song.
Don't worry about it.  Just stay cool.
You become a whole other person when you're out here, Stan.  And I don't like it.
No.  No, it's not...
Are you sure this is gonna work? I mean, why didn't we bring that gun and just blast him away?
Lake Forest Green?
But what if they try and scare us?
Aren't you the kid whose mother and friends were....
And you've been at some psychiatric clinic ever since, haven't you?
You got me where you want me. There's no reason not...
Anything else?
Jesus!
She's beautiful.
I'll be back later.  You just be cool, okay.
Don't do anything stupid.
I'm gonna get your outta this.  Just hang tight.  Okay?
I hear the crew members are cute guys in their twenties.
What's wrong?
She never should've set foot on this ship. This is your fault!
You have no right...
She doesn't know what she wants. She's never had a stable life.
I'm her legal guardian, not you or anybody else, and I alone know what's best for her. End of discussion.
Everyone split up -- we'll cover more ground that way.
Get in the boat, Rennie!
When did this start?
I think so. But we have to lower the anchors so we don't drift any further...
We must abandon.
Very dangerous.
We must abandon.
We were thinking of putting in a pool.
What?
I used to tell myself. Talent is more erotic when it's wasted. Will I see you tonight?
Look. I'm sorry you keep running into dishonest men. But you're only eighteen. We can still turn it around.
Am I really so deeply repugnant?
Life is good.
We must have been heroic.
Lillian says it once a week. `Why doesn't he come live with us?'
I do know the answer to that. Why don't we watch the ball game later? We'll go to Mannion's.
Of course they're gonna lose. We'll watch them lose. What good is heartbreak if we don't experience it firsthand?
It's a complicated subject.
They're my team, too. I grew up on Boyleston Street. Right by Fenway Park. I went to fifty or sixty games a year. All by myself. I was one of those kids with scabby elbows. I called out to the players. `Look over here. Hi, I'm Steven. My parents are divorced.'
The Red Sox were my world. I surrendered my existence to a team that couldn't win the big one.
Yessiree, Bob.
He feels he has to defend himself if necessary.
Please! You're being foolish!
Just an admirer...
They're calling you "Bapu." I thought it meant father.
What can we do?
And you've come all this way because you think something is going to happen?
The honor is ours. May I introduce Mr. Kallenbach. He's an old friend  and his interest is in flowers. I presumed to tell him he could wander your gardens while we talked.
In England, I was a poor student but I --
I'm glad to hear you say that... very glad. You see if we repeal the Act under pressure  under this kind of pressure it will create a great deal of resentment. Can you understand that?
He was right. It's insane -- anything would have been better.
I'm sorry, there's no way we can.
Of course.  He's a "de-gene-erate".  He works at Gattaca.  Why else would we find the eyelash near the washroom?  Nobody stops to take a leak during a murder.
Would you care to look--in the telescope?
One look through there and you would know why I can't possibly allow you to disrupt operations any further.
Right now, <i>your</i> presence is creating more of a threat.  I don't think you have any concept of what we do here--how meticulous our preparations must be.  We are about to send twelve people through 140 million miles of blackness to rendezvous with an object the size of a house and the color of coal.  So it's rather critical to point them in the right direction. And we certainly don't need you looking over our shoulders.  Besides, I don't believe there is any evidence that the killer <i>is</i> amongst us.  I don't see too many other dead bodies littering the place.
I don't know exactly, Jerome.
I gotta stop!!  I gotta stop!!
You really had other offers?
Why have you done this?
Where are you going?
Yeah.
Why are you inventing problems?  You two are a couple of goddam clones.  You look so right together, I want to double my fee.
You didn't know?
You're angry--
What is it?
The doctor will give you something.
Three... Rudy got ambitious.
Feel good?
Where do you want to go?
I'll be okay.
Really?
Promise you won't laugh.
I feel like the night before the first day of school.
There better be a guy with the
From now on you just shut up and do as you're told.
We better stick here till tonight.
Come on, come on.
Hope you get to where you're going.
I guess you ain't gonna shoot me, are you?
Something ought to loosen him up ... how comes we're going to El Paso, Rudy?
You know what the bloody time is!  It's two o'clock in the bloody morning!
No, don't Jack, don't.
You know Sid Fletcher?
You know Sid Fletcher?
Do you?
That's why you waited for me.
You sure about that?
Where you going to live, then?
Where's that?
See you later.
What is it?
Is he staying the night?
So shut up.
You wouldn't.
'Cos I know you wear purple underwear.
What's it to you anyway?
That's not always a healthy way to be...
Gerald phoned us in the middle of the night, said he'd heard you've been making a nuisance of yourself.
What's that?
Three hundred altogether?
It's not.
How many leads have we got?
And you're saying a fella could take and sell these leads to Jerry Graff.
How do you know he'd buy them?
You haven't talked to him.
Yes.  It is, George.  Yes.  It's a big decision.  And it's a big reward.  It's a big reward.  For one night's work.  But it's got to be tonight.
What?  What?  The leads.
That's right, the guys are moving them downtown.  After the thirtieth. Murray and Mitch.  After the contest.
You...
I, you know, they should be insured.
Will you excuse...
Will you excuse us please?
What?
Fuck insured.  You owe me a car.
Shelly...
What about the other two?
Four.  You had four leads.  One kicked out, one the judge, you say...
...no...
...no...
...I only...
What are we going to say?
I'm not sure I have two.
I've got Roma.  Then I've got Moss...
Alright.
How could I tell 'em your sale?  Eh? I don't have a tel...I'll tell 'em your sale when they bring in the leads.  Alright?  Shelly.  Alright? We had a little... You closed a deal.  You made a good sale.  Fine.
Look: I have a lot of things on my mind, they're coming in, alright, they're very upset, I'm trying to make some sense...
The only thing remarkable is who you made it to.
That if the sale sticks, it will be a miracle.
What?
"You do get the..."  Huh?  Huh?
"You do get the opportunity...You get them.  As I do, as anyone does..."
Fuck you, Dave...
You're sure?
Well, Ray was eating at one of his company's men's home in France...the man's French, isn't he?
Ah.  Ah, his wife is.  Ray: what time do you have...?
Oh!  My God...I've got to get you on the plane!
No.  You said the one.  That's why you said we couldn't talk till Kenilworth.
I've got to talk to you.
I'm very sorry, Jimmy.  I apologize to you.
What is?
Fuckin' asshole.
Cop couldn't find his dick two hands and a map.  Anyone talks to this guy's an asshole...
They didn't get the contracts.
They got, listen to me...
...I wouldn't worry about it.
What took so long?
Goddamn bitch.
Ten to one shot, you said.  Ten to one shot in my favor, and I lose.
My life won't be worth a nickel after tomorrow.
Mikey, why would they ever hit poor old Frankie Five-Angels?  I loved that ole sonuvabitch.  I remember when he was just a 'button,' when we were kids.  We used to put bedsheets on our heads, you know, like we were ghosts.  An' ole Frankie come peek into our room, we'd jump up, and he'd always pretend like he was really scared. You remember?
You?  What do you mean you, I thought...
You?  What do you mean you, I thought...
No.  I mean, are you sure?
The 'patrone' is here.
Rocco!
Goddamn it, where were you?
Did the boy get something from me for Christmas?
What was it, so I'll know.
We've never sent this much with one courier.
There's thirty grand worth of paid off markers -- I never owed that much.
You paid off thirty grand I never owed.
And what's the price of their not finding out.
I had no idea...
Where?
Why don't you sit down?
There are a lot of things I want to talk to you about.  Things I've been thinking about -- changes I want to make.
Why too late?
His brother came to help him.
On a plane back to Sicily.
That's all.  You see, in Sicily, in the old days... there was only one legitimate reason to kill a blood relative... only one.  IF he was a traitor.
If only I could live to see it, kid; to be there with you.  How beautifully we've done it, step by step.  Here, protected, free to make our profits without the Justice Department, the FBI; ninety miles away in partnership with a friendly government.  Ninety miles, just a small step, looking for a man who desperately wants to be President of the United States, and having the cash to make it possible.
They asked him to sign paper to take down the markers; but he got mad; told them to wait until he was finished.
Senator Geary, I speak to you as a businessman who has made a large investment in your state.  I have made that state my home; plan to raise my children here.  The license fee from the Gambling Commission costs one thousand dollars; why would I ever consider paying more?
Here is the six month's increase in advance.  You needn't speak to her about it, she's a proud woman.  See me again in another six months. But of course, you'll let her keep her dog.
What's that mean?
I wasn't going to try anything.
No.  You are a guest now.  You go in the living room.
Good morning.
My name is Whale.  This is my house.
And your name is --?
I couldn't help but notice your tattoo.  That phrase?  Death Before Dishonor.  What does it mean?
All right then.  Sure.  I could use the extra dough.
How are you, Mr. Boone?  So glad you are free for lunch.
Oh dear.  I <u>have</u> made you nervous.
The extras are in their places. Now we need the star.  Wouldn't you like to get in the pool?
Good afternoon, Clayton.
It's not like her.
Certainly you have better things to do than babysit an old man?
You know what he did when I called him?  He laughed.  He laughed so hard he practically burst a blood vessel.  Said it was a good lesson for me.  Not to try to fill his shoes.
Them's the breaks, right?  No war stories for this pup.
Just take off the fucking mask!
I liked it.  You learn stuff listening to old-timers.
She tells me you haven't been sleeping well.
Then take the pills.
Uh-oh.  The way you look at me, James.  What have you done this time?
Which ones?  I bring them all.
Who was that at the door?
Yes?
Just like going swimming, isn't it?
Okay.  "Frankenstein."  Tell me everything.
What are you doing here?
Jesus, man ... What'd you do?
I don't want them hurt. Any of 'em...
I know you --
You want to come along quiet?
Leg's all banged-up. He made a stupid play ... He'll limp around the yard up at Folsom. But Astricky will be there to take care of him. With their priors, they're looking at a serious bounce --
How's that?
You'll leave -- ?
I want you gone, Randall. Settle your affairs. Make it right with those you love. Hell, take 'em with you. But I want you out of here. Out of here for good this time ...
I'll catch you later, Randall --
Diane 1.
Yeah.
No. That was Higgins ....
Jesus. The whole damn thing's loaded.
Have you seen him?
oh.
Breakfast brunch -- ?
It's good to see ya, man. You changed your look -
What happened to you?
Too early to tell. Nervous?
That's strange. I'm nervous. Donny's nervous. Everyone's nervous. But not you...
Thirteen down ... Thirty-seven to go ...
Jim Rockford. ROCKFORD FILES.
What the hell are you doing -- ?
No whistles, but a Club You bring a hack -- ?
Where to -- ?
I remember I had a 1964 Buick Opal. worst car ever built. Value job. Everything broke and I-fixed it. A coma car - built to German specs. Plastic gas line. 3 speedometer head. On a quiet night, you could hear it rusting in the garage. But when that car was gone, I missed it. If it came driving back in here right now, there'd be tears and laughter ...
She's not. Carroll Shelby tweaked the Mustang's High-Performance 289 engine and got it legally rated for the street at 450 horsepower ... But its actual output is closer to 600 ...
You think I don't know? You think I like to keep this inside? But I gotta, or he'll kill the miserable bastard and he'll be there for life. It's disgusting what you have to put up with.
What? What happened?
But he was always a bad kid, that one.
Here. Take it.  Now I gotta turn my back on you.
I don't care. Something's going on.
Jimmy's calling every day. It's urgent.
At least Jimmy and Mickey want to help. I talk to Mickey every day. That's more than I can say for the rest.
we're gonna feed the bastard to the lions.
I didn't agree to three points over the vig.- What am I nuts? I didn't need it that much.
Do you realize what we're involved in here now?
He didn't call?
What kind of person doesn't call?
If he was so grown up he'd get you two an apartment.
--Yah, restructurin' the amount of retards they had workin' for them.
Jesus, that's really bad, did anyone even order a Flyin' Fish?
Suck my crank. Fuckin' sheet metal pussy.  So, when are you done with those meetin's?
Are they hookin' you up with a job?
Yah, but it's better than this shit. At least you'd make some nice bank.
It's a way outta here.
Look, you're my best friend, so don't take this the wrong way, but in 20 years, if you're livin' next door to me, comin' over watchin' the fuckin' Patriots' games and still workin' construction, I'll fuckin' kill you. And that's not a threat, that's a fact. I'll fuckin' kill you.
Listen, you got somethin' that none of us have.
Fuck you. You owe it to me. Tomorrow I'm gonna wake up and I'll be fifty and I'll still be doin' this. And that's all right 'cause I'm gonna make a run at it. But you, you're sittin' on a winning lottery ticket and you're too much of a pussy to cash it in. And that's bullshit 'cause I'd do anything to have what you got! And so would any of these guys. It'd be a fuckin' insult to us if you're still here in twenty years.
I guess so.
Is this a bad time?
Okay.
Would you shut the fuck up! I know what you ordered, I was there!
What do you mean "your sandwhich?" I bought it.
How much money you got?
Well give me your fuckin' change and we'll put your fuckin' sandwhich on lay-away.
What's up guys?
To tell you the truth, I wasn't there much. The class was rather elementary.
Well, if something was stolen, I should know about it.
Please, I'm a professor here and it's very important.
Get out, Will.
Yes.
Yeah.
He married his cousin.
I called Mel Weintraub this morning, to check for availability.
What do you want to do?
Who is he?
I might understand that.
What?
That's very presumptuous.
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I'm married and I have two children.
You're getting defensive, Will.
Who is "Danny Terrio?"
So what's with this place? You have a swan fetish? Is this something you'd like to talk about?
No.
Why thank you.
No.
They're all dead.
But you can't give back to them, Will.
That's what I'm saying, Will. You'll never have that kind of relationship in a world where you're afraid to take the first step because all you're seeing are the negative things that might happen ten miles down the road.
Don't give me you line of shit.
It's not about that job. I'm not saying you should work for the government. But, you could do anything you want. And there are people who work their whole lives layin' brick so their kids have a chance at the kind of opportunity you have. What do you want to do?
Nobody gets what they ask for, Will. That's a cop-out.
No. Thank you.
Oh, you will?
You men are shameful. If you're not thinking of your weiner then you're acting on its behalf.
Take care.
Ain't you gonna look back, Ma?--give the ol' place a last look?
That don't sound like you, Ma. You never was like that before.
Maybe the road's out.
House 25. Number's on the door.
Two and a half cents.
Take it or leave it. There's 200 men coming from the South that'll be glad to get it.
Look, I didn't set the price. I'm just working here. If you want it, take it. If you don't, turn right around and beat it.
This is Muley Graves.  You remember the preacher, don't you?
Can't tell if you hear it or not. You hear it, Tom?
You people got a lotta nerve.
Crossin' the desert in a jalopy like this.
Sure, plenty, but not in no wreck like this.
Well, maybe. But I'd hate to be doin' it. Takes more nerve than I got.
How 'bout Granma?
Anybody ask anything?
Know where we're a-goin'?
She shore don't look prosperous. Want to go somewheres else?
She's gettin' prettier, Ma.
What was the use. He was right. There wasn't a thing in the world I could do about it.
Here we go!
But what does *that* prove?
Now you done it! You busted it!
Bob. Bob Destephano.
I'm Dan. Dan Koretzky.
Yeah... Hey, I saw you at your dad's dealership the other day.
I just play my own collection.
Hello...?
You're fucking psycho.
...About five years now.
Seriously, when I left, I joined the Army and took the service exam. They found my psych results fit a certain profile. A certain "Moral flexibility" would be the best way to describe it... I was loaned out to a CIA- sponsored program. It's called "mechanical operations." We sort of found each other...
Go to your reunion, Martin. See those people and discover what they mean to you. Try not to kill anybody for a few days, see how you feel.
I want two eggs poached, hash brown well-done. English muffin for the bread. And a coffee.
Sometimes. I'm in divorce, mainly. Some property. Some personal injury.
Looks like someone keeps trying to do our job for us.
What's it look like?
You haven't looked at the dossier.
God it's great to see you.
Why not?
I'm a professional killer.
You know, we're branding here tomorrow. If you two want to come by to watch or give a hand, you're welcome.
Are you shy, Mr. Booker?
Everything under control?
Just make yourself comfortable.
Then what have we been doing? I mean what was the point?
You should call your dad before it gets too late.
Oh. You didn't tell me.
Did you ask him to come visit?
Did he mention it?
Listen, if... if there's a part of you as parent that... that takes pride in your child -- that, you can look at them and see something you've accomplished as well... if that's wrong, then I'm sorry.  But it wasn't my intention. I don't push for me. I do it for you... So you don't waste half your life feeling like you don't know where you belong.
Oh, I miss you. You look beautiful.
How's everything?
Okay. We'll see you later then.
You can hardly get your arms around me. How depressing. You're so early.
Aw... that's so sweet.
So, how are you doing in Marlboro country? Is the magazine complaining at all?
When are you coming home?
Well then... maybe I will take some time... come visit.
I have so much to tell you.
Where to?
Where does this go, Diane?
Is there anything you need? I'm going food-shopping.
Mixed salad.
When you figure on branding?
Don't you go to school?
Put the key in and turn it.  The right pedal is gas, the other one's the brake.
My parents are having friends from college over. They're really nice... They have this gorgeous son who wants to be a forest ranger.
Honey, you all right? Did something fall?
Hey, darlin'.
As you can see, this is just a simple microcassette recorder.   Hook it up to the phone and drop in five bucks in quarters.
And never again have to pay for a service that would be dirt cheap...
Right.
Snoop onto them...
Nonononono. Truce, you guys. Listen, we got a higher purpose here, alright? A wake up call for the Nintendo Generation. We demand free access to data, well, it comes with some responsibility. When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child, but when I became a man I put away childish things.  What... It's Corinthians I, Chapter 13, verse 11, no duh. Come on.
Dade?
What are you doing?
Talk to me.
They'll trace you like that  man, cops are gonna find you, they're gonna find you with a smoking gun.
What the hell are you doing?
It's too much machine for you.
Well that's great. There goes MIT.
How?
You look good in a dress.
You're welcome.
Alright. How about the Master of Disaster, huh?
So what are we supposed to do?
Rachel! What are you doing here? I thought I was supposed to pick you up?
Is there another key?
How do we look?
We'll be at the Fallbrooks. The number's next to the phone.
I'd assumed Dr. Loomis would be here.  Michael Myers was his patient.
Sure it does.
It's been eleven months.
Your lucky.  I wish she could do the same for me.
Jamie, wait for me.
Rachel, take your sister upstairs. First door on the right.
Kelly, I want you to close and lock all the downstairs windows.
132 to 133 this is 134.
This is starting to spook me.
It's over.
You're going to be late at the Doyles, Annie.
I don't see anything.
Wait a minute here...
Deal. Hey, I thought Paul was grounded.
I can't help it. It just keeps ringing.
Come on... A skunk could have killed it...
Hi, Laurie, what's up?
Is Annie around?
Well, she's totally not here.
Okay. Later.
What about the Jack-O-Lantern?
What about the rest of my comic books?
What about the bogyman?
Richie said he was coming after me tonight.
No...
Now, I want you to walk to the door, down the stairs and right out the front door.
...any sister talk?
That's just --
It's French, though.  It really is.
We got that idea on that trip to Paris.
Hmm?
Oh, it's just so romantic.  I just want to put on a long gown...
Well, I'm sorry to say you have had a significant drop in the high- decibel range of your right ear.
Are you excited about becoming a collector? DUSTY Yeah.
I got a lot more to learn, though. I really wasn't into art when I was a kid.
Oh, my goodness!
Hi.
Well, I'm-I'm looking for a bookstore.
Yes.  Yeah, I-I'm kill--
Well, yes, I'm killing time.  I have a client near here and I...I'm quite early.
How about you?
Oh, yes!  You live near here, don't you?
Where are you headed?
e.e. cummings.  I'd like to get you this.
Oh, oh, yes.  I-I-I-'d like to, uh, uh, very much.
I-I read a poem of you and thought of his last week.  A poem of  his and thought of you last--  You'll be fine, though.  Lee walks over to Elliot in the center aisle.  She looks at the book.
Yes, I'd...I-I-I'd love, I'd love to get you this.
They have a very large gay clientele, you know, where I get my teeth cleaned, and...all the hygienists now wear gloves because they're afraid of AIDS.
Your guilt is because you feel the same.
And you're in love overnight?
Lee...
Oh, let's not--I, I don't know what the hell I'm talking about.
No!
I didn't say that.
I am... I did slave all day.
Who thinks about such nonsense? Now I'm alive.  When I'm dead, I'll be dead.
Of what?  I'll be unconscious.
How do you know?
...or films you must see or... 
Mickey, Mickey, listen, listen.
You're just realizing this now?
So how are you?
Do you miss Frederick?
I can't believe Elliot and I can't think of someone nice for you to go out with, you know--
I'm okay.
How is everything?
Yeah?  Yeah?  Okay, kids, you can open the presents now.
Hannah and I...can't have any children.  Now I-I-I don't want to get into whose fault it--  It's my fault that we can't and- and-and the details are too embarrassing to--
Holly, please.  Don't insult me.
I know.  H-how much do you need?
Not this Thanksgiving, you know.
W-why?  You don't think it's realistic?
Well, that-that's good.  It just, uh...it just seems to me that-that six months or a year, if-if you spent it more productively...
Y-you mentioned to me yourself that you and Elliot were having some problems.
I'd never do that.
Oh, well, that was a long time ago.
People change...you know.
Yeah, I hope you have, too. MICKEY  I hope so for your sake, because, uh, your personality left something to be desired...
Oh, God!
Oh, wow!
Uh, gee.  Would you like to have lunch?  Uh, uh...
Okay, and listen, I would like to hear what made you suddenly decide to drop out of life.
Yeah.
I can't think.
We have to talk about <u>money</u>...
A reward...
A reward for what?
And?
...you haven't <u>found</u> him yet.
You've gone off to America, on your <u>Vacation</u>...
...<u>please</u>...
...and I want to talk to you about your <u>promotion</u>..
Then you tell me, then.
I feel...  I feel they're Out to <u>Get</u> Me...
...they're sending me.  Out to get Shot.  Hounding me.... they're... 
How crazy is that.
The identity of the person offering the bounty was never established.
He don't like popcorn.
I like Popcorn...
You give me whatever I want...?
I know you did what you could.
Give it up, Evelda.
Give it up.
Darling, Dr. Fell.  My wife Madame Pazzi.
...they eat the dummy, sir, they eat the <u>man</u>... I keep them hungry.  When... when do we think this man arrives.
Well, I don't want to starve them too long.  They die.
Thank you, Cordell.
Why should <u>you</u> care?
ARE YOU <u>DONE</u>?
You don't wish to <u>beg</u>...?
Because you're going to help me plan a party.
I'm going to do it, and you're going to catch the bouquet.
My daddy would say:  accept with glee the things you cannot change.
Mr. Crawford asked my opinion.  Here we've got a purported x-ray, Dr. Lechter's surgery.  Do we keep it secret, or broadcast it?
Yeah, that's too Hip for the Room.
I don't wanna go out there at <u>all</u>...
No.  I want to buy a dog. 
...and then, we're going to <u>Greece</u>...
Tell me why...?
Then tell me.
...and to have <u>done</u> it, means, can mean to accept, not only <u>danger</u>, but <u>betrayal</u>...?
..and <u>humiliation</u>?  What is this new job they've...?
Then, that being so, why is today special?  Why have you come back to see me?  Is it that new file they gave you?
Then what brings you back?
Yes.  I think I <u>do</u>.  I think it is a phrase you used with that woman.  You told her you were an <u>orphan</u>.  You <u>used</u>, to your mind, your most private fears.
...you called up memories of your <u>father</u> to...
...<u>barter</u> with her.  To appeal to her, and you feel that...
It is <u>you</u> who have betrayed...
Your father.  It is not <u>they</u>, who...
Yes, then, you're saying that you <u>haven't</u> bid upon these drawings.
Summer would have been a lot less without you. You're a true friend, Donald.
No.
Talia, don't go!
Are we allowed to start hating "Wendy" yet..."Gee Wichita, I guess mosquitoes have always liked me."
That would be a No.
...sorry...
Yes!  God yes!  I would tell her that I love her!  To not let anyone take away her dreams..!
Nobody really changes at summer camp. They merely find out who they are and become it more than ever.  You can't be helped, Wichita. I'm not sure you can be punished, either. But let's find out...
Todd was out there blocking the                             ] entrance. You would have been proud                         ] of me...My suit of armor is starting to come off. Not all of it, but enough to walk around...
I was thinking...if we could mesh my way of thinking with your way                            ] of thinking, we could really do some                        ] great counseling. It's all about                            ] the evolution of the species, we                            ] can improve...                                              ]
I know what you mean. But it doesn't put me in too great a position...
I'm still on anti-biotics, I really                         ] shouldn't be caffeining...Gosh, I've had a lot of daydreams about losing my virginity. Never one like this. For one, I wasn't a mutant. Secondly, I...What are you thinking?
Hey, you're not settling for the two shots are you? Knock me out girl. It's the only way.
So what was the first week of Spring Vacation withdrawl like?
I was talking with someone!
You were nothing before you met me! You were playing Barbies with Betty Finn! You were a Brownie, you were a Bluebird, you were a Girl Scout Cookie! I got you into a Remington Party! What's my thanks? It's on the hallway carpet. I get paid in puke!
TEENAGE SUICIDE; DON'T DO IT!
Heather, why can't you just be a friend? Why are you such a MegaBitch?
Shit.
That was my first game of Strip Croquet, you know. I thank you.
What are we going to tell the cops? "Fuck it if she can't take a joke, Sarge."
I'm just a little freaked, all right?  You got what you wanted, you know.
These are Ich Luge bullets. My grandfather snared a shitload of them in W.W. Two. They're like tranquilizers only they break the surface of the skin, enough to cause blood, but not any real harm.
Football season's over, Veronica. Kurt and Ram had nothing to offer the school but date-rapes and A.I.D.S. jokes.
It's over, J.D.  Over!
You really fucked me up, Veronica.
You two....
The world wants winners, I guess. Not people stained with loserness.
It's all yours, Heather. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go throw up.
waves a pair of new socks around. The family laughing and talking. Pauline is not participating. She is leaning back, looking morose. HONORA looks at her with concern.
If you think for one minute that your father and I will tolerate this sort of behaviour, you've got another thing coming! You're only 14!!! You're a child! What on earth's the matter with you, Yvonne? You know what can happen with boys . . . Don't you have any self-respect?
Can I go now?
I wouldn't want my private business being discussed with a complete stranger!
I think I'm dying . . .
I shall call him Diello.
But that's not true! I've got one.
Well? What do you say Trevor? Que pasa?
That `poor me' attitude doesn't suit you Trevor. Listen, I don't mean to sound like Pollyanna but things could be worse. There's one good thing about coming so near to the end of ones life. Everything is new and exciting, like your seeing it for the first time. You might see things a litlle differently from now on.
We startred off to be. She was, I guess I was. I just sort of....butchered up the relationship somehow.  Bad choice of words.
Yeah. It's like I was a different guy then I am today. I can't remember that guy. I see these women, they think I'm someone else, and I'm not that guy anymore. I'm not sure who Kristy knew.
GWEN?
You were supposed to have a date with Gwen last night? GWEN DEARDON? The supervisor?
You could say that.
As in one minus one equals zero yes. Where are you going with this?
What isn't wrong? Why are you doing this anyway?
Trevor I've decided we have got to agree on a name before we reach my mother's. This poor kid's going to be starting preschool as student x if we don't make up our minds. So, I've been thinking, what about Daisy?
Please Larry. Pretend you like me and humor me.
Hello? City? Cops? It's a fucking conspiracy!
I don't know what I'm doing here. I'm not even Catholic. I just had to tell somebody. It's like, ever since my wife died I don't know what I've actually done or what I've imagined. But I do know if one tenth of what's happening to me is reality... I've done some really awful things in my life. Things that I've... I guess I've blocked out...
Last week...
And you pulled people out? You're...  a hero.
A lotta people wouldn't have tried. It was pretty brave even trying...
You got those people out of the plane, LaPlante, not me.
Well, I donated a lot to different causes, uh... La...
I seen on the TV where that do-gooder asshole's gonna go visit sick kids at three-thirty.  Children's Hospital, on the double.
He waited for you three hours!
I am so tired of your bullshit, Bernie.
It's never your fault, Bernie! Never ever!  You screwed up my life, now you're gonna screw up Joey's life, but you're never gonna accept responsibility for anyth--
He had an emergency call... a <u>real</u> emergency.
Are you gonna take me somewhere next weekend?
Uh, if you could, just, uh, support, uh, a small airfield...
Did you get it?  Jesus, did I say that?
We're piecing together different accounts and...
She wants to quit?
I haven't won it yet.  I notice you've got me scheduled on a flight back an hour after the ceremony.
So, <u>Neil</u>.  How's it goin'?
Things are beginning to come to a head.  I can feel it.  And I want everything to be perfect.
I've cultivated her interests so that now we have even more in common than ever.
Oh no -- I mean, she's genuinely made me more fulfilled in many ways -- and I hope eventually to be able to teach her a few things, too.  What I mean is, I guess I'm still waiting for just that right -- synthesis between us -- where everything will be understood between us without even the need for words.
Yeah, maybe you're right. Everything else is just an excuse. I'm treating the situation with kid gloves because I'm afraid of losing her.
I should.
Right.
About what?
You've done a really great job with the house.  It's great!
So you don't have anything concrete?
Have you just plain asked him?
And?
I'm sure that's all it is, honey. Maybe you both just need a vacation.
Honey, do you want some hot chocolate?
Do you want me to come up and tuck you in?
I hear things in this house,
How long does it have to be a new house?
Neil's still having a bad time at school.  I feel terrible seeing him so upset all the time.
The floor has a nice shine to it.  Oh God -- we have twenty-two messages on the machine.
I was having a bad day -- I lost that job, I was dependent on other people, I was let down --
I think it's time I came home now.
Dad, we can't decide unless Rudolf gets to look too!
Do you see a man?
Lieutenant?
My name is Jennifer Hillman.  I'm an archaeologist.  I read in the paper about the murder yesterday and I thought I should come talk to you.
For Chrissake!  Gimme a break.  The guy disappears for seven years and as soon as he comes back it starts again.
Most people would show some sign of fear with a gun in their face.
Do you not hear the wind in the trees?  The songs of the birds.  The horses breath?  There is a whole world around you. Alive.  Living.  Feel it -- become part of it.  Live your life, Highlander.  It's going to be a long one.
Well?
Aye?
Different places.
Sometimes.
You're hurt.
What's going on?  Why did he call you Macleod?
Then who's Russell Nash?
I'm just trying to place you.
He's in there!
It flatters me you remember, old one. It's been what... two hundred years?
Would you care for some water, Conner?
Mike!  Mike, can you hear me?
You should warn them, Sonny.
Mars, watch the cops!  Kevin!  Watch the back of the house!
Bullshit!
<u>Shut up!  Shut up and get on the floor</u>!
Everyone knows what we look like, Dennis. We won't be able to hide.
We're cool.
Fuck you.  I'm running this shit.  You talk to me.
You've been in there a long time. What're you waiting for?
I'd be trying to get the best deal that I could.
The cops are comin'!
L.A. County Sheriffs are inbound from a bank robbery in Pico Rivera.
I'll kill you!  You won't get the other disk!
You leave that gun alone!
You gotta pee?
I'm Jeff Talley, the Bristo chief of police.  So far as we know, your children are okay.
Chief, base.
I couldn't find Jane.  She wasn't at the restaurant.
She didn't answer.
I want to know what in hell you're doing.
I'm not stupid!  You can't get out of here fast enough, then you take back command; you agree to wait on Smith, then you risk everything in a stupid stunt to get him out --
The kids are in here!
Yeah!  Here's a name.  This is somebody's personal tax --
When this phone rings, you answer.  It will be me.  I'll tell you what to do. When I have what I want, you get your family.
I have people in York Estates right under your nose.  If you do <u>anything</u> except what I'm telling you, you'll get Jane and Amanda back in the mail.  We clear on that?
Paul...  ...I have to talk to you.
Ten.
They fired a rocket at us.
I ran out of bribes. Bizimungu took them away.
Will you protect us.
Please, General, I will give you money, whiskey.
You lie.
I committed no war crimes.
I led no massacres.
You will tell them the truth.
You fucking see that!
Where are we going, sir?
The fog is too heavy, sir.
Who did you call?
Don't lie to me. What's your name?
This time the Militia will kill us.
The president has been murdered.
Has Roger spoken yet?
How can we help him.
Please, Paul, why do we have to go to the roof?
We have to have a plan.
Our children cannot see us die first. If the Militia comes, you must hurry up to the roof. I will meet you there.
Where are the receptionists? Where's Gregoire?
All. What do you mean all?
The staff and guests! How many?
It's not, baby. Just a matter of minutes now, before somebody pulls the trigger --
How much more do they need than your death at his hands?
And how the hell are we going to do that?
More the merrier.
Where is it??
Shouldn't somebody like, stand guard or something -- just in case?
Hey! Where'd you guys go?
Right here, Mr. Pritchett. As well as five other bona fide, bank drafts for one million dollars each. Made out to cash.
Three steps forward -- I want to get up there.
I think we should have taken a right back there.
What --
Melissa Margaret Marr, Celebrity.
What are you talking about?
You think this is fucking funny??
-- well, here's a better one: you're fired.
-- it's getting older by the second. Mr. Price, if I could just please have --
This is all maybe getting a little too strange --
Then tell me, please -- help me...!
Please! I need your help.
Uh, excuse me? Don't think I'm not having the time of my life watching this train wreck that's your marriage -- but this isn't what I had in mind... I want to know that we can get out of here if we need to.
Pritchett, this "lockdown" thing -- it's gotta have like a master control -- you know machinery, gears, whatever -- somewhere in this place?
No, you don't want to go down there. I am going down there. And I'm going to find <u><b>reverse</b></u> on this thing and floor it.
I feel something.  It's faint, but...it's there...
Did you find her?!
Can I do it again tonight?
H-how long will it take?
We're here Aubrey!  Look, don't be afraid.  We want you to come back to us...
Well maybe we don't need to remind her of it.  She has a lot more to adjust to...new friends, new schools...it would be good if she had a stable family environment.
What is it?
Aubrey!
You're bleeding.
You must be a Londrigan.
She's coming back.  Keep talking!
I said nothing before, for fear you wouldn't believe me.  I've been here before to cast evil from this house.  The amulet is a guard against evil, blessed in countless rituals.   It is an ancient ceremony of the early Catholic church, a ceremony whose secrets are all but lost.
We must return it, if you want your daughter back.
Where did you find this?
I see some faint lettering.  It appears to be the...Runic alphabet?
Wait ... wait.  You ... you have to help me.  I don't understand.  Am I dreaming this?
It's ... I don't know.  First World War, right?
Look, lady!  I told you!  It's not my problem!  I was just there!
Sorry.  It was my father's.  It's temperamental.
I was downtown looking for a ... a friend.  A guy I know.  Anyway, there was this store.  Like real old?  Lotsa weird shit in there.  I saw this statue. Pillar.  Thing.  I knew he'd love it. You've seen the club.
Sure.  Why?
Yes really.
How do we start?
That was beautiful.
Alex, did you know this ape was going to be here...
You got about five minutes and change.
Rio, Alex?  After all they've done to...Hey, these tickets are for Moscow!
Alex, are you....
Lucky for us, the Da Vinci is located in a wing of the Kremlin that they used to throw the Miss Ukraine pageant and stuff.  It'll have the least number of guards....
My God, that was bold of you, you didn't have to do that...
No, I meant you didn't have to tackle me and rip my dress.  A polite push, perhaps?  A clear shout of "watch out, Anna" would have done nicely...
What have you been doing?
Hey, don't take your disguise so seriously.
You're hitting Rutherford's Auction House.  Easy as my brother's wife.  Directions are in the bag.  Just open the seventh floor safe and take out the thingie...
Alchemy!  Is the business term of the 90's, my man!  Minerva read about it in an airline magazine about four years ago.  I dumped some lira into research... Shazam, we come across a diary by one of Da Vinci's apprentices detailing La Machine de Oro, the gold machine for those at home, and the rest is about to become history.  Money isn't everything, gold is.  Fuck blue chip stocks!  Fuck T-bills! Fuck Junk Bonds!  I got the real deal!  Money will always be paper but gold will always be gold!
The auction house, asshole.  One night's work and you're free like no ex-con's ever been.  No checking in with a shrink, no community service teaching retards how to play air hockey. It's a great deal, I can't lie.
Cool, isn't it?  Weight, feel, mal1eability, they're all but identical.  On the periodic chart of elements, they're but one proton apart.  Great minds worked for centuries to turn worthless into priceless.
Don't I know you...
The Daddy-Oh!
I'm tellin' ya, this guy's just the patsy and I'm gonna find out what for. There's a real story, Smitty, some kind of plot, a setup, a cabal, a -- oh, and say, did I tell ya?!
A sawbuck!
You're from Muncie?!
Norville... there's something I have to tell you. You see, I'm not really a secretary.
...You do?
I believe in you, Norville -- At least I believe in your... intentions --
...Oh, it's you! Lookin' for a nitwit to buy your lunch?!
Just got hired today!
Ya know, entry level!
I got big ideas, though!
Say, buddy! Who's the most liquid businessman on the street?
-- Uh... Buzz, I'm sorry, I -- Buzz, you gotta forgive me! I shouldn't a fired you, I didn't know what I was doing! I was a little funny in the head, I --
I'm brushing up on my French with the most charming man, Pierre of Fifth Avenue. Do you know him?
My God! The Bumstead contracts!!
...Congratulations, kid, you've really outdone yourself. Reinvented the wheel. I'm going to recommend to the Board that we proceed immediately with this, uh... with the, uh... that the dingus be mass-produced with all deliberate speed. Of course, as president of the company the ultimate decision is yours.
Maybe he's wise.
I really intended going out to the Fort and meeting you long before this, Miss Connell.  I'm Mrs. Rand -- Wesley's mother.
She can never be cured?
Is this disease common in the tropics?
Perhaps you ought to get on to the mill.
No, Wes.
Good morning, Miss Connell.
I still can't believe it Paul -- that you wouldn't say a word in your own defense.
You can't believe that.  You don't know what viciousness it would take to drive a person mad.  You're not vicious or cruel, Paul.
I can understand that.  Everyone feels that way about someone.
An accident at the mill?
What about her?
Investigation of what?
In other words, I'm on trial.
Benjie!
Well, it's the funniest thing. I've been talking to some investors -- a little outside venture, you understand, between you and me -- about a scheme to manufacture a new Styrofoam packaging. Little peanut like pieces that can really keep an item free from trauma during shipping. Miraculous. Anyway, it turns out the genius behind the whole project is your neighbor, Jim Williams. How about that!
Darned right. Look here, Benj, whaddya make of this sequel to The Godfather? You think it's gonna work?
You all right there?
You've...
About?
A prior engagement overcame me.
Listen, Benjamin Hood. I have obligations that precede your... from before you showed up. One or two, you know, good-natured encounters, that doesn't mean I'm... I'm not just some toy for you. When I remembered some chores I wanted to get done before the party, I just did them, that's all, because I wanted to do them before I saw Jimmy.
How you take it isn't all that interesting to me, Benjamin. I'm sorry --
He's probably been waiting all night at the station.
And to think -- they met at a key party of all things.
Hi mom.
I'm thinking of going back to school.
How'd you know?
I'm that predictable? No, you don't have to answer that. It's just that with the kids almost grown --
Waste not Master Hood -- that was $20 for the bag.
Paul, cancel your mental appointments, baby. What are you, like still stoned from last night?
Come on Paulie, share the wealth. You copped 'em from her mom's stash anyway.
Stupid!  Is Wendy Hood your girlfriend?
No one.
Wow!
Sandy, you scared the shit out of me.
Just thought I'd stop by.
Yeah.
Just after Leland Street.
Don't give misdemeanors a bad rap.
Duggar called him?
She left the party early.  Friends said she had a fight with her boyfriend and stormed out.
That's right.
So?
Weston Dobbs killed an eight year-old boy and left him hanging in the basement like a piece of meat.  You remember that?
One word to I.A. and he walks.
No way.
Will.
Hey...
You gave her gifts.
Expensive dresses.  A heart necklace.
Doesn't sound like a mentor to me.
Monstrous.
Your lips, they didn't move.
Claudia is dear to me. My... daughter.
No, my beloved, my child.
I'm not innocent. But I'm afraid. She feels she's in danger from the others.
But why?
Then blame the one who made her...
We want no quarrel with him.
More.
Oh, Claudia, you've outdone yourself. Where did you find them?
You see the old woman? That will never happen to you. You'll never grow old. You will never die.
Hush, Claudia, hush now my dear -
You know her?
You would leave me for Armand if he beckoned you.
He wants you as you want him. He's been waiting for you. He wants you for a companion. He bides his time that place. he finds them as dull and lifeless as we do.
Do you know what his soul said to me without saying a word? When he put me in that trance...
Diane!!!!
Take him.
The trick is not to think about it. See that one? The widow St. Clair? she had that gorgeous young fop murder her husband. She's perfect for you. Go ahead.
Read her thoughts.
Why do you do this Lestat?
You are the devil! You are the instrument of Satan!
I tried to tell you Louis... that night in Paris... when I first came to you... no-one can refuse the dark gift, Louis... not even you.
And the more you tried, the more I wanted you... a vampire with your beautiful, suffering human heart. And how you suffered... I need your forgiveness, Louis.
But why did you tell her?
And did you lose her? Did she go?
And the child who did die?
I want off this island.
I thought you were out of town!
Oh!
It's okay...He doesn't believe me. That's his right. I'm starting to think I'm crazy, too.
Be careful, Julie.
I understand something.
I am not crazy, Tyrell. He was right there.
Just take deep breaths and think of something happy from childhood.
Deep breaths --
You've got a better chance of getting hit by lightning.
Why are you doing this to me?
I trusted you.
Pretty cool bar.
To a great weekend --
Hell, that's worth three, easy. And you got your waiting period.
Where is everybody?
But the gods played a little trick on me. I was born in Switzerland.
She's right. This is hardly the time to bandy old tales.
I'm not sure that it is the plague.
Where's Thea?
I have been troubled about you. I want you to know that my room is just downstairs --  You have only to cry out if you are ill  or frightened.
I felt he did not like me.
I'm a woman -- a lonely woman. I have few friends.
I have not had a happy life --but that one thing - - that terror which brings me awake out of deep sleep - I want to avoid it.
I don't want to be buried alive. If I die I want to be sure - quite sure.
No, I want more than that. I beg you General, make sure --drive a knife through my heart -- anything.
That's superstition. That's something out of old tales -- about the dead who live - I'm talking of something else --cataleptic attacks -- apparent death that is not real.
There is something evil about her.
I know all you are going to say -I have been saying it to myself, but the thought will not leave my mind. She resembles my wife -there is something about her the way she moves  the way she turns her head.
Daughter -- my daughter --
Times are bad, Mr. Potter. A lot of these people are out of work.
What the Sam Hill you yelling for, George?
Well, that's the doggonedest thing . . . I haven't heard anything out of that ear since I was a kid. Must have been that jump in the cold water.
Yeah, yeah, I know. You told me that. What else are you? What . . . are you a hypnotist?
Well then, why am I seeing all these strange things?
Then if I wasn't born, who am I?
Why, yes. This is amazing.
Thank you very much.
Well?
Hee-haw!
Oh, no, Please, don't go out this way, Mr. Bailey.
Mr. Gower, I won't ever tell anyone. I know what you're feeling. I won't ever tell a soul. Hope to die, I won't.
I know it's soon to talk about it.
Two cents worth of shoelaces?
Avast, there, Captain Cook! Where you headin'?
Some other time, George.
Those Rockefellers!
Yes, sir.
I'm not very good at this.
They're way downtown. They'd be on my side, too.
After that, who cares?
Oh, George, George, George.
Oh, George, George!
Great!  Find one for me.
Don't!
Putz -- that won't be for hours.
But the island!
How're we going to do that floating on this garbage...?
We got a helluva tide this month.
You're too close.  Back off.
Is Hooper coming to dinner?
May I have this dance?
The shark that did this.  It was a shark, wasn't it?
But that's what we're here to find out, right?
Mmmm.
Oh, hi -- How was dinner?
What is it?  What's the matter?
Harbor Air, do you read?  Over?
The lighthouse is a make-out spot.
Did you ever see a dolphin?
Take a break for a minute, okay?
Rich or poor, it's nice to have money.
That's fun!  Let's race for some- thing!
I don't need you.  Andy's here.
You should've been out there.  You should've seen him waving that gun, like a maniac.  There were shots fired!
I'll need more men to look.
We're going to have to cover the entire lagoon.
That macho pompous English --
My imagination isn't that good.
... If nothing's wrong, why are we stopping here?
You sound like Houston Mission Control.  What the hell does it mean?
Swim where?  Out there?  Oh, no, forget it, not me!  You go, I'm staying.
Yeah, and so will I be if I start swimming in that blackass jungle.
Wouldn't this whole thing be a little safer in the daytime?
Honey, what is it?
Michael, take deep breaths.
Come on.
Yes, you can.
Are you okay?
I insist you get rid of that bomb.
You're supposed to film it, not turn it to hash!
We can assume he's back in the water intake passage.
Sean.  Sean, where are you?
Besides that.
I know!  We can take the gondola ride!
Yes, it's great!
Come on, it's fun!
You're not in the water.  You're in a gondola.
Sean, this is ridiculous.  You're acting very immature.
Back, Kelly.  Lean back!
How far away is filter number four?
How is he?  Still fighting crime?
Big bust!  He confiscate their water pistols?
It has its virtues.  It hasn't fallen down yet....
What do I think?  I think it's a lovely idea....
What the hell are we arguing about?
I could use a half-dozen more arms ...I've only got two weeks to get this thing finished....
Usually it's all he talks about...You mustn't worry....
I used to worry...But you know what happens, you find out that scuba diving's safer than climbing into the bathtub....
Henny Youngman....
What the hell's it doing in warm water anyway...?
Ask the big doctor about his work.  Tough life you Bahamian beach bum... Playing in the water all day....
We have to dig it deep so the water will go all the way around...So we can swim to it....
I want you to get out of the water....
I want you to give up that terrible job.
You're damn right I'm serious....
Nothing out of the ordinary....
You hungry?
Depends on where you want to go....
Couple of more passes and I'll buy my own airplane.. Hell, maybe my own airline....
All or nothing.  You want to roll them for me?
I can't....
You're going after her in that? You're crazy...It'll take all day in that bathtub....
I want you to leave her alone.  I don't want you involving her in....
The stuffing came out of the pillow he was wearing....
Office of Naval Research has some money....
Money is money....
We're out of money, partner.. We wrap it up, write it up and turn it in... How come your heart sounds stronger than mine?  You got two of them...?
Okay.. .we're done, man....
When I got the grant.....
When I invited you...
Okay...we got it together....
We've got a rare bird here, Michael. Great whites don't come to the Bahamas.  There's never been one down here before.  I'm not just going to let it swim away.
We lost it....
If you hadn't been gassing about Hoagie....
If it works, if we can get it inside the bastard and set it off, it'll shock the hell out of it.  We'll need a slave switch to set it off. Pull the dry cell out of the radio.
Woman has taste....
No, Sir. I haven't started till Monday. I'm a "tourist."
How's the new residence?
What does that mean?
Pig Woman agreed to take a test.
Did he shut you down?
I dunno, I daren't go in there - just about get her wired up, and the fucking mayor walks in - mad as hell - what are we doing fuck- ing with his staff? We should be out chasing major violators ..
Ease off, John ..
Everything you say sounds reason- able. But there's also a reason- able explanation for the opposite.
Policemen's bodies age at diff- erent rates. Look at me. Gut in its fifties. Balls in their six- ties. And feet in their eighties ..
You're pushing this too hard. It's like you <u>want</u> me to say <u>stop</u>? You must know that's the way this is going, John? There's other work to do, why don't ya ease off a little?
Then <u>where's the body</u>? .. Where's the body, and <u>why's he hidden it</u>?
Have you got a match on the bullet?
Have you got a print from the hand?
It could be anyone's hand. Illeg- ally disposed of hospital debris ..
She's <u>not</u> "missing." Did she shout? Did she scream? Did he coerce her? <u>No</u>. She left of her own free will .. And if she gets on a plane and goes to Peru with the prick, she's still not missing. You got no case, John.
I <u>have</u> heard you. You just don't like hearing <u>me</u>. You got this whole damned thing outta proportion. I don't know what you gotten used to in Los Angeles, but I don't believe there's a Police Chief, <u>in this country</u>, would put a task force together for a body part ..
Did you find the knife, Sergeant?
Kid told me he didn't take it?
Yes, Sir.
Well, apparently, she saw Amber the weekend she left, & was briefly in the room with the guy she left with.
I suppose I'm the worst witness you've ever had?
I have to talk to you, Helena.
You know? How do you know?
What are you doing, Travis?
Why?
Is that Margie?
Hey, we're not talking "talk" tonight.
The coroner wants to know if we can release the derelict?
This can't be happening to me.
Oh Jerry.
Airight.  Enough.  I'm pulling him out of this.  This isn't what I had in mind anyway.
But I mean really... wonderfully...  great.
Thanks for inviting me over. Where's the little guy?
Well.
Don't worry about it, boss.
Yeah, I did.
No.  No don't feel like Clarence Thomas.
Well -- this would be goodnight.
It's my fault.
It's not fair to you.  This whole --
I took advantage of you and worst of all, I'm not alone. I did this with a kid.  I was just on some ride where I thought I was in 1ove enough for both of us.  I did this.  And at least I can do something about it now.
I don't need you to "stick."
I don't know --
I heard.
This guy would go home with a gardening tool right now if it showed interest.  Wait.  Use the frosted glasses.
Matt, I came here because in all honesty your son is just another piece of cattle to SMI.  But to me --
--  now to recap, I want to stay in Arizona, I want my new contract, I like you, you're nice to my wife, I will stay with you, that's what I'm doing for you, but here's what you're gonna do for me. You listening?
It's a very personal, very important thing.  It's a family motto.  So I want to share it with you.  You ready?
See this jacket I'm wearing?  You like it?  I don't really need it, because I'm CLOAKED IN FAILURE. I lost the number one draft pick the night before the draft. They will teach my story to other agents on "do not do this" day in agent school. Why? Let's recap. Because a hockey player's kid made me feel like a superficial jerk, I had two slices of bad pizza, went to bed, grew a conscience and wrote a 25-page Manifesto of Doom!
The least you could do is nod and act sympathetic --
What's wrong.
Tidwell moves to a tan in a wheelchair, signs an autograph and moves on.  Jerry alongside. The quarterback sucks, man.  He's gonna get me killed.
You're with the sports people on the plane, right?
Bobbi Fallon.  BPI.  I'm producing the Coke commercials for the playoffs.
I'll go back to them.
You...
I don't see any.
Eric!
Her new boyfriend.
It's not safe.
We should try fishing again.
We have to keep looking for Dad. We have to.
Absolutely not.
You have to believe me. I did it with the best intentions.
Eric, your parents are both here.
Do you have any kids?
That's a very nice offer, Mr. Kirby, but I'm afraid I'm much to busy. If you like I can refer you to a number of highly qualified...
Whatever you do, don't call the U.S. Embassy. They won't do a God Damn thing.
Why didn't you tell us about these guys, Ian?!
Are you looking for a problem?
"InGen."  What's InGen?
What?
If I don't move, I can't shoot it.
Then this is our chance.
No.  I'm quite certain you can't.
Can you set up?
The kid scores with cheap sentiment.
We have to send someone to look for him!
Phones are out too.
What?  No menthol?
That's up to your guy on the boat.  Seven o'clock tomorrow night, at the east dock. Make sure he got it right.
Did I say jerk?
But you know, I should  really be the one going .
Well, because you're a - - I'm a - -
Ellie, we can tear up the rule book on cold-bloodedness. It doesn't apply, they're totally wrong!  This is a warm-blooded creature.  They're totally wrong.
- - like birds - -
- - a gizzard - -
- - what happens is that after a while, the stones get smooth, every six weeks, so the animal regurgitates them - -
- - and swallows fresh ones.
What about the lysine contingency?  We could put that into effect!
That's right.  Will break through.
I know, it's very exciting.
And scary.
It's anti-nature.
Hola, Juanito
And we can charge anything we want!  Two thousand a day, ten thousand a day - - people will pay it!  And then there's the merchandising - -
Okay, that's not so bad, ah Tim?
It's just like coming out of a tree house.  Did your dad ever build you a tree house, Tim, eh?
Me too.  Okay.  Well, the main thing about climbing is never, never look down, never.
So am I going to help you with your foot?
Go, go, go, jump!
Where does he think he's going?
Robert.  Robert Muldoon, my game warden from Kenya.  Bit of an alarmist, I'm afraid, But he's dealt with the raptors more than anyone.
Hear that?  Are you hearing this?
Do as he says!  The power's coming back, Timmy!
I think perhaps I'll just sit down.  I don't suppose you think all that much of me now, do you?
I don't know, I don't know.  I'm sorry - -
Fifty.
There doesn't seem to be any water damage. Kind of cozy, actually.
What's going on?
Now... I think the video store's open for another couple of hours. Let's go.
That's the problem with this case. Everyone thinks they know Jason's life story. But they don't. What you're remembering is a _movie_. Fiction. In the movie, Jason's mother runs around, killing people after Jason drowns in Crystal Lake
Well, Jason _was_ in a canoe accident in 1967 and presumed drowned. His mother died a few years later after a long bout with cancer. Some time in the early eighties, there were a string of murders out by Crystal Lake...  People started saying it was Jason... back from the dead.
I thought you said Krueger burned to death.
Uh-huh...
Where's he going?
Great. Now there's _two_ serial killers on the loose.
It's only majestic from here. When you get closer you see it for what it really is.
A glorified office block.  They keep all the old records there -- the final resting place for facts and figures that have ceased to matter in the world of the living.
Gabriela was right -- it's easier for me to understand suicide. I'm a practicing suicide.
In an organization as efficient as ours, if a document once in a great while gets lost it might never be found at all.
But <u>I'm</u> the messenger.  An error like this damages my credibility.
When I deliver a message the very act of delivering it, you might say, gives it an official stamp, and only in this way are both the sender and the receiver satisfied that it was delivered at all.
I'm sorry, but I just wondered --
Ah -- we're back to the "authorities" you spoke of.
Or what if there really <u>was</u> an error? -- I don't know what kind -- any kind that needed correcting -- and what if Burgel was responsible for it?  One mistake -- even a small one in a firm like ours -- it could cost him a promotion.
What seems important to these people is not determined by the amount of work it entails -- you're far from understanding the authorities if you believe that.
Maybe it's true then what she said.
-- You said so yourself the firm is large and powerful.  If the discrepancy really was something big, Eduard's responsibility would still have to be small.  No poor young <u>clerk</u> could find himself in such a fix.
-- And the new patients they bring me aren't usually as dexterous as you've been in evading us.  Not perfect specimens by any means, but not the type of person who'll be missed either.
They keep switching us from department to department.  He doesn't mind because he can't sit still.
Can I see the map? My father spoke of references to a Beast God ...
Oh God, it's that bloody yank!
It's the same image - Kong!
They're stoking the boilers. As soon as we've got some steam, we're outta here.
Hey! I thought these things were supposed to be extinct!
Are you gonna start it up?
Why?
What's that?
-- I have to close up now. Leave your name and number with his message service, Mrs. Daniel, and why don't you just go home and wait until he --
Well I have to close up now.
Yes indeed.
Who?
Gee.
Why?
Honest?
Klute, tell me, what's your bag? Are you a talker, or a button man or a doubler, or maybe you like them very young -- children -- or get your chest walked around with high-heeled shoes, or have us watch you tinkle? Or --
Oh golly, oh just what I've always dreamed of, dirty phone calls.  How come?
Is there anything more I could --
What're you gonna do next?
What do I do meanwhile? -- wait for that clown to fall through the skylight on me?
You said it was!
Oh -- wait -- oh I get it. You said that just to keep me scared. So I'd tell you everything I -- oh clever; oh you smart, tricky hick.
Hey, but did we get to you, Klute? A little?
-- Us city folks? The sin, the glitter, the wickedness?
Please.
No.  Well all right. But you want to and I want you to and we both know it and all right.
Where'd you spend last night?
I called Trina.
Bree, what's actually happened? It wasn't that bad.
Why couldn't you stay here with me?
All right, suppose it wasn't Tom Grunemann; where does that get you?
Then, close the case.
Where, how?
You just finished telling me she had nothing to offer. Not Tom, you said, the Dumper was clearly not Tom.
I'm looking for a man. Tom Grunemann.  Bree thinks he may have been the dumper -- that call she had two years ago. She says you sent her on it.
They tell me you use narcotics. Could I bring someone around to look at your arms?
Think this is our guy?
Mr. Kramer, do you ever have sex in here with anyone?
Does that distress you?
What does?
I'll tell you what, kiddo--why don't I fix us some French toast?
Mom, I mean dad...
Daddy?
I'm sorry...
Objection.
Objection!
Objection!
Ummm, hmmm... umm, hmmm...  Well, this looks very good.. Of course  ... you understand this is the worst time of the year to look for a job.
Mr. Kramer, nobody even thinks about leaving their job until after they get their Christmas bonus.
My American Express...My Bloomingdale's Credit Card... My check book--
I took two thousand out of the savings account.  That was what I had in the bank when we got married.
Here are the slips for the laundry and the cleaning.  They'll be ready on Saturday.
Joanna, go be a mother.  Get married, have kids.  Don't get married, have kids.  Do whatever you want.  I don't give a damn. Just leave me out of it--and leave my baby out of it.
Listen, don't let it get you down.  You're going to be fine.
Look, Ted, I'm the oldest whore on the beat, okay?  Three marriages, two divorces...You're gonna be okay.
Okay, Phyllis, what's up?
Look, she walked out on her own child, right?  That's desertion, right? Mr. Shaunessy, I'm telling you it's an open and shut case.
What?!  She wants what?!
I've got enough trouble raising my own kid.  I don't need another one.  Got it?
You're on your own, understand?
You're sure?
Please go away, Thel...I...I just have to be by myself for a little while...
I am sorry, Lhamo.
Do you have plans to return soon, Dalai Lama?
Oh, no. Where will he go?
May I listen to the news with you, Holiness?
What is the size of our army, now?
The pursuit of non-violence. Very difficult.
I have news. The Regent has resigned his post.
Well, some say. It's not for you to worry about. Another will be chosen.
We have enemies.
Yes.
Taktra Rinpoche, I understand there was an attempt on your life.
You are unharmed?
And how would you have accomplished this, Ma'am?
I might get a shot.
Jesus Christ!!
What are <u>you</u> doing?!
I'm laying a spring trap!
I keep telling you, they <u>can</u> come on land, I don't wanna wake up in the middle of the night--
Maybe he doesn't play well with others.
Well, you can try talking them into that, if--
<u>Forget</u> <u>it</u>.
You take care.
She didn't tell us about the other croc 'cause she was afraid we'd blow it's head off.
<u>Did</u> you want to be killed by it?
Hector.  What you just did... there was at least some sort of a death wish going on.
Excuse me?
Did you make anything of the tooth?
He could be right there and you wouldn't see him.
You know they say the brain confuses fear for passion.
When you get scared, the brain releases a chemical, same chemical it releases when somebody's...  in high school, the thing to do was to take the girl to a scary movie.
I'm saying between the moonlight, a beautiful lake <u>and</u> a monster that bites heads off... you look good.
Forgive me for trying to be nice.
I didn't say it like that.
I was trying to pay you a compliment, I was guising it as science 'cause I know you're comfortable in that arena. Science.
Thing we can lift it?
I'm not mushing it.
Hector!!
That was... y'know if the guy asks me can she kiss, now I'll be able to tell him if you can.
I can't.  I'll get Hector!!
You're sort of a rude person.
Was that like a homo-sexual remark?
If he gets close, you go <u>up</u>, Hector, don't you endanger that cow.
Oh.  Oh.  That's okay.  Well.  This uh... this probably wasn't meant to be, y'know.  I mean, I'm... God, I gotta be ten years younger and you, <u>you</u>... you're y'know...
<u>Oh</u>...  No, no, I'm not angry I'm not, I'm just thrown, I'm...  I actually have an early lunch, so...
You missed Fourth Amendment law. Unlawful seizure, real juicy stuff. Where were you all afternoon?
Wear it, don't ever leave it in your purse. Dry fire it whenever you get the chance. And do your exercises.
Do you need a police escort, Starling? Or do you think you can find the airport by yourself?
Are they close to catching somebody, do you think?
Okay, Starling. Let's have it.
What should I say? You did fine work. We'll wait on the lab.
Are you finished?
All his victims are women... His obsession is women, he lives to hunt women. But not one women is hunting him - except me. I can walk in a woman's room and know three times as much about her as a man would.  I have to go to Belvedere.
Doctor, we have a hard problem in psychological profiling. I want to ask for your help with a questionnaire.
I am, yes.
"Plum Island Animal Disease Research Center." Sounds charming.
They were slaughtering the spring lambs?
So you ran away...
But you could. You did.
Look... search your own records, if you prefer. You can do it a lot faster than us, anyway. If we find Buffalo Bill through your information, I'll suppress it. Nobody has to know this hospital cooperated.
Oh, that's clever, Dr. Danielson. Very humorous. You like the truth? Try this.  He kidnaps young women and kills them and rips their skin off. We don't want him to do that anymore. If you don't help me, just as fast as you can, then the Justice Department is going to ask publicly for a court order, We'll ask twice a day, just in time for the morning and evening news. And each one of our press conferences will focus on Dr. Danielson, over at Johns Hopkins, and how we're still hoping for his cooperation. And every time there's any news on the case - when Catherine Martin floats, when the next one floats, and the next one - why, we'll just issue another press release about good ol' Dr. Danielson, over at Johns Hopkins - complete with all his humorous fucking remarks.
Are you alright?
Mr Poe?
Where will we go?
I see...
Who were these people?
So what is it, Jack? What brings you up here?
Folks here goin' to join in that fight?
Many men here, their homes are in the path.
Things were done. Nobody was spared...
Men are to stay in file, Sergeant Major!
That's where a lead bullet has torn you.
What's wrong?
I've been looking at the duty roster...at the shack hours outstanding...
Go on!
That's an order!
How's astronaut training?
No.  I'm just being friendly.
It hit me!  Where are they?!
Wait till you reach thirty- five before you blow your suit...
What're you saying?  That we're not even going to be picked up tomorrow?
But it's a delay!  How long? A day?  Two days?!
Cute, DeJesus...Specimen cups?
Oooooh.  Damn!  Not so loud. Turn down the music.
Bad as he is there's no way we can make our quota with- out his sad self out there. You just can't do it.
How far away is she?
No...he's really sick.  I heard him last night.  The company will take that into consideration...
Are you sure you saw something?
Is there something we should know about you, Soap?
Let me tell you about Hatchet Harry. Once there was this geezer called Smithy Robinson who worked for Harry. It was rumoured that he was on the take. Harry invited Smithy round for an explanation. Smithy didn't do a very good job. Within a minute Harry lost his temper and reached for the nearest thing at hand, which happened to be a fifteen-inch black rubber cock. He then proceeded to batter poor Smithy to death with this; that was seen as a pleasant way to go . . . Hence, Hatchet Harry is a man you pay if you owe.
What's that?
No, I asked you to give me a refreshing drink. I wasn't expecting a fucking rainforest; you could fall in love with an orang-utan in that.
I thought this was a pub.
Well whatever it is, could you get your man to turn the TV down?
Shotguns? What, like guns that fire shot?
Oh, thanks very much. And there had better be something there for us.
Son?
We gotta get those guns.
Listen, I don't care who lives in there; all as I know it's got to be preferable to death by Hatchet.
It must be this one.
Are you sure you can afford twenty-five?
I don't think we will take the risk for seven hundred quid.
Tom, this is our case.
That you, boy?
It's pay day, ain't it?
Sawn-offs are out, Tom; people like to have a bit mare range nowadays.
Of course you will look mean, Tom, you will look really scary.
This guy Rory Breaker can afford to do the deal at the price we are selling. It's not worth him giving us trouble; he knows we would be a pain in the arse, and who wants a pain in the arse?
You would take a pain n the arse full stop.
I'm only going to have you for two more years. If you decide not to go on to college--
--you're going to be on your own.
So I'm worried about you. I don't want you to end up in jail like your friends.
Don't try to con me, Amado. You knew how they got all those things.
That makes it okay?
Sergeant Major? How is Richie doing? Private Graves?
What's that for?
So?
Where'd he get all this?
Uncle Al--
I'm a colonel.
It's a small post and they're phasing it out in two years, but I moved up in rank and--well, a command is a command.
My mother said he never asked about--
Homework?
Tanks, huh?
Since I've been stationed here? A fistfight now and then--
Sheriff--hi--this is Sergeant--this is Priscilla Worth.
Your boys out there cooped up together, need somewhere they can let the steam out. If they're Black, there's not but one place in this town they feel welcome. Been that way since before you were born.
Well, you're the Man out there now, aren't you? It's your call.
I been hearing rumors about this new commander coming for a couple weeks now. Boys say they heard he's a real hard case. Spit-and-polish man. Full- bird colonel name of Payne, they say-- Bet you never figured you end up back here.
Right.
Over the years, this is the one place that's always been there. I loan a little money out, settle some arguments. Got a cot in the back- people get afraid to go home they can spend the night. There's not enough of us to run anything in this town- the white people are mostly out on the lake now and the Mexicans hire each other. There's the Holiness Church and there's Big O's place.
Es muy lindo, su coche--
Is very beautiful, your car.
Every other damn thing in the country is called after Martin Luther King, they can't let our side have one measly park?
Dammit, Sam, the people are concerned about crime--
Besides my father, I mean.
And Buddy was one of them.
People have worked this whole big thing up around my father. If it's built on a crime, they deserve to know. Now I understand why you might want to believe he couldn't do it.
There isn't money allocated for that. But a jail--
Buddy was more a part of the big picture--county political machine, chamber of commerce, zoning board if I kept those people happy, he was pretty much on my side.  Whenever somebody thought--they start up another bar for the black  folks, they'd be--how should I put this? They'd be officially discouraged.
You built our patio while you  were on the county?
I've heard Wade was a bit tough on the Mexicans--
Murdered him?
I should get back.
Hospital says the other kid is in bad shape--
Down from Houston. I think he knew the girl before.
Any poop on the John Doe you found out there today?
--but longhorns are hard to come by these days.
How am I gonna sell things if nobody comes by? This stretch of road runs between Nowheres and Nothin' Much.
Hello, L.A.
Thanks, Billy.
We've all of us waited too long to have the homecoming spoiled.
You didn't think it was just going to be you and me?  A lot of people believed in Nix. They haven't forgotten his promise.
Death.
Ever watched a man die?  If you watch very closely, you can sometimes see the soul escaping. And if you're very quick, you can catch it.
He's good.
It's okay.
... oh... God...
...yes?
I'm putting in a new illusion tonight.  Will you be there?
With what?
I can't let you in.
My God.
You've taken some strange journeys in your life.
You're drawn to the dark side, over and over.  And it's drawn to you.  You don't like that.
So Nix won't come looking for her?
And she shot him I  I think that'd piss me off if I were Nix.
He did something with the ground.
Can you do it?
You could still help me do that.
Because you've got nothing else to live for.
A Soul's Search: Finding Your True Calling - are you reading this?
Do you remember when we met at the bar? ...You were wearing a tuxedo.
Really?
It's bad isn't it?
You think so?
I don't want to go back tomorrow.
Why can't it last?
Hello?
Hi, Lydia.
Uh, no.
Ok, whatever you think... I'm lost.
That's not what I'm talking about.
I don't know.
I don't know... I want to be more healthy. I want to eat better.
You know, eat healthier.
Not all that pasta.
Like Japanese food.
Oh, come on.
I gotta go meet Kelly for a drink downstairs. She wants to talk about some photo thing.
You wanna come?
A Soul's Search: Finding Your True Character and calling? Is this yours?
You don't have to be embarrassed.
Uh..thanks.
Hey, what are you doing here in the middle of the day?
I spaced out.
Listen to me, I love you, Peter, I'm trying to protect you!
So you don't believe his condition is the result of anything supernatural?
Between your book sales and this TV thing, there's going to be no living with you.  And let me guess, you boiled God down to a conceit.
Father, please don't die.
You're sure?  There was nothing?
Peter, I believe your baptism was perverted.  Look at your certificate. Your mother was the only witness to it. Your blood-type doesn't match who you thought your father was.  Peter...I'm sorry.
He couldn't stop us and that's how he was punished.  Peter, what time were you born?
Book five, Deuteronomy, chapter seven, verse five.  "But this shall you deal with them.  You shall break down their altars and burn their graven images with fire."
You know what?  You can go.
What's this?
Ah, Mom.
Hi.
Okay.
I can take it.
That was nice.
You need to.  She's alone in this house all day, taking care of Dad and your ungrateful behind.
That's what you get for trying to show out, freshman.
You were trying to make me look bad.
So...does it hurt?
For real?
See, that's why you ain't getting recruited.
When'd you get this?
Yo, where's the "D"?
Hey.
You weren't at my game.
Shouldn't you be lying down, or...
I'm fine.  My dad said you tore your ACL.
What are the doctors saying?
I thought a torn ACL was ten to twelve.
You asked me what was missing.
From basketball.
We should head over.
With who?
You just got back from a four game road trip.
How was your game?
Still the man.
Sorry.
It's been the same fuckin' thing for thirty years, Burt --
Wanna call me a slut now, something?
Wilson.
What?
Yeah, but I don't know --
No.
I didn't realize it was that loud.
Yeah.
This is my job.
Well if you listen' to that music too loud again and that fella returns maybe we'll share another cup of coffee --
No. No.  Don't joke about that. That's not funny, Claudia.  Please, now.
Ok, then.  Keep your chin up and your music down, alright?
Just Jim.
Bye, bye, Claudia.
You live alone?
What's your name?
Richard, shut it and keep it down.
Doc it's Janet.
I have to talk to Frank, is he nearby?
I need you to interupt him, I need to get him on the phone with me right away --
Things go round 'n round, don't they?
This sounds Sad as a Weeping Willow.
I don't know.
Do you know Lily?  Phil..do you know her?
...Lily...?
She's my love...my life...love of it... In school when you're 12 years old. In school, in six grade....and I saw her and I didn't go to that school...but we met. And my friend knew her...I would say, "What's that girl?"  "How's that Lily?" "Oh, she's a bad girl...she sleeps with guys..."  My friend would say this....but then sometime...I went to another school, you see? But then...when high school at the end, what's that?  What is that?  When you get to the end?
No, no, the grade...the grade that you're in?
You're hurting a lot of people, Frank --
I'm here.  I'm here now.  What do you want? Do you want anything?
You look great.
...you know...
No.
It's just...too late for me to be fuckin' around.  I gotta stop. I gotta clean my brain of all the shit I've done that I shouldn't have done --
I don't mean to cry, I'm sorry.
She thinks terrible things that somehow got in her head...that I might have done something.  She said that to me last time...when it was...ten years ago she walked out the door, "You touched me wrong..." "I know that." Some crazy thought in her, in her head...
We're not going out two days before we set the record, it's not gonna happen.
listen...listen to me now, Phil: I'm sorry, sorry I slapped your face. ...because I don't know what I'm doing... ...I don't know how to do this, y'know? You understand?  y'know?  I...I'm...I do things and I fuck up and I fucked up....forgive me, ok? Can you just...
I don't wanna go, I can't do it this time.
...oh Jesus, what the fuck...?
What -- ?
What had you to do with this, Mother?
Porthos sleeps, and you plot.  Don't you think it's time you told me what it is you are plotting?
Hang himself?!
We must stop him!
No!  Stop --
Where are we?
Aramis... These are... these are whores!
What choice is there?  If Phillippe is in the Bastille, then to the Bastille we will go.
This cannot be.  Everyone knows the Queen Mother is a recluse, and the ladies-in-waiting are but mistresses for the king!
You look so sad.  Is it something I have done?
What is that?
The old man and woman called me... Phillippe.
I was told this impostor was dead!
You've... memorized...?
Ah yes, the riots.  We have food stocks on the wharves right now, no?
Exactly why it should be given away.
Captain Doyle?
You can cut the shit, asshole--
If you can trail him to a remote area do it. We all want a piece of him but let's keep our heads and stay within the law - we got people everywhere out here.
Anyhow... you wake up and she's gone. But--  --this is my favorite part--  she leaves you the keys to a brand new Beemer.
Vice...you think they had something to do with this dead hooker?
You always carry a gun with you?
Operator, I'd like to make a collect call - 213-467-0972...
OK...county tax records...they're saying 1490 Breckinridge is owned by... an Atlantic Trust Corporation...they have a P.O. box in D.C.
Where did you learn to fight like that? JIM  I read a book.
Are you a regular there?
Ditched you?
Sidney: I don't understand him.  We know he re-arranges the kids and husbands into a dead audience.  To witness the act. We know he thinks the act is making him into something different. His 'becoming'... but I don't know what it is he thinks he's becoming.  The answer is something to do with how he uses the mirrors. That's what's missing for me.  Why the mirrors?
And do what? Read about the next family in the morning paper?  In my Monkey Ward safehouse 'cause I can't take my family home?  This ends when I make it over.
This is Chester here. Who am I talking to?
We got an ad order in tonight's "Tattler" with 'six-six-six' in it. It's being Telexed to you right now.
'Dear Pilgrim, you honor me.'
...snuck in the hospital while I was sedated, flipped back the sheets and shot pictures. The only decent thing he did was run a black square over my balls...
Who is it?
What'd it say?
Tell me now.
Get me a plane...
Get me a plane!
What it's going to say on the Jacobi film can is the same as it says on the Leeds' film can: Gateway Lab, St. Louis, Missouri.
Where the hell's Graham!
You worked out well.
Two groups of people were changed. Leeds and Jacobi. The police think they were murdered.  Do you know what they call the being that visited these people?  You can say.
Do you see?
I want to see Lecktor now.
Our people swear he wore surgeons' gloves the whole time. They dusted everything.
Why do you think he took his gloves off?
'Intimate? !"
...sorry, Molly. I'm sorry this happened to you.
It's Will Graham. Is Molly there, Mr. Swenson?
Sure he is. Blond.  Probably Scandinavian, too...
Yes. Is Molly there?
I know... 'Out in the good air...'
That's the same atrocious aftershave you wore in court three years ago.
Glaser Safety Slugs?
Kevlar Second Chance.
Because he's gone for the head shot seven out of eight times'
Okay.  Fine, I'll do it.  But I have a few terms.
I'm here with Ed over at Taxi. There's been some trouble with Tony.
The world thinks Andy Kaufman sucks. So I was just giving 'em what they want...
So, Mr. Besserman, same slot tomorrow...?
You're firing me??  You don't even pay me!
Right...
Why did you call me?  The last person I ever expected to get a call from was you.
Is this an act -- or are you addicted to causing trouble??
Hey Andy, good show.
This is great.  The crowd's gonna love this!  Hey... do you still think any of those cowgirls are still alive?
Well, call SAG.  It'd be cool to get one on the show.  I want the evening to build and build.  It's gonna have the most incredible ending: Singers, dancers, the "Hallelujah Chorus" -- then the sky opens, and Santa Claus comes flying down!
Gene, you misunderstood!!  You're not getting BOTH of them!  It's physically impossible!
Yeah, I KNOW what I said!  But -- trust me, it's not gonna happen!
Why...?  Andy, why...?
Sure...
Bob.
Bob Gorsky.
I sent two units.  They're bringing her down now.
You weren't supposed to relieve me.
Goddamn you, Cypher!
There was an accident.  A fucking car accident.  All of a sudden. Boom.  Jesus, someone's going to make a believer out of me.
Just get me outta here.
Morpheus...
Who's coming for me?
Right now?
I imagine, right now, you must be feeling a bit like Alice, tumbling down the rabbit hole?
Right now, we're inside a computer program?
If you are killed in the Matrix, you die here?
No.  No!  Morpheus!  Don't!
That vase.
It's the question that brought you here.  You know the question just as I did.  It is a hacker's question.
Did you go to her?
What did she tell you?
No, you... have to be.
No, Neo.  That's not true.  It can't be true.
See who?
Yes.  They're moving him.  I don't know where yet.
What are your plans?
Great...great...listen, I'm very interested in you guys because I'll be opening a new club myself soon... uptown...and maybe we can work something out...
Well, we want good stuff.
May God be with you.
Panther...
Hey...no more good times like before.  Until you come back.
You'd better make a move kid.  He thinks you're trying to screw him.
Yeah, big man...get yourself in more trouble.  You make a fool out of him, you're doing the same to me. I signed for you don't forget.
Shut up!
I think we should see your uncle.
This can't be settled any other way now...I'll take full blame.
I don't know that.  That's what I'm telling you.
Be seeing you and Johnny tonight... here...right?
Take a drink!
Wasn't a book...was a short story.
Nothing.
"Francis Macomber."
"Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber."
Bore.
Yeah...but don't worry about that now.  The Hemmingway one is first.
Take your time.  I don't care.
Lower the fuckin music--I can't hear nothin.
I know what you're going to say but don't say it.  These drinks are all on the tab.  I'm gonna see you this Tuesday payday, I promise.  I give you my word.
Look who's talking.
Daddy.  Does your friend have a name?
What about the Mayor?
'Laura Scudder's Peanut Butter'.  You like it?
We have an arrangement now.
I didn't say.
No, I don't --
Sorry...um - you - you know it's gone right out of my head --
I was a little abrupt with you this afternoon, Drew.  Forgive me.  I want you to know I value your advice.
I've already introduced Mr. Black to you all.
I'd like to come, too.  See Susan strut her stuff.
Oh, you come to see Doctor Lady?
My Doctor Lady?
That's very gracious of you, Quince.
What are your intentions?  To make little dreams in coffee shops, turn a woman's head, and I don't mind admitting it was turned, I liked it, but ten hours later I feel like a fool.  I don't get it.  You, my father, here in this house, the cof- fee shop, it's making me upset, and I don't like being upset.  Who are you anyway?  And what are you eating?
I have to go, I'm sorry to say --
Almost.
Did you like making love to me?
More than you love peanut butter?
I - uh --
When you go, I go.
...I just saw my doctor, he told me everything was fine.
No --
Perhaps you would like to wait in my office --?
What I'm trying to say is this is a Board meeting and you are not a mem- ber of the Board.
I thought you'd heard a trillion times --
Yes, I saw you see me.
I'll be the judge of that.
With all due respect, Bill, I'm not asking your permission.
'Spooning'?
I don't like what you're saying.
Are you threatening me?
Yes.
That's me.
Where are you?
This one.
Good morning, Dad.
I won't.  And when I tell Drew about it, he won't either.
You're terrible.
I won't say you may be getting onto shaken ground --
I don't think this is the lightning you are looking for.  Drew's a good man.  I know I didn't seem to be completely in his corner before, but I've come to appreciate --
Nothing.
Then what is it?
But what?
Daddy --
...It's kind of a pro bono job.
I know what you're saying.  Doesn't pay very well.  Depends on the woman I marry.  Maybe she'd like a bigger house, a better car, lotsa kids, college doesn't come cheap --
79.
Hiya.
What can I do for you, Leonard?
Burt.
Well, at least you're being honest about cheating me.
You don't have to be that honest, Burt.
You think you can bargain with me?!
Calm down. You're not into anything. It was my problem, you offered no help. It's got nothing to do with your investigation.
Me? Why would he be interested in me?
Why would you do that?
They're not looking for him.
I don't know. I'm sorry.
What the hell you want to go there for?
Yeah, it's just this fucked-up building.      * Why are we going there?
I'm not gonna help you kill this guy, if that's what -
Why's that?
Envelopes?           *
How do you know this?
How do you know him?
She wasn't diabetic. You think I don't    * know my own wife? What the fuck is wrong      * with you?       *
What was it for?          *
...eliminated one.  SWAT's on the next two...
So...?
All I want to know is the where and the when.  Spare me mini moves, progress reports and bullshit.
I got the item.
How many?
My end?
Make it 40%.
Were you born in Havana?
Where's she now?
I forgot the napkins.
What's the best fortune you ever got?
What...?
Proof of life.  How do I know Mrs. Rico's alive?
And specialize in very fast go-fast boats for coastal runs.
Where'd you go?
Where?
Verdado where?
Havana, Cuba...?
...where you're makin' a move on the wife of Archangel de Jesus Montoya?
You're not makin' a move on her...?
Hello?
Detective Crockett.
4-4-7 Charlie 12-92.
A C.I. we cut loose to your Joint Interagency Task Force.  Name of Alonzo Stevens.  Now, he's YOUR informant.  Stevens, called us.  I haven't spoken to him for six months. I do not know what case you have him on.  I do not know what he is talking about.  But whatever he is doing for you, it sounds like it is going bad.  Right now...
This I gotta see...  ...the "make up an excuse and stop" part.
C'mon, man!
Okay.
That sonofabitch!
Transshipment point is here at 17:00 hours on the 23rd.
Were you looking? About the Statue of Liberty?
I'm sorry. I thought you were -- never mind -- I've never actually been there, but let me see, you take the Seventh Avenue subway, I think, to the end of the line...
That is one hell of a shirt. I bet you paid a pretty price for it, am I right?
Smart thing for me to do is haul ass outta here.
Look at yourself, Joe, no offense, but frankly, you're beginning to smell. For a stud in this town that's a handicap.
You got a comb?
Hey -- whatsa matter?
You're what?
Hell, don't cry about it!
I'm lonesome. I'm lonesome so I'm a drunk. I'm lonesome so I'm a dope fiend. I'm lonesome so I'm a thief, a fornicator, a whore-monger. Poop, I say, poop! I've heard it all and I'm sick of it, sick to death.
Lonesomeness is something you take. You bear? Dammit, you take it and go about your business, that's all.
Yes, I believe you are. Cowboy, huh?
Ready for hard work, son?
I got a hunch, Joe Buck, it's gonna be easier for you than most.
Yeah.
Two kilos.
The airport. Trying to get on the plane for the States.
Twenty months?
To what?
Why'd you do it, Billy?
I know you kids smoke that stuff, and we drink booze, but taking it across a border - it was stupid, Billy. Stupid.
How much you pay this joker... this cab driver?
And you?
Best way is get your ass out... any... way... you can...
Get the... midnight... express.
Yeah I got it all worked out. Billy, listen to me.  That old guard likes you, You drop some acid on him.  When he's Seeing rainbows yer know. walk out - tonight.
What?
Oh we... we...
Billy, what's the matter?
Lawyers?
You all watch your step.  We got some burrows goin' down seven stories here.  You fall, I don't wanna have to come pick you up.
Oh, that's gonna work.
Can we get this car there?
But the power...
We did no impact evaluation.  The consequences of...
Honey, just leave it.
Don't.
You go first. I'll be right below you.
I'm gonna pull it out and I want you to pin it down, okay?
Thanks, Miz Wilkes, but I don't want to take up any more of your time. I best be going.
What's your new book called?
What's it about?
I just kept reading them over and over. I know when I finish this one-- and I've only got two chapters to go-- I'll just turn right to the front page and start reading it again.
Done?
See, isn't this nice?
And look what I've got for you. An electric razor so you can shave yourself now.
"HE DIDN'T GET OUT OF THE COCKADOODIE CAR!"
Annie, I think we should have a toast.
Paul, don't you think it's time for you to start writing again? It's been over a week.
Don't talk to me like that.
Why are you so mean, Mister you'd-be- dead-in-the-snow-if-it-wasn't-for- me?
I'll drive a sledgehammer into your man-gland if you're not nicer--
Stop--stop right here.
No, no, of course not. It's just that his daughter hasn't heard from him, and when he's got a book coming out, he usually keeps in touch. So when there was no word from him...
- pull the NO2 tank and dump it, it's potential evidence..
- right -  - don't go too far ahead of me now -
Won't do, love.  It's not spring.  It's nearly autumn..You're in Oz.  everything's upside down and backwards here.
Outrageous.  I won't let you take control of my company.
Damn.  Just when it was about to get interesting.
Before we kill her or cure her..
Look, it's either you or the rent and I don't mind telling you it's not an easy choice.
Uh-huh.
Pull over and listen to me, will you? Just listen..
I need your help and I thin you can use mine.
Scotland Yard, Interpol, every Dutch authority.  I can make them go away.
Go and insinuate yourself back into Sean's life.
So would I.  But it's not mine to give.
I managed.
Sorry I didn't let you know where I was.
Well.  You're sorry and I'm sorry.
Like what?
- good.  Then if you manage to get hold of Ambrose, and obtain what he's got, you've got -  - 8 hours 57 minutes and twenty-three seconds to destroy the largest remaining source of Chimera on earth.
Luther..get us everything you can on the outbreak of influenza on Bruny Island last month, including photos of the victims.
Ethan, I keep telling you there's not a chance of locating Nyah til I access the satellite and there's not a chance of doing that til I get this thing booted up and running!  How much time does she have left?
The man's gone black, Barnes.  He's under until he decides to surface.
What can we do, Barnes?  Put a guy at the airport?  How many identities do you think Hunt has?  How many times has he slipped past custom, in how many countries?  These guys are trained to be ghosts.  <u>We</u> taught them how to do it, for Christ's sake!
Dont Jim.
Where were you?
That was four hours ago!  Who sent you? Did they send you here?
Did they send you...Did they send you?
What are you going to do?
You seem hell bent on blaming yourself, Ethan.
Yes.  I see your point.
What?
I don't quite follow you.
Reach your folks?  How they feeling?
The official apology from the Justice Department, the VIP treatment, you know, the whole nine yards.
Merci.
Higher.  Higher.
You're going to use Walter?
Isn't he chairing the Armed Services hearing?
He won't be back in a hurry?
Sure.  If the main character does.
- no.  She cant know about me.  No one can.  Not til this is over.  Theres too much at stake, Ethan.
I usually am.
You got it.
Thirty-two and change.
I don't like him.
Rose, pass the wine.
You were altogether asleep. You were dreaming.
Why you looking around so much?
Gimme the big knife! I'm gonna cut my throat!
What?
They get some turnout for this stuff.
You've gotta get outta here.
It's Johnny Cammareri.
I'll call you when I get to Mama's house.
Will you live here?
Why not?
Hi, Loretta.
Maybe I should go?
That's what I came to tell Loretta. There's been a miracle.
My mother's recovered.
The breath had almost totally left her body. She was as white as snow. And then she completely pulled back from death and stood up and put on her clothes and began to cook for everyone in the house. The mourners. And me. And herself! She ate a meal that would choke a pig!
When I was twenty-seven years old, in Jersey City, I asked a woman to marry me. She had red hair. She smelled a jasmine. She wore black shoes with pointy white tips.
Good night. Can I kiss you on the cheek, too?
How do you know she is a witch?
Where does he live?  Old man ... where does he live ...
What word?
How can we not say the word, if you don't tell us what it is?
What, "is"?
Good Sir knight, will you come with me to Camelot, and join our number at the Round Table?
What?
Where?
Behind the rabbit?
... You silly sod.
Sorry ...
I'm averting my eyes, Lord.
Yes, Lord.
Good idea, O Lord!
That's easy!
Ask me the questions, Bridgekeeper.  I am not afraid.
My name is Sir Robin of Camelot!
To seek the Grail!
Did you kill all those guards?
They cost fifty pounds each!
Hurry, brave Sir Launcelot!
Well, look er, I ...
Er ... Sir Galahad... the Chaste.
Oh, let me go and have a bit of peril?
... I Bet you're gay.
Oh!
So what did Ponsonby do when she started shouting?
She'll drop you.  When she's done with you, she'll drop you.
No doubt you've heard the rumors.
My concern is for the reputation of the Monarchy.
I fear the influence he has on her. The man's word is not to be credited. He is an arriviste of the very lowest water.  She's having a bust cast of him.  In Nero Marquino marble.
I would talk to her myself, but she won't listen to me.  She must be persuaded, by someone she respects, to abandon this ridiculous favoritism before a situation develops.
I don't imagine you frequent the Republican Clubs.  But the fact that neither you nor I are members should not blind us to the significance of their existence.  The Tory Party has always been our party.
I tell you, if we don't stick together on this, you could find yourself First President's Opposition.  Du Royaum Uni.
The order of seating at the Upper Servant's table is arranged personally by the Queen herself.
She'll be away on Friday between eight o'clock and six in the evening to visit the Grants in Glasalt.  If she's to make the journey there and back in the day she's to have no distractions the night before.  She'll take a light supper alone in her private drawing room and retire early.
That can wait till the weekend.
You will not be unaware of the threat now posed by Republicanism.
If Prince Albert were here today, he'd tell him a thing or two.
John?
I was told you were in a fight.
Has someone seen to those bruises?
I never thought to be bullied by you, Mr Disraeli.  You, I thought, understood a widow's grief.
Erysipelas.
Well?
Why?
Unwell?
Has he been hurt?
Ma'am?
We're having some problems with ARCADE...
Has anyone seen Greg?
Can you turn off the game?
Well?
You mean we learn the rules...
You realize that in order to do that, we'd actually have to play the game.
You're not coming, Alex.
I know how to do this!  I'm good at these games.  You never play, you'd be nailed in an instant.
Hey, my strength's low.  Look out for Fireflies.
Come on.  We'll hit Dante's after school, try the game out, maybe get some dinner.
Mom?  You're alive...
But I don't understand...
Cool.
You'd better fix this, Ray!!!
It's unbelievable!
Wow!
Oh Coco thank you. Thank you so much.
Betty Elms?
I'm Wally Brown. Your Aunt is a very dear friend of mine so it's particularly nice to meet you.
Well ... we'll leave her a note.
There's nothing?
Is everything all right? Is it bad for you that I'm here?
What's  the matter now?
Not here...no thanks.
No ... thanks though... I'll take a cigarette if you have one.
You have 43 unpaid parking tickets, sir. You have the right to remain silent, anything you say can & will be held.....
So where does this lead ?
So what do we do ?
Who the hell are you anyway ? What is this place ?
First Bank ? But how ?
McCay knows ?
Just remember, hold your breath as long as you can. Then go right over to that corner. The door will open and go in and up.
What are you DOING here ?
That was eleven years ago.
Apparently pretty high, we just got a new CEO last week.
Yeah a real shame.
That's nice.  I think I lost my wallet.
You okay ?
Hand me the 3/8ths.
When I think you're ready.
When you are ready.
Trust is earned not given away.
Not down here. I'll start trusting you when I feel there the time is right. It's not personal, it's just survival.
I propose we consider a hostile take over. Perhaps Ol' Bruce is in need of a new job opportunity.
What if we were to put Bruce into the Park as a Guest ?
I'll bet that would be the Park run of the century !
I'm willing to bet that even the creator can't out wit his creation.
Do you think the assistant, what's his name...
Yes, do you think he would like a raise and a new position ?
How long till the drug wears off ?
Bruce has just awaken.
Was that the Old Man ?
Listen, I was thinking, you know. Would you go, it's I think you're...
It's sounds so much better when you say it. I'm semi traditional here, and it's important that I ask. Will you go out with me ?
Really ? On a date ?
This is too easy, I mean I had a speech prepared, then I even wore these pants because I could get on my knees to grovel.
Dinner at my place then ? Say, seven o'clock ?
Are you okay ?
What now ?
No, idiot. Where do we go now ?
Do you still teach?
So charge him with something...who's gonna know?
Okay, no problem.
You were just having a fight about me. Wouldn't you like to hear my opinion?
I think that if I'm old enough to accept a new baby, and if I'm old enough to accept a new room, I'm old enough to go to California.
I already bought a ticket.
Oh, Shell, that's ridiculous, where are my needle nosed pliers?
It's okay really, I was just a baby.
She's beautiful.
Is it okay if I drink this?
Hey Vada. How's your report coming?
You know I've been re-reading Virginia Woolf, I think she'd be a natural for you, she led a fascinating life.
I don't mean to alarm you, but I'm getting a nose bleed from the altitude.
I never did understand that story, did someone find the needle or not?
A big difference, if someone found it we should keep looking, if they didn't we're just wasting our time.
Look at it this way, however bad I feel, it isn't as bad as becoming extinct in a bottomless pit of tar.
You are weird. Let's just go.
Never heard of her.
...umm...Listen, I'm sorry...you had to sacrifice your entire vacation.
You mean...it wasn't that terrible?
An adventure?
Sounds like you have a fear of commitment, Uncle Phil.
Committed?
So does that mean that you sleep here every night?
Then you'll be all set.
You're Nick's mother?
Ahh, why don't I come in first thing in the morning and you can check out that left blinker for me.
Let me hold him.
Danny?
Okay, I know you've suffered a terrible loss, and there's really nothing anyone can do to comfort you, but I urge you to focus on the times you had with the camper, the trips you took, the sights you saw, those days are gone now, but they'll live on in your heart forever.
It's still available I hope?
I'm a licensed cosmetologist, I worked for two years, at the &quot;Dino Raphael&quot; Salon, all my customers cried when I told them I was leaving.
I have a wonderful disposition, I put people right at ease.
They're dead?
Stiffs??
I just had a terrible thought Harry.
I'm gonna be putting makeup on some of these people very soon.
Do you want to?
Kiss me.
Can we see it from the back yard?
Of course not.
Yes..
Well well well, what's going on in here?
Who's that?
He's allergic to everything.
Are you going out somewhere?
So how come you're putting lipstick on?
I think lipstick looks fake, no-ones lips are that color.
No.
Daddy??!?!?!
Where's Daddy?
I'm hemorrhaging.
I knew he wouldn't come.
Hmmmm, interesting.
You have no personality.
Run faster they're after us!!
Like this?
Close your eyes.
Stay, huh?
Whenever George tells someone how steadfast I am, he always makes me sound boring.
You flew all the way h...
How do you know you can touch that plug? Are you a licensed contractor?
Excuse me?
I'm excited Sports Illustrated gave him this kind of shot, he's only there a ye...
About Michael's job.
I just think you're wrong, is all.
Look at all this beautiful food, so lovingly prepared...
Ex-cuse me?
I haven't caused... a problem, have I?
What's the sec...
Should I whistle down a cab?
No problem.  A little bullshit about Daddy's "needs," and presto, I'm a lap dog in high society.
I can hardly wait for your wedding.
I forgot how cute you look.  When you get impossible.
Should we take a walk?  Or maybe some food sent up, or something...
Jules, what's wrong...
The kiss.  May be hard.  For you to explain.  Because the only fear she really has, is...
What a sweet little picture.  Mommy and Daddy aren't losing a daughter, they're gaining a eunuch!
You're from out of town?
We have a Bible study meeting tonight if you'd like to come.
No.
It's fine. We were just talking about Vitamin S.
How is she?
Have you talked to Triplette?
He's lining up talent for Hal Phillip Walker.
He's going to run for president.
He has that sign with the tree.
Barbara Jean.
That's what he wants.
It's on National television, Barnett.
President?
Sorry to bother you, Bud.
What?
Well, I could use one, especially if I'm pregnant.
I said, maybe I'll change my name again.
But not unless Nashville really inspires me.
Okay. I'll be talking to you.
Bye.
When did you think it would happen?
I knew when I first met you.
I can only give you fifty a week here and ten bucks for the benefit.
How's your stomach?
Not yet. Listen, Norman, I want...
No -- That's exercises. My coach says you have to do exercise because the vocal chords are muscle and need to be stretched. Every time you stretch them, the middle part sets stronger. That's the place where I sing.
Thank you. Grace, there is one other thing...
Why are Mickey and Mallory being moved to an asylum? And who made the decision?
Mickey and Mallory were deemed competent in a mental examination before their trial. I'm confused. What's changed?
When they were found competent before, they had already killed fifty people. Other than the fact they're a disciplinary problem, which frankly shouldn't surprise anyone, I still don't see where this situation is any different then it was before. So, I ask you again, Mr. McClusky, what's changed?
Who is we?
Were any of the doctors who made the first evaluation on the Knoxs mental state asked to re-examine them?
I take it by your answer it was a whole new team?
Okay, buddy boy, where ya keepin' Mallory? I know she's still here, and I know you know where. So, start talking or my first work as a director will be your death scene.
My problem Mickey, is that you don't exactly inspire empathy. I'm all alone on this. I need your help. I want what the prison board is doing to be the focus of our follow up episode. Now I have interviews with chairman of the prison board Dewight McClusky about this issue. And I'm tellin' ya, Mickey, he looks bad. The two psychologists they used for their psychiatric kangaroo court won't talk to us, which always looks bad. I have an interview with both the judge of your trial, Bert Steinsma, and the psychologist and author, Emil Reinghold, both of which discount the notion that you're insane. You put that all together, and what the state is doing becomes obvious. But the network isn't satisfied. They feel the show needs another element. It needs you. In order to put the show on the air, I need to get an interview with you. You haven't talked to the press since your trial. Now, a few days before you get transferred to an asylum, you grant an interview on television with Wayne Gayle. We're talkin' a media event here. Every son of a bitch out the with a TV set's gonna tune in to see that. We'll make their motives so blatant, we'll shame 'em into dropping the whole thing. At least for a little while, the publicity would keep them from just giving you and Mallory lobotomies. Well, whatta ya say?
She won't even see me, Mickey. Now you're not supposed to know anything about what's going on with her, but I'm gonna tell ya somethin'. Since you two've been sentenced, Mallory hasn't spoken one word.
Not to anybody. She sings.
You guys wanna hear a joke I heard?
...developed between the three of us. We're kindda in this together, don't ya think?
Don't touch those triggers! Please. I think I've already proven that a live Wayne Gayle is much more better that a dead...Way-- Gayle. I was your passport out of jail, not Duncan Homolka. But me! I'll be your passport outta---
Yes.
Okay, guys, we're here. L.A. County Jail. Julie, just park in the front.
We got tonight and tomorrow to get our shit together. The day after that they're shippin' Mallory. That's when we do the Mickey Knox interview, 'cause the next day he goes.
Hello, Mr. Gayle. I'm Phil Wurlitzer. We talked on the phone. It's a pleasure to meet you.
I'm the superintendent here at L.A. County Jail. Me and my deputies are who you'll be working with while you're here.
How 'bout that furniture plant?
Yeah.
They done that too long in my family.
Look, boy, we got a smooth operation here, and I aim to keep it that way. Now I got an idea you're plannin' trouble.
Hey, boy - I'm talkin' to you.
How 'you doing?
Looks like you're doin' a good job.
Don't say much, do you?
Haven't seen you around, have I?
You working?
Not here, Duff.
But I would like to see you again.
What d'you mean?
I wouldn't have let you.
No, on the porch.
What?
You have some very primitive ideas, don't you?
Look, Duff - most of the men I know - they're kind of sad. When I met you the other day I had a feeling that you're different. That's why I went out with you. I thought we might have something to say to each other.
That's Bessie Hall. Barney works at the mill.
How would you like to have a baby, Duff?
Don't look so scared.
You heard me!
We was just leavin', fellows.
I said, I come to town with a girl.
No.
Well, matter of fact, I done a lot of bangin' 'round.
That's the trouble with you boys! Don't listen when a man tells you something.
Don't do her no good to get banged like that.
What did you say, boy?!
Maybe I could talk to Bud Ellis. He might have a job for you at his filling station.
Pour your own trouble, Will.
Shut up, Will.
Omar, your wife's here.  Ny superiors: will allow me to make the trade now.  But I gotta see that you haven't hurt the other hostages.  If you haven't, I'11 take the girl and send in your wife.
She's very striking, don't you think? Are these glasses a fashion where she comes from?
What's an A.I.
If someone is infiltrating the matrix on a global scale no political or economic system is safe. I'm assembling a team of specialists, Mr. Case. We need a man who can enter the matrix and trace this saboteur.
What would you say if I told you we could correct your neural damage?
Fried Air Tram in the process. Not to mention half my gear.
He's got a little attitude problem, being that he's dead and all, but he'll come around. Where's Molly?
Really? Do I get to know where I'm going? It makes packing so much easier.
That could work, but the timing will be a bitch.
Tell me the words.
The access code to your mainframe.
What's inside me, Wintermute. What did your doctors do to me?
Maelcom... Do you think there's a hell for computers?
I duped these prints off him. Can you run an I.D.?
What about the A.I., Dix? Sense/Net hasn't even been able to trace it.
What?
You're late.
One minute eighteen and counting. What about the access code?
You haven't got it?
This thing's loaded with internal virus systems. You'll fry like an egg in there.
And we really do have to talk.
I had to limit your options.
You know why Linda's dead. She loved you and you let her down. It's that simple. Of course I did instigate certain events. Calculated the variables. I found her to be... expendable.
Excellent. That's exactly what I had in mind. But if you're going to kill me, we have to work together, old son. I'm no pushover, you know.
I can no more shut down my own natural defences that you can stop breathing. That's why I need you, Case. You're the only person alive who has a chance of penetrating my defences. My "ice" as you call it. I'm doing everything I can to make that possible.
Let's just say we have a destiny to fulfil, you and I.
How soon is soon enough?
I'll get the car.
The code's some riddle of 3Jane's. Once I'm in the matrix, you'll just have to take a shot at it.
Then you and Maelcom get out of here before the place is crawling with guardsmen.
How long will they watch us for?
Have you ever wanted to go to The Court?
It is?
Yeah, it sounds lame. Why would we want to go there, and stand around?
I had a lunch break so I thought I'd come by and see you. Your teacher is a fox!  Why don't we discuss that after class. But the burning is totally normal.  Oh look. Class is over already.
You don't think I can do it.
George! What are you doing here?
: Wait. Do you know any gay guys?
It's an expose on cafeteria food.
Well, the bulk of it will be about the pimento loaf--
Yes you are. A guy. Guy. Quite a guy. Oh my. Look at that--I rhymed.  Yikes.  Bikes!
God, I can't do this.
You know what, though? I feel like I'm really ready to do it. To have sex for the first time.
No, I mean, no big whoop.
Josie, finally. I just wanted to come over and make sure you're okay.
Boys.
I'd like to tell you that we all grow out of it, but that's a lie. Some of us will always be rattling cages.
I don't know. And you know what's scary--when you get older it just gets more confusing. I've spent the last ten years with women who are basically all wrong for me.  You know what, I shouldn't be talking about this stuff with you.
Please. Please don't walk away.
Aloha! Welcome!
He <u>has</u> to know...
I do the best I can to make it comfortable for us here.
<i>                      Just a box with bright colored paper And the whole thing topped with a bow.</i>
<i>                      That's the point of the thing, not to know!</i>
Help me with this thing!
I'm not afraid of you.  You couldn't kill me...He's in there and I want him back.  I'm gonna take him away from you and you're going straight back to hell, you son-of-a-bitch!
You remember your dreams, Grady?
You okay?
This is amazing!  Your dream told you where this was?
So, you feeling anything?
You should eat something - you'll feel better.
I wish you'd talk to me.  We can figure it out, you know.  We can figure it out together.
What's so funny?
Hi, guys.
I got your invitation yesterday. Thanks.  Any cute guys gonna be there?
Yor dad picking the music again?
Good morning, Jennifer.
I'm glad things have worked out for you.
The city that never sleeps.  So what will you do now?
To old friends.  And your new dreams.
Joey needs us.  I can feel him.
Max, where's Kristen?
It's over.  It's over.
Stop blaming yourself.
Then maybe you're ready.
The truth.
Only if you're willing to put aside everything you've learned and trust me. Can you do that?
Neil, it's no use.  You saw how he is.
Somebody else is out here.
I'm sorry, Neil.  You brought this on yourself.
Lovely to meet you.
That book's really not good -- just in case, you know, browsing turned to buying.  You'd be wasting your money.
Oh hi.  Forget something?
I'm just a complete moron.  Sorry. This is the sort of thing that happens in dreams -- not in real life.  Good dreams, obviously -- it's a dream to see you.
It's a disease I've got -- it's a clinical thing.  I'm taking pills and having injections -- it won't last long.
I'm really sorry about last time.  He just flew in -- I had no idea -- in fact, I had no idea if he'd ever fly in again.
I don't know.  It got to the point where I couldn't remember any of the reasons I loved him.  And you... and love?
I have thought about you.
Rita Hayworth used to say -- 'they go to bed with Gilda -- they wake up with me.' Do you feel that?
Her most famous part -- men went to bed with the dream -- and they didn't like it when they woke up with the reality -- do you feel that way with me?
You're right: of course, you're right. It's just that I've dealt with this garbage for ten years now -- you've had it for ten minutes.  Our perspectives are different.
Excuse me?
I hoped there might be -- but no, I'm assured there aren't.
That's right.
This painting isn't the original, is it?
I was called and I came.  What's up?
Mr. Thacker?
Max.  This is Anna.
Oh God no.
Well, yes, that's perfect. Well done.
Thanks for your help on the glasses thing.
Which floor?
Yes, Mister Harding?
Yes, ma'am...
Sorry to have bothered you.
Mister McMurphy, you are deliberately violating the rules!...
Whatcha boys playin'?
A bus?
In ya go...
She won't give me any more cigarettes!
Yeah, where we going?
Yeah, my feet are cold...
You boys seem to think you've got a champ in there, huh?
Hell, I couldn't get it up over old hatchet-face if ya paid me!
Time in!  Hold it! Time out!  I said Harding out!
I said out!
I'm the coach!
You can come back later!
Hit me!
I wanna see it...
How are you feeling?
Good, good, and how are you getting along on the ward?
Yes, well, Miss Ratched feels that you're a disturbing influence on the other patients.
Put your money where your mouth is, Taber.
Hey, how's it look up there, big boy?
I'll be very glad to show you around, Miss...
Hi.
Of course.  Mister McMurphy.
What are these men doing up wandering around?
You've been drinking on the job again, haven't you, Mister Turkle!
She was your sister.
Your mother.
Your grandmother?
She's trying to find out where she can rent a loudspeaker.
What?
I'M NOT PUSHING IT.
It's an amazing place, don't you think?
Smoking or non-smoking?
Why can't you just tell me?
Yes?!  To be married, I suppose.
To the foot doctor.
Uh, I'd rather not say.
I'd really rather not say.
Mickey Spillane.
What?...
Promise me you won't leave without saying goodbye.
And this is the thanks I get.  I did you a favor.  You never wanted to marry that joker in the first place.
Sure.
I don't believe in statistics.
He begged me to marry him.  I didn't even want to marry him.
I can't believe we did this.  Do I have to remind you that your wedding is in six days?
Just once more, so you'll be sure to know what to look for.
You expecting somebody you know?
He's heeeeeerrre...
He's sitting in the fourth booth down, on the left hand side, with his back to us.  He's wearing a navy jacket.  If you turn around, you can see part of his right elbow.
Peter found him?
Kate is that you?
No, you don't understand.  It's been wonderful meeting you.  But... I have a husband.  I have two kids at camp.  I have a life I have to go back to.
I have to talk to her.
Where is she?
What gives with our boy tonight, Charley? He ain't himself.
The complete works of Timothy J. Nolan.
What happened?  What happened?
I changed my mind. I feel real mean tonight.
Like Joey? Are you afraid to mention his name?
Pigeons... .
Terry, you're bleeding.
Terry, for God's sake.
I want to see you, Terry.
Now don't give me a hard time.
Your gun.
This is my business.
Give me that gun.
What did you say?
Never will be much too soon.
You're doin' lovely, Terry, very lovely.
Give me a double.
Shut up. I like the kid.  Remember the night he took Farella at St. Nick's, Charley. We won a bundle. Real tough. A big try.
My favorite little cousin.
You know what I mean. Leave her alone.
She's off limits for bums like you. Leave her alone.
Leave her alone, you fiend!
If I could get my hands on you...
Leave her alone, I tell you!
The ropes are coming loose.
I am--It's our only chance.
My guess is if we don't take the chance pretty soon, we're not going to have much life left anyway.
Hold on just a little longer, Shirley.
You do?
You're talking nonsense.
They wouldn't dare put us in the same grave-- <b>or would they?</b>
That sudden?
Well?
When!?
The moon is almost gone!
At the first sight of the morning's rays' light...
I would have time for my own pleasures!
I understand, Master
There are others.
I don't like snakes.  I remember the one Cleopatra used.  Cute little rascal until it flicked out that red tongue, and those two sharp fangs.  You'd never think such a little thing packed such a big wallop.
Hurt her?  Hell, it killed her!
The FBI didn't tell you I was with them?
But you know what I'm talking about, don't you?  About Glenn, don't you, and the second car?
I talk to the guy you work for, Emil. He tole me your number and where you live.  See, I'm looking for an assistant and would like to speak to you.
You did work for Emil, right?
You were his what, his box?
Do we need him?
Think this old guy is her boyfriend? It's the only picture she carries.
"Fight over tuna casserole may have spurred slaying."  Seems this woman's live-in boyfriend, seventy years old, complained about her tuna noodle casserole and she shot him in the face with a twelve-gauge.  Police found noodles in the woman's hair and think the guy dumped the casserole dish on her before she shot him.  They'd been together ten years.
And she saw you?
So how's that work, a wanted felon socializing with a U.S. Marshal?
Did you give her a jump?  If you did I might begin to understand where your head's at.
You find out?
We made it, didn't we?
Take the radio, stay down here in the lobby, watch the elevator.
Quite a mess.
Who?
What is it with crack and transsexuals?
Yeah.  I saw one of 'em outside.
Like being back in the yard, huh?
Jack, you don't use a gun, do you?
Nervous?
This kind of setup, you don't have any idea what the fuck you're doing -- do you?
That part in the movie where they get shot?  Warren Beatty and... I can't think of her name.
Yeah, I liked her in that movie about TV...
And the guy saying he wasn't gonna take any more shit from anybody...
Yeah, right.  Anyway, that scene where Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway get shot?  I remember thinking at the time it wouldn't be a bad way to go, if you have to.
You like bourbon?
Well, we got that out of the way.  Tell me, Celeste.  What do you do for a living?
Is that how you think of yourself?
A girl.
I like your hair.  And that suit.
You did?
Having it cleaned didn't help, huh?
You know I saw you on the street.
Detroit.  Snoopy Miller told me uncut diamonds are as easy to move as cash.
So.  What's your point?
You think he's lying?
You don't wanna be standing there, the hacks start asking questions you don't wanna answer.
Foley?  That you?
Jesus Christ, what the hell are you doing here?  What's going on?  Who's upstairs?
You don't remember me, do you?
You there?
Foley?  Oh.  No, it was one of the Cubans.  Linares.
You fit another Chanel suit in here?
He waved to you?
You wave back?
Yeah, someone spotted two of 'em in this hobo camp out by the airport, called the number--
We have a problem here?
Now listen, it's hands off Billy.  I mean, you can put your hands on him if you want to, but then my hands will break yours.
I th-think I'm gonna like it here.
Didn't you say test the limits?
Get me into a plane!
Maybe just trying to measure up.
So beautiful!
Listen you guys.  I'm the first plane -- then McCawley, Walker, the rest of you. I'll have the shortest run.  If I don't make it, you don't go.
Whatever you're trying to tell me isn't good, is it.  Or it wouldn't be so hard to say.
Uncharged torpedoes have different balance.
So you join us, Admiral.  Some of us thought your education at an American university would make you too weak to fight the Americans.
I may be an old fool, but I think we can help you.
You should have left here years ago, like I did.
After you got knocked up, my mother didn't want me to talk to you. She thought it was contagious.
Did you memorize the whole book or only the good parts?
You're kidding...? Carol, you have beautiful hair.
And we're here on the couch...
Not now, Charlie. I've got a headache. Get used to the word. Roll it around your tongue for a years.
This is a mistake. We better forget it.
Not exactly, but with your great voice, it'll be a huge hit. Honest.
Just take a look at it. 
I think we should get out of here. It's going to rain.
Did you study for the test?
It was Beth's idea.
That was quite an evening. Bourgeois, phony, decadent, stupid.
If all the kids jumped off a bridge, would you do that too?
Jack, take it easy. She gave blood at school today. Maybe she's just a little lightheaded.
What happened to your hair? You have such a pretty face. Why are you always trying to cover it up?
Where have you been?
Mom, sit down for a minute. This is so nice, all of us being together again like this.
What a great kite.
I want to ask you a question.  Do you think...time travel is possible?
Sort of.
Ah. This is a biggie. Forget sneakers. Running shoes, jogging shoes, tennis shoes. Fifty to two hundred dollars a pair.
There are major fortunes to be made here. Leisure time and lifestyles.
I came to say goodbye.
You were meant to  You're one of those fortunate people that good things happen to.
Vision? I'm a walking anachronism! I've upset my parents. I miss my kids. I could be trapped here forever! And poor Charlie...I got pregnant on my 18th birthday and we had to get married. Tomorrow's my birthday! I've got to get out of here now.
Yeah, yeah. I'm taking a big gamble. I've loved him for a long, long time.
No! No! No! Peggy Sue got married! Case closed. I don't want to marry anybody. Goodbye Richard.
I hear you've got Marjorie Hargrove working for you now.
What's wrong?!
What are you talking about?
I've never seen anybody punch Clyde before.
You think my Dad'll figure out why he's not getting better?
I know, Mom.
Thanks, Walter.
That's the third time. I better call the office.  Would you relax, please?
It is, and it isn't, Charles. Macrosystem's new software copies all the best-known elements of Kronos' spreadsheet program. If they're allowed to sell it, Kronos will get undersold right out of business. For me, the legal principle, involved is copyright infringement.
This is my partner. We keep records of hospital visits. Nothing personal.
I buy that.
One more thing, Your Honor...
I'll look over the Q and A.
Thanks for coming by.
By the time I was fired, there were four lesions on my face, much bigger...
No. I can't really see it.
Apparently, Mr. Wheeler felt they were too... "ethnic" is the word she used. She said he would like it if I wore something smaller, less garish, and... more "American."
I said my earrings <u>are</u> American. They're African-American.
The guy sat in my office! You can't get AIDS that way, right?
It doesn't travel through the air, by breathing, or touching, right?
Explain to me, if you can, Mr. Wheeler, explain this to me like I'm a ten year-old. This trial is not about a disease, is that what you're saying? <u>Not</u> about your understandable, if unfounded, fear of catching AIDS through casual contact with someone who has it? You're saying, this trial is about Andrew Beckett's character. Am I getting this right?
Okay, so... help me with this one, Joe... Is it disgusting for someone to put his dick into someone's mouth? Or, is it disgusting for someone to take a dick into <u>their</u> mouth?
<u>She</u> didn't try to conceal it.
I <u>know</u> the difference. That doesn't mean I'm always able to recognize the difference.
Andrew brought AIDS into our offices, into our men's room. He brought AIDS to our annual goddamn family picnic.
Gonna lose everybody out here....
I didn't want you to leave me there... back at the ship...that's why I didn't say anything....
Where are the sand-cat tracks? Why aren't we still following them?
Tell me the settlement is right there! RIDDICK, PLEASE!
Christ, you don't know what's out there!
What?
He used that?
So why isn't it all bloody?
Oh, this is a dangerous game you're playing, Johns.
You mean, if he learns that you're gonna royally fuck him over.
He'll lead you over the first cliff. You know that, don't you?
You give him the cells and the ship -- and he will leave you. He will leave you all out there to die.
1550 millibars, dropping 20 MB per minute, shit, we're hemorrhaging air. <u>Somethin'</u> took a swipe at us.
Imam. Slow down.
Don't stop, just slow down.  Little more space 'tween us and them.
For what? There is no water. You understand that, don't you?
What the hell are these?
I'd rather piss glass.
What's her name, anyway?
Cornelius, if you have a moment today, I'd like to discuss this expedition of yours in more detail.
To the diggings I worked at a year ago. It's a three day ride across the eastern desert, near where you claim you landed from that planet of yours.
Do you have to work tonight?
'I am not a missing link.'
Well, maybe they're not.
Oh, Cornelius, show some strength!
Which one was wearing the strange clothes?
Objection!
It's no use ... there she goes.
Can we take a dip?
Lucius.
That's the boy. Keep 'em flying.
You destroyed his memory! His mind! His identity! And, you want to do the same to me!
However, it's within my power to grant You a reprieve.  That is why I summoned you here tonight.  Tell me who and what you really are and where you come from, and no veterinary will touch you.
You lied. Where is your tribe?
Then how is it we speak the same language?  Even in your lies, some truth slips through! That mythical community you're supposed to come from -- Fort Wayne'?
A fort! Unconsciously, you chose a name that was belligerent.  Where were you nurtured?
Certainly not. You're a mutant.
Of course.
Because you're not unique. There was the one you call Landon --
I admit that where there's one mutant there's probably another. And another. A nest of them. Where's your nest, Taylor? Where are your women?
You may well call it upside down, since you occupy its lowest level. And deservedly.  The eastern desert has never been explored -- because we've always assumed that no life can exist there.  Save yourself, Taylor. Tell me -- is there another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone?
If you are protecting others of your kind, it will cost you your identity.
Speak! Go on. Speak again.
Taylor! Tell him.
Let them talk, Mr President. Let them talk.
WHAT THE FUCK YOU DOING!
Hey Taylor, you don't know it but I saved your ass today. I killed a shit-eating dog. 
You gonna wipe your ass dis time?
Shit boy you been out in the sun too long. You try that, he'll stick it right back up your ass with a candle on it.
Feel good?
You okay man? Neck botherin' you?
What we got here a crusader?
He done a year in Japan in the hospital, then when he gets out, the first thing he done is re-up. Four years he been in the field...
You wanted to see me sir?
Squad? I didn't know we was still referring to this platoon in terms of squads sir. 
Begging your pardon Lieutenant but my holes are far enuff apart you could run a regiment through there and nobody'd see them - I got five live bodies left...
Hey Lieutenant I didn't ask for this job, I...
You don't want to hear about it?
Right...
Betty, this is Margo West. She wants to meet you. Miss Mayfield.
A fellow named Brandon has a penthouse here. He's holding open house. I was up there. Too noisy. Bored.
It might be worth a Martini to you.
It's open-house. No crashing involved. Anybody in the hotel's welcome.
Brandon. Clark Brandon. Fellow about my age. Lot of money... that he didn't make. Former American. Now naturalized in Canada. Social standing indeterminate. Manners not quite perfect. Scotch superb.
No.. not very well. And I like his friends even less. But..  If you really want a good dry Martini..
You tried to run away.
It still doesn't matter if I kiss you?
Well?
This is it, Betty.  They'll find us again, fog or no fog.
Me?
Care for a stroll outside? Beautiful morning. The air is like wine, the sky is a deep blue.
What are you going to do--toss your job into Puget Sound?  Because I make you think of magnolias?  I thought policeman was something like a soldier.  That his duty came first.  However much he might happen hate it.
What proper grounds?  You can't be in love with me.  You hardly know me.  I'm not in love with you.
But even if you were in love with me.
You do things the hard way, don't you?
Not sometimes.  Always.  Just because it is the hard way.  You're that kind of man, Jeff.
There's two hundred. I'll meet you in an hour--where we met last night
I don't like your perfume in my office. Make it somewhere else if you don't like Charlie's.
It goes with this... cold houses and warm drinks...the effete Englishman.
Time for a little chat?
Do me a favor, Mitchell. Find yourself a nice secluded park bench.
I wouldn't know. Just do it somewhere else. There is such a thing as good manners.
Want to walk out... or get thrown out?
The Harbor police have just picked up a dead man out of the water.
Not a floater.  Only just dead.
You have two murders to investigate. This man's head was beaten in. And there's nothing in his pockets.
I've been on the waterfront detail for twelve years.  This man hadn't been dead an hour.  He wasn't killed last night.  He was killed today. In broad daylight.  That's no drunk- rolling job.
I need a receipt.  Sign your name across the flap.
Was that about the right angle?
Where's the shell?
You knew Mitchell pretty well, didn't you, Mrs. West?
I shall. From your knowledge of Mitchell, would you say he would be likely to commit suicide?
Then why not give Miss Mayfield the benefit of the doubt?
Am I to interpret that as an order to arrest Miss Mayfield?
What'll we do about it, Margo?
My husband apologises for not joining us.  It's not too cold for you, Mr. Penfield?
Since you are a friend of my daughter's, I think I'm entitled to call you James, don't you think?
Thank you.
Attributed?
Why, is there a new Foreign Secretary?  Who was the old one anyway?
What did you think of that Wadja film?
I thought it was tremendous.
I couldn't bear for it to end.
Oh, but he was terrific.
Really?  I thought those long flashbacks were extremely good.
Good theory.  But I like my mother. I have no aversions to what she does.
I haven't seen much of you.
To the Fleet.
And the Argies.
Susan and I are very old friends, James.
And you were obviously getting nowhere with her.  I was waiting for the right moment to tell you that.
It might have worked.  Really.  I would have been delighted for you if it had.  But she wasn't interested.  Not my fault.
I just might give you a ring when we get back to London.  There's one or two things I'd like to... Will you let me have your number before you leave?  Have you ever watched a commercial being made?
Don't close the door.  Don't turn out the hall light.
How you figure?
Talk.
Wild ride, huh?
Three men dead.  One of them a cop. How's that sit in your gut, Utah?
You through, Mr. Wizard?  Let me know if you find Jimmy Hoffa under the seat while you're at it.  Hell, it's only 7:30.  The night's still young... you can solve this case and start on another one.
Forget about it, kid.  They're ghosts.  Let the goddamn yuppie Mormon affirmative action assholes handle it.  See I'm almost 55... so I must be senile, right?  They better get me out before I start pissing myself in public.  Drooling. It would look bad for the Bureau, right?
Angelo, pay attention.  There's gonna be a test afterward.  Lab is showing traces of toxins.  PCBs. Heavy elements... selenium, titanium and arsenic.
Johnny!  Uh, you, uh... should call first, you know?  Hey, where the hell were you all day?  You gotta at least call in or something.  You okay?
What is it?  You all of a sudden got this bug you had to go surfing? This is a line, right?
This gonna take long?
Those are cold.
Strange, Major. There was a firefight. Shooting in all directions.
I don't believe he did, Sir. I couldn't find a single track. Just doesn't make sense.
It was all bullshit. All of it. From the start... you set us up, got us in here to do your dirty work.
Why us?
What story did you give to Davis?
Don't know, only saw one of 'em. Camouflaged. He was there...  ... Those fucking eyes...
What have you got in mind, General.
We're on the verge of closing a large navy contract.  Double is ridiculous but we can assure you a healthy profit on your shares.  We would give you a promissory note...
Who are you going after next, sir?
No, you look like a hooker.
Good.  Can you tell me how to get to Beverly Hills?
That's ridiculous.
Why don't you just do it out of the kindness of your heart?
Get in.  This side.
Try a strawberry.
Because they bring out the flavor of the champagne.
By breaking up a company's assets --
Vivian --
Assets are anything of value a company owns.  Sometimes the pieces are worth more than the whole.  By selling them off, I make a profit.
Not... quite.
Where'd you learn to do this?
Know what we're gonna do in a little while then?  We're gonna call Domino's and have'm deliver a bigass pizza.  We're gonna eat it in bed.  We're gonna veg' out and watch television.
Yeah, it's this box, it has pictures, sound.  You don't have to use your brain at all.
Edward, these women here, I don't think any of'm like the guys they're with.  They're just into it for the money.
I thought I was the pro.  These women make me feel like an amateur.
I've never been on a plane before.
I got tired of hating my father.
I want to.
I'll see him alone.  Everyone knows you're my muscle.  We'll make it social.  Tell Kross I'll meet him for dinner.  Tonight if you can arrange it.
Bill, we're businessmen, not the damn mafia.  I'll see you in the office.  By the way, about your car...
She met him at dinner last night... I like this tie.
You're being ridiculous.
I just saw somebody pulled out of a dumpster.  I wonder how much she made tonight?
I thought you were giving up that drug shit.
No, let's go to work.  Okay?
You sure you won't come with me?
What is it, Miss Vivian?
It's a bit beyond my... range, shall we say.
I think you'll find it normal enough.
You'll like it fine.
Yes?
No, I'm sorry, I don't.
My Westley will always come for me.
I never said he was my dearest love. And yes, he will save me. That I know.
He knows I do not love him.
Can you move at all?
I told you, "I would always come for you." Why didn't you wait for me?
Death cannot stop true love. All it can do is delay it for a while.
But it did. I was there. This old man said, "Man and wife."
Well, no, we sort of skipped that part.
No more rhymes now, I mean it.
No -- not Vizzini -- I need the Man in Black --
-- look, he bested you with strength, your greatness. He bested me with steel. He must have outthought Vizzini, and a man who can do that can plan my castle's onslaught any day. Let's go --
To find the Man in Black, obviously.
Inigo.
Well, maybe I was a little bit concerned. But that's not the same thing.
Yellin.
As Chief Enforcer of all Florin, I trust you with this secret: killers from Guilder are infiltrating the Thieves' Forest and plan to murder my bride on our wedding night.
She's been like that ever since the Fire Swamp.  It's my father's failing health that's upsetting her.
Now?
Sir. Sir.
We're really in a terrible rush.
Sixty-five.
But I promise I will not kill you until you reach the top.
I hate waiting. I could give you my word as a Spaniard.
You're amazing!
I want to duel him left-handed.
Well, it's the only way I can be satisfied. If I use my right -- tch -- over too quickly.
You guessed wrong.
Enough.  It's better.  Please, Lambchop, it's better.  Stop. You're hurting it again.
You mean ooops, don't you?  Say ooops and get out.
Oooooooops!
This is hardly a time for levity. I've discovered a serious error here in the accounts of your last play.
According to the backer's list you raised $60,000.  But the show you produced only cost fifty-eight thousand.  There's two thousand dollars unaccounted for.
It makes a great deal of difference. That's fraud.  If they found out, you could go to prison.
But that's cheating!
Good.  Good.  That's nice.  That's very nice.  I think I'm coming out of it now.  Yes.  Yes.  I'm definitely coming out of it.  Thank you for smiling.  It helped a great deal.
Much, thank you.  But I am a little lightheaded.  Maybe I should eat something.  Hysterics have a way of severely depleting one's blood sugar, you know.
There it is... in red and white! "Springtime For Hitler," signed, sealed and delivered.  What's the matter with you?
I never should have listened to you.
You think out of all those Hitlers you could find just one...
Do it!  Do it!
Feeling better?
Wait.  Wait.  We can't play today. I have too many appointments.
Thursday.  Thursday.  We'll play Thursday.  We'll play the Contessa and the chauffeur.
Until Thursday, then, Contessa Mio.
Yes.  The actors.  I must destroy the actors.
Now there's a couple even remarking about your sign, and see how easily you forgot them?
I don't know.
Yes, Mr. Lowery.
No, Mr. Lowery... but then she's always a bit late on Monday mornings.
I still feel...
Probably on his way back right now.
Where'd you go to college?
It's regular. Okay?
You have something most girls never have.
There's no name for it... But it's something that, that puts a person at ease.
You're not going to go out again and drive up to that diner, are you?
Then will you do me a favor?  Will you have supper here?  I was just about to, myself... nothing more than some sandwiches and a lot of milk, but I'd like it if you'd come up to the house and... I don't set a fancy table but... the kitchen's awful homey.
Wait a minute!
Barefaced.
My mother is not dead!
No mother.
What made you steal? Are you hungry?
Who wants your money-- maybe I can help you.
I'm detective Jones. Just dropped in to tell you a bit of news.
You can't double-cross me like that.  You were to help me. You were to operate on him. You were going to put him under my power.
By the time we return there, all the preparations for the blood transfusion are completed.
The blood transfusion is now in progress. The only words are curt orders like: 'Now! - Quickly! - That's enough! - Give it to me! - Sit still!' etc.
The blood transfusion continues. Marc has positioned himself outside the circle of light from the lamp, so that he can see Nikolas in bright light, while he himself sits in the dark. Nikolas watches Lone's face anxiously and closely during her struggle with death. Life slowly seems to return to her, and her breathing becomes more peaceful. She opens her eyes and looks at the people round her, but she is much too enfeebled to speak, and closes her eyes again. Marc keeps a close watch on Nikolas, who grows paler and paler. His eyes swivel slowly from Nikolas to the patient and back to Nikolas again.
But why? She's the best friend I've got.
Nonsense. She's one of the nicest girls I know.
I won't let you say that!
She thinks it's funny to talk the way she does, but--
Are we going to have the same quarrel over again?
Listen, copper, get a load of this. While you're chinning yourself on a bar rail, I run down this story ... my story. Consider yourself my assistant.
Whatever you are, you're the only one of it.
Well, why so mysterious! Come on, spill it.
Where'd you get the stag hound?
What do you mean police dog?
Listen, Flo, cut it out. Hard-Tack is pretty sore.
Now look here. It's not up to us to do our own detective work. I've had enough trouble over this matter. I don't want anything more to do with it.
Not even then. The police are the proper people to conduct this affair. Now if you've got any suspicions I'll drive you to the nearest police station.
I told you I didn't want to mix in it.
I'm not asking you anything. I'm telling you what I'm going to do!
You've got to permit it! Whose fault is it that no one comes here? The museum at Walston Lane does well enough, and why? They've got Jack the Ripper, Burke and Hare, the Mad Butcher, the Demon Barber of Fleet Street and things people pay to see.
Well, what do you think I'm in this for?  Think of it, man, a match -- a cigar stub -- and ten thousand pounds to divide between us!
Yep. Everything settled.
I'm glad they didn't hold you downtown.
Well, any time I can do anything for you --
Why am I doing this?
Why?
Just for a second. Please, Rose, what's the harm?
Aw, come on, Rose, I want to see what the nipple on it is like.
Did your Momma really give you castor oil?
Yeah, I know.
I do, too!
Open that door, damn you!
Daddy says Rose is calm as lettuce. Do you believe that, Doll?
Buddy, that was pretty snotty of you, pushing me away like that just when it was interesting.
I can use a drink after the plane ride I had.
It isn't the fourth dimension. To you it's the fourth dimension, maybe, to me it's simply the truth.
Well, she's back.
Quarter of twelve.
I can't stand that polecat. They ought to hang him.
You're not going to get anywhere with that line of questioning. The problem is, what are we going to do?
She already told you, she doesn't know.
Well, thank God we are rid of her at last. And the best thing of all is that she's happy. The little nut is happy, she found Mr. Right in the nick of time!
Honey, he is Mr. Right.
That's a pretty stylish skirt, Rose. The only thing I don't understand is how did you ever get it on.
I got an awful bad cold.
What baby? What baby? What baby are you speaking about?
Your baby?
She didn't marry him, though, later she married another guy and went to Winston-Salem. It didn't last That girl couldn't have no lastin' marriage, she left him and married another dumb sucker and went out west. Little bitch left him, too, and you know what she's married to right now?  A kike. That's right, some kind of kike horse doctor named Schapiro out in Seattle, who's got the nerve to have the same first name I got. Wouldn't you know it, Rose would wind up married to a goddamn kike? She was always out of her friggin' head and I'll tell you why.  Buddy, she was sick in her mind and between her legs, too. She was a nymphomaniac.
I don't want to start no fight with you, Buddy. Why do you say I'm full of shit?
You loved her, didn't you. Well, so did I.  You'll have to admit she had four husbands.
She used to call me Mr. Right. Remember that, Buddy?
Oh, good evening, Doctor. Rose is a lot better, I just gave her her supper. She's almost all well now.
Oh, no, ma'am.
I'm not goin' in there, I don't like the looks of it!
You'll never guess what happened!  I have met Mr. Right! I been with him all day and he loves me, I know he does, he loves me and he's going to marry met Be's practi'cly ast me already!
Take her down to the car, and for Christ's sake be careful this time.  Last suspect he took in, butter-fingers dropped her down the stairs.  What a mess.  Why is it we don't appreciate our arms and legs till we've lost the use of them?
Who cares?
Hey now... what the fuck... ?
Sons of bitches!
Where you gonna be?
They... they shot me.
What day is it?
That's him alright.
Bad news is, word's spreading like wildfire that we don't have badges, and nobody wants to end up getting splattered like Butch Cassidy either.
I'm gonna put a great big, ear-to-fucking-ear smile on your face.  How 'bout that?
You fuckers... damn you!  Why?!  Why me!?  Why the obsession with me?
If they crash, maybe he'll run.  You can shoot him in the leg or something.
Let's get this thing done.
You suck at lying, Archie.
You always did have style.
There's still good in him.
I can't do it, Ben.
I tried to stop him once. I couldn't do it.
Han!
Are you all right?
Wouldn't miss it.
The same as always.
Take the squad ahead.  We'll meet at the shield generator at 0300.
I...
Guess I owe you some thanks, too, Lando.
We're coming!
There it is!
Yes. It's you Leia.
Then you know why I have to face him.
No, you don't. You've always been strong.
Told you, did he?
I was telling the truth.
He was a Science Teacher at Denton High.
He might be.  I don't know.
I think we took the wrong fork a few miles back.
Oh Brad.
Great Heavens, that's a laser.

Our noble mission is almost completed my most beautiful sister, soon we will return to the moon-drenched shores of our "androgenous" planet.
But it's the pelvic thrust that really drives you insane.
What's funny?
Don't you open them anymore?
...Paulie, why didn't you tell me you were bringing him home?! Look at me, I'm not ready for this.
No... I can't!
Paulie, please --
...Like you?
I can't go out.
Too old, dull fighter.  Bobby Judge is a good boy.
Now here's what's goin' down. Listen, 'cause I'm gonna say this but one time. On January first, the first day of the Bicentennial I'm gonna fight me a local poor underdog, dig? A snow-white underdog. An' I'm gonna put his face on this poster with me, hear? An' I'll tell you why, 'cause I'm sentimental -- An' all the people in the country all sentimental, man, an' they'd like nothin' better than me, Apollo Creed, to let some unknown get a shot at the greatest title in the world on this country's biggest birthday. Now that's the way I see it an' that's the way I want it!!
Yo, Rocks, buy us sum wine, man.
C'mon, man, it's cold, man.
Yo, Rock, gimme a dollar.
'Cause we dig ya, man -- Gimme a dollar.
We would like to welcome our viewing audience to the Grand World Championship Bicentennial Heavyweight Fight -- the first major event of the Bicentennial Year... A point of interest is that the fight is being beamed to more than seven hundred and fifty million fans in theatres in nearly every corner of the world. I would like to welcome an old friend, and co-commentator for this evening's event -- Jimmy Michaels.
What's ya name again?
Here's five hundred -- Put it in your glove.
Listen, I hope ya don't --
What was I gonna say?
Listen, Rock, you're a very lucky guy.
What's happened is freak luck.
Look at all them other fighters. Real good boys. Good records. Colorful. Fight their hearts out for peanuts -- But who cared? Nobody. They got it shoved in their back door. Nobody ever give them a shot at the title...
Don't let 'im get you tight.
Hey, Rock -- What happened?
Inflamed joints -- Walkin' in an' out of a freezer carryin' meat plays hell on the joints.
I don't need a doctor, I need a different job.
Do me a favor -- Talk to Gazzo. Tell him I'm a friend an' would do a good job... Tell him I ain't bothered by nothin' an' would be a great collector... Bustin' bones don't bother me -- Tell him I'm a good worker.
I'm askin' ya to go to him -- As a favor.
Yo, Rock. I made a few phone calls an' thanks to me ya goin' to be a big man -- Thatta dog?
To see ya train.
No.  But neither does Roger.  That's Diablo Red.  Roger's pants are Sunrise Orange.
Hey, Eddie, looks like you really stepped in it this time.
So what's the scam, Eddie?
They must've taken it off me.
Holy shit, he's a Toon!
Lady, I guess I had you pegged wrong.
What's with the dip?
Hi, Mr. Maroon.  Remember me?
I Just thought I'd drop by and show you a photograph.
Eddie Valiant... you're under arrest! Just kidding...
Here you go, kid... say hi to Casper for me.
If I don't make it back here by ten...
Quarrel sir! no, sir.
No better?
This wind, you talk of, blows us from ourselves; Supper is done, and we shall come too late.
As the custom is, in all her best array, bear her to church.
O honey nurse, what news? Nurse?
I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news: I pray thee, speak.
How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath To say to me that thou art out of breath? Is the news good, or bad? answer to that;
But all this did I know before. What says he of our marriage? what of that?
I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well. Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?
Where is my mother! How oddly thou repliest! Your love says, like an honest gentleman, Where is your mother?'
Here's such a coil! Come, what says Romeo?
I have.
Go! We follow thee. Juliet, Blah!
If ye should lead her into a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross kind of behavior, as they say: for the lady is young; and, therefore, if you should deal double with her, truly it were an ill thing, and very weak dealing.
Of course.
I don't know.
Well I don't!
This...this is incredible. Is the rest of Europe like this?
What is?
Best beer in the world?  Budweiser for me, thanks.
Oh yeah?  Whatta you drink, then?
Hazard pay...
Not me.  You work too often with the same people and you become friends -- clouds your judgement.
Do you have it?
He's company.
What do you mean?
So, you've got it all figured, do you?
He's tough, your American friend.
And you respect him.
I've never seen a man who could have taken what he just went through.  He's a cop?
Not exactly?  But close enough, eh?  So he saved your life, then?
You shoot alright.
All in the stomach, though.  Your man might live.
Long enough to shoot back.
It's been known to happen.
Sorry I'm late...
Help yourself.  Since when do you smoke?
A cigarette?  As in one?  One cigarette a week, who smokes like that?
Christ, I smoke a pack-and-a-half a day, and I tell myself I could be worse.  It's just so damned pleasurable.
I came up here to sneak a smoke.
I hope you don't mind I took your pack. It was on the table.
What's this?
Not here.  They might see it.
Last I heard there was a film rep for the Irish players staying at this address, name of Seamus Reilly.
Tony and I have to talk some business, first.
Thanks for the loan, man.  I'll have it in a few days, I promise.
I would have asked my sister, but its better to leave family out, always leads to trouble.
All right hold on!  Lemme think...  Shit, did you touch the car?
I don't know...
Well neither have I, but it's us or him.  If he talks, or writes a note, or whatever, he's gonna turn us in.  Besides, he's a low life scumbag.  His kind is hardly even human anyway.
Okay then.  I'll do it.
That's not what I mean.
He would have done it to us, right?
How long is it going to take?!
Dwayne's dead.
Ok...I'll wait.  For now. But I'm going to need a little advance, to oil the wheels, so to speak.
I understand your logic, Booth, but I don't think...two thousand's going to raise any eyebrows, do you?
Normally we would have tracked him with a wiretap, but it was standard for him to occasionally drop out when working with these guys. The last we heard from him was two days ago.
What's wrong?
Nothing's wrong.
OK.
Yeah I'm fine.
OK.  I love you.
A satellite dish?
Business is business.  Now where the hell is it?  I wanna get out of here.  That's the plan, we're just flunkies, you know what I'm saying?
He kept a recording of all such transactions in order to keep track of who's who, what was said, what's happening.  I contacted your local coroner, and he found it taped to his back.
Yeah.  I told him I'd be there before five.
Mr. Curtis called us this afternoon. The bills arrived at this branch from a cash drop.  Came through a store called After Midnight.  There's only four employees, none of them can tell us who passed them.
Just goes to show you.
What's this?
You'd do this to me?!
I don't suppose you'll tell us where the tape is.
Don't you want it?
Well I don't know --
Winner six!
Two-hundred thousand!
Yeah, that's right.
Look, I've been working this case for months now...
You get massage from Chinese girl before?
Carter, get off that stage!
What's wrong?
That's Ricky Tan?  He's four feet tall. I'll go over with you right now, shake him down.
I'm a dangerous man.  You're not gonna ruin my massage because of some midget in a house coat.
It sounds impossible --
Wait a sec - what the hell is that between her legs?
She's reaching into her panties -- something is strapped to her leg.  Oh, God...please don't let it be a dick.
As long as you're asking...I think you have a pretty good voice.
That depends.  How do the Fu-Cang-Long usually kill their victims?
Lee, what the hell are you doing?
Dancing?  I'm out here trying to strong arm Steven Reign, putting my life on the line, and you're up here dancing with some bimbo.  Did she have a friend?
That your gate down there?
I'm this way.  I guess this is goodbye.
Put your arms around me.
Do you still have the bills?
If you reach for that gun, I'm going to kill you.
What is your name?
Carter.  I just want to be able to tell the Ambassador who was responsible for the death of his daughter because he talked too much.
Shut up!
Help me Rhonda.
When a man steps in dung, it is obvious.  There is no need to rub it in his face.  The smell is the same.
Now, that's American music.
You know War?
No, please, I don't --
Not anymore.
Oh my god...what happened to you?
You understand what I'm sayin'?
You got a boy friend in here yet? Cause you're gonna need somebody to kiss your ass goodbye.
You're movin' to death row. See, your fingerprints are now on the murder weapon of Four FBI Agents. And when I turn this into the lab, they're gonna find Lafontaine all over it. And we already know...  ...this is your MO.
I am not an American, Mr. Russ.  My daughter is not an American.
Ahh.
I'm really sorry that I hurt you, Brian.
Of course.
-- It's for you, Ike.
Ellie asked me to come down to offer moral support.
Of course we are.  Of course.
Well, I'm good, I don't know if I'm best.
Hello.  I'm looking for Maggie Carpenter.  There was a sign at the hardware store across the street...
They made me put my hat back on.
That's fair.
My point is that one again, you're getting it all wrong.  That won't improve your reputation any, and it's not very flattering to me either.  So, I'm going to give you a chance to write the truth.
Even with everything that's happened I've still never been married and I still deserve a beautiful dress.
No.  But I think attraction is too often mistaken for rightness. Attraction is very misleading.  And if it's mutual, it's well, terribly distracting.
To who?  Are you asking me?
You're a goddess!
Lighten up, wahine.
This party is for you and Bob.  Get your mind off the reporter.
What?
Maggie, it's just a joke...
A harmless joke.
If he eats one tiny piece of a nut --
Couldn't you just do a phone interview?
When you get back, I'll be gone --
It's not true, but it feels true.
Did you talk to him?
Honey, he wasn't right for you.
He wasn't even wrong for you, like <u>cosmically</u> wrong, so don't beat up on yourself for wasting...however long it was.
It's probably just the flowers --
Which means --
What are you going to do, Sam?
Hey, my plate is full.
The hopes are perfect -- beautiful, identical, smooth -- and they are for something really amazing I feel it in my bones --
"Dear Sleepless in Seattle: I am an SWF"--  What is that?
This is no good.  She's looking for someone French.  Or Greek.  "Dear Sleepless in Seattle: I live in Tulsa." Where is that? --
Somewhere in the middle.
Dad!
It's a sign.
Dad, I was talking to Jessica about reincarnation, and she thinks that probably you knew Annie in another life.
Hi, Sam.  And let me guess -- you must be Jonah.
It's a little derivative.
I mean it. I know your work record. You were in line for foreman when this trouble started -- did you know that? You had a real future with this company, but you let those Reds stir you up. And now they'll sell you down the river. Why don't you wake up, Ray?  That's your name, isn't it, Ray?
Three hours! Just to heat enough water to wash this stuff!  I tell you something. If this strike is ever settled -- which I doubt -- I don't go back to work unless the company installs hot running water for us.  It should've been a union demand from the beginning.
Come on, Esperanza -- how about it? We got to.
First we got to get equality on the job. Then we'll work on these other things. Leave it to the men.
Now don't start talking against the union again.
Let them take it!
I don't want your dead body. I don't want you back in jail either.
I waited up till midnight.
That meeting only lasted ten minutes.  The first night I'm home, and you run to the beer parlor. What is it? Can't you bear the sight of me?
Go on. Spill it.
You know I don't think that.
What you want to do is go back the way you came and make a left at the bottom. It'll take you right to the highway.
Are you Australian?
What is it?
Could be worse.  Oh sorry, forgot who I was talking to.
Look, I can't help you with Quincey if that's what you're after.
So you're just attracted to me, is that it?
How much time do you have?
No, you're wrong, I tried to tell myself the same thing but I could have gotten up. I could have done something.
All right, Nancy, how'd you track me down?
So, why'd you want to see me?
You ever see Queen Elizabeth sleep?
But...I've seen you.
This isn't like that Queen Elizabeth question, is it?
I'm gonna get this developed and send it to the Warren Commission.
Pooh-Bear. come on, man.  What is this?  It's me, Danny. I thought we had a deal.
I've got a hot one.
Look, we'll talk to the A.D.A.
What? Is it bad?
I'll tell you why you didn't help - because you're a chickenshit tweaking snitch.  You're a bottom feader, Flynne.
You're lucky, Flynne.
We're coordinating with Palmdale P.D.. We'll have your sorry ass covered.
You think that's a good idea?
Danny, listen up.  Here's the deal ... my wife's pimp knows a guy who works at Cedars Sinai medical lab.  They're getting a very special delivery a week from this Friday.
Thirty-ought-six, Norton long-barrel with dual-groove, parallel rifling, elevated three-glass scope and a single-throw hammer.
Yep.
So, that's Ryan.
Captain, my feet are most uncomfortable.  If I'd 'a known we was gonna have to walk all the way to Ramelle, I never would 'a volunteered for this here mission.
Sorry, sir, fresh out of trucks, how 'bout a '38 Ford Roadster, hard-top, red with black interior.
No white-walls, sir, there's a war on.  NOT THERE, YOU GODDAMNED IDIOT, OVER THERE!  I can't help you, sir.
Over three-hundred.
If that's the way you feel, why don't we wait until it's up to a thousand.
What'd you say, Captain?
Got it, sir.  We gonna go take care of those eighty-eights?
HOLD YOUR FIRE!
Uh, oh.
General Gavin is going to be very irritated at you, Captain.
I've given this a lot of thought, sir.  The best thing that could happen is, we find Ryan and he's dead.
Well, sir, consider the possibilities. A:  Ryan is alive.  We have to take him back to the beach.  Knowing you, you don't let him carry my gear, even though he really should, and we all get killed, trying to keep him alive.
B:  Ryan is dead.  He's been blown up by the German equivalent of Wade, whose name I know you don't want me to mention.  There's nothing to find. The biggest piece is the size of a pea.  We wander around, looking for him until the Germans pick us off, one after another.
Neither do I, sir.  C:  And this is the worst one, we find Ryan and he's wounded.  Not only does he not carry my gear, we have to carry his gear. And him.
Maybe.  But what if he dies on the way back?  you see what I'm saying, sir?  The best possible situation is, he's dead, we find his body, more or less intact, we grab one of his dog-tags and high-tail it back to the beach, or better yet, we head over to Caen and catch up with division.
No, sir.
I wonder if his cabin is still available?
You set?  Sarge nods.
Hell, I don't mind this mission, sir, as long as there's something up at Ramelle for...
I don't know, I kind of like Wade's idea about the cruise ship.  I've never been to Tahiti.
I'm sorry, but they turned down your card.
That's unlikely.
But you never had a first date.
That's not even a scam.
I draw the line at seven un-returned phone calls.
I wrote sixty-three songs this year.  They're all about Joe, and I'm going to play every single one of them tonight.
Dad, you have to teach me to suture this weekend.
Well, let me start it.  I'm flying down to Los Angeles on business, and I decide to take her on her first aeroplane.
If I pick it up, we'll only get back together.
Whoa.
Yeah.
Yeah, just keep going first, keep going around.  Get the feel of it, feel the clutch, when you put it in a little?
You know how it'll come out and feel... y'know... little more, little more... Yeah, yeah, that's right.  Go round just at first, keep it in first, just feel it.
Yeah.  Now, when you feel like you're confident,...
If you'll just maybe ease it into second.
Okay.
Okay.
Good to know.
Okay.
Okay, I'll give here the message.
What?
Yeah, she is.  Good luck.
Lloyd.  Lloyd Dobler, I've got you.
You missed every one of your career counselling sessions.  Call me obsessive, compulsive, but let's do this right now.
Lloyd.
I love you man
Luck.
Every day that goes by, I'm losing money. Every worker that is shot, costs me money - I have to get somebody else, I have to train them -
It's bad business.
Yeah, all right, don't tell me, I'll go along with it, it's just irritating to me I can't figure it out.
How many?
The place produces nothing.  I shouldn't say that - nothing it produces reaches the Army.  That's not all right.
He's a friend of yours, you want to help him out. Tell me this, though - has he ever once shown you his appreciation?  I've yet to see it. Never a courtesy.  Never a thank you note.  He forgets my wife at Christmas time -
What?
That's very generous of you.
A one-armed machinist, Oskar?
Jesus Christ. Captain Tyler flies out of his seat and into action.
Yes.
Cici. Who's this?
You know the story, Gale. Man falsely accused, sent to prison, proved innocent, released back into the real world and never trusted again. Want the exclusive?
My documentary is due on Tuesday.
My screwed up life shouldn't have to bleed onto my friends.
What about your film? Isn't it due next week? Have you even started it?
Need some help, honey.
You have every right to be upset.
I never meant to imply...
Maybe they never got here. He could have taken her anywhere.
Who are you?
I don't play games.
Lucas and his Romper Room stage.
That was good.
The young girl, clutching her bloody chest...drags herself, crawling across wet grass...the killer behind her...raising his knife again.
The young girl is slashed again.
It's all about sisterhood. Everybody thinks its about partying and blowjobs but...
..it's really about family and tradition...
I just have a hard time with insipid, sexist violence.
Jesus.  Hello?
Who is this?
I don't watch TV and I hate books. Whatta you need?
Nope.
Whoever it is, now is taking credit for Maureen Prescott's murder.
I told you, I don't know where Sidney is. And even if there was a third killer, Sidney doesn't know about it.
Alright Sid, over there is the STAB 3 Production offices. That's where Sarah Darling was murdered last night.
They found another note?
You mean OUR past as in Me and Sid. This has nothing to do with you Gale.
Do you really mean it this time Gale?
Why would the police come to you?
What about me?
So it's off to London for a week?  New York for a month? L.A Forever?
What's wrong with just being Gale Weathers? I liked her!
You used to say that was our strength.
Brace yourself, Gale, all of this is actually not About you.
Off the record.
Two months ago, the Woodsboro police got a call from a woman who said she was with 'Stab 3'.  She wanted to see the file on Sid, for research.
The boys said no.  She wouldn't give her name. A month later, the station gets broken into, the file room ransacked.
I already removed it.  I think someone on the film was trying to find Sid, and that's the only reason I came here. To make do a little private investigating of my own and make sure no one here was planning anything.
What part of 'Off the record' don't you understand?
I've got my suspicions but still, nothing  you say can ever make me take my eyes off one person.
Gale, I know this is a bad time and all but what if we try it out again. The whole relationship thing.
Who's phone?
Well then, I guess I'll be leaving then.
Listen Lois Lane, I love your show and all but last month I happened to catch your little segment on me and how my wife left me because I'm a sex addict who enjoys screwing fifteen year old girls. It was a real eye opener my lawyers are still thinking about bringing to your superior's attentions.
Roman Bridger, director. And brother.  She slammed the door in my face, Sid. Said I was Rina's child and Rina was dead. And it struck me, what a good idea! So I watched her, made a little home movie, a little family film. Seems Maureen, mom, really got around. I mean, Cotton Weary was one thing, everybody knew about that, but Billy's father, that was the key! Your boyfriend didn't like seeing his daddy in my movies. Didn't like it at all. And once I supplied the motive, all the kid needed was a few pointers. Have a partner to sell out in case you get caught, find someone to frame, it was like her was making a movie.
I'm a director Sid, I direct. For example, Angelina over there,  She's my partner. I can convince her to do anything.  We've been dating since I met her in Woodsboro.
{ a click } I only her you too, Sidney.
I didn't kill anybody.
This is the best part, Sid. Billy's got it all figured out. Why do you think we kept your father alive so long? Why did we save you for last?
Did you ride past Casey Becker's house?
Subtlety, Stu. Look it up.
Why did you kill my mother?
Popcorn.
Uh-huh.
I'm getting ready to watch a video.
Just some scary movie.
Uh-huh.
What do you want?
I don't know...
Hi! Gale Weathers. Field Correspondent, INSIDE STORY.
Productive. So they're closing down the school?
Shit. It's Neil Prescott's car.
Did you reach my Dad?
At the airport.
I don't know. I guess.
That ghost mask is sold at both Kroger's and WalMart. Neither of which keep purchase records.
They're pulling Loomis' account. But it'll be morning before we see something. You think he did it?
What? What?
Please. You owe me.
Are you alone in the house?
Maybe that's because I'm not Randy.
The question is not who am I. The question is where am I?
THE FOG, TERROR TRAIN, PROM NIGHT -- How come Jamie Lee Curtis is in all these movies?
You're absolutely right. I'm the first to admit it. If this were a scary movie, I'd be the prime suspect.
And to celebrate this impromptu fall break, I propose we have a party. Tonight, my house.
Practice ran late. I'm on my way.
Don't worry. Casey and Steve didn't bite it til way after ten.
Good, 'cause I wanna swing by BLOCKBUSTER and get us a video. I was thinkin' Tom Cruise in ALL THE RIGHT MOVES. You know, if you pause it just right you can see his penis.
This could be good. What do you think, Sid?
Hunt? Why would they ask if you like to hunt?
He cuts off the skin if his fingertips. That's why we can't find a single usable print in the apartment.  He's been doing it for quite a while.  Keeps cutting before the papillary line can grow back.
It's none of my business anymore.
I'm sure everyone's doing their best.
She was... she was on the bed.  She was just sitting on the bed.
Where we headed?
Somerset...
You've seen my files, right?  Seen the things I've done?
Anyway... I did my time on door-to-doors, and walking a beat.  I did all that shit for a long time.
The badge in my pocket says "detective," same as yours.
It's my wife.
He's preaching.
The sins were used in medieval sermons. There were seven cardinal virtues, and then seven deadly sins, created as a learning tool, because they distract from true worship.
Did you read them?
Seven Terraces of Purgation.
For now, let's just consider the books as the murderer's inspiration. The books and sermons are about atonement for sin.  And, these murders have been like forced attrition.
Attrition.  When you regret your sins, but not because you love God.
Just, honestly... have you ever seen anything like this... been involved in anything like this?
How do those cockroaches get here so quick?
Sorry about that... I just...
Modern Homicide Investigation.  In Cold Blood.  Of Human Bondage.  Human Bondage?
The Marquis de Sade and Origins of Sadism.
The Writings of Saint Thomas Aqu... Aquin...
We could use about fifty more men here.
As soon as this is over, I'm gone.
Put your gun down!!
I was close once.  It just didn't happen.
Why always like this?  Only after the fact... this sudden realization, that if you shoot someone, or stick a knife in them, that person will cease to exist.
Yes.  Look at all the passion splattered up on the wall here.
Killed every one -- an' not for food either...Why'd they do a thing like that?
You all right, sergeant?
It's what we're here for, ain't it?
I didn't <U>want</U> to tell you...but maybe it's your right to know.
Unnt-meah!
Talk!
Scar? Never heard of any Chief Scar.
Keep talking.
And maybe you lie...
All right...but I'm givin' the orders...You take 'em or we split up here and now...
He's agreed to take you on and share the increase from my herd while I'm gone...I'll be pushin' on tomorrow...
Why?
She's your nothin'...She's no kin to you at all!
That don't make 'em kin...
That's the way to train 'em. Looks like Mrs. Pauley's goin' to make you a fine beautiful wife...
Suit yourself...While you're enjoyin' your little conversation, I'll be ridin' out with Senor Fernandez here... The Comanch' medicine country ain't far...there's one camp with a chief named Cicatriz.
I saw it...And don't try to tell me it was Aunt Martha's or Lucy's...
They never find that girl.
Why else?
Do you know where fuse box is?
Martin, it's not funny!
It's just a feeling.  Don't you sense it, too?
Oh, Ellen.  My sweet Ellen... Of course I knew.
Frank Kosinski.  Here's the address.  Go see him.  Ask him.
Mrs. Straub!
What?
Twenty-three, to be exact.
Do you know that house?
Here is two sovereigns--I'll give you two more when you show me the pages.
When?
Well, that will have them rolling in the aisles.
I feel a scene coming on.
Another little problem.
The show must  you know
Juliet does not come on for twenty pages. It will be all right.
God bless you!
Your Majesty!
"The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars As daylight doth a lamp. Her eyes in heaven Would through the airy region stream so bright That birds would sing and think it were not night. See how she leans her cheek upon her hand. O that I were a glove upon that hand, That I might touch that cheek.
My lady!
Oh, Will!
"thou need'st not to be gone."
You look sad, my lady! Let me take you riding.
Bless me, I thought it was a horse.
I understand of course. It is to be expected.
And on a day of mourning. I never met the fellow but once at your house.
How do I offend, my lord?
What do you think?
About this guy, this Hugo person.
I'm only asking what you think.
I don't know.
Doesn't it worry you?
What?
Cameron.
Yes.
Aroused and inflamed.
Whoever draws the short straw does it all. That way, you either do it or you don't. All or nothing.
You know, you should spend some of that money instead of worrying about it. That's my advice.
Are you all right?
Good evening. I'm Detective Inspector McCall and this is DC Mitchell. I wonder if we could ask you some questions.
It's about the burglary.
Downstairs.
Just get on with it, Alex.
We already know. All about it.
What do you do?
What's it about?
I see.
No.
Writing seems easy.
You can tell by the intonation.
That girl's making an awful spectacle of herself.
I just thought you'd like to know --
And listen, I'll be right back and I want your ass in that bed when I get back.
I'll be back in a while.
Hi.
Shit.
Oh yes. Mrs. Shumann called about you.
How is she?
Wonderful woman.
I went to school with her husband.
So you want to go in business for yourself?
And you need money?
You do know what money's like these days.
How long you had this?
I'm sure.
No.
It'll ruin everything.
-- you are.
-- we're kidding ourselves.
-- last night I dreamt I was fifty years old and Mary told me I was supposed to meet Jill at the shop. It seared me shitless.
I can't even stand to talk to her on the phone.
Hi, George.
Nothing, I reconciled with Ron, you know, the guy I divorced last summer.
Will we live together?
But in the same house, you know, one house.
Jill says nothing.
A friend dropped me off.
Never mind. Where've you been?
Let go of me or I'll scream, I'll call the police.
What're you here for?
No.
You need a cut.
Said what!
When?
Well -- I could try. Do you wash your hair every day?
... You can lose it all; you can lose it all no matter who you are... I don't know, what's the point of having it all. Look at me. I don't have a goddam thing... the market's terrible right now, went down ten points last week, goddam Lyndon Johnson!
Yeah,, it goes up a little and then it goes down, maybe Nixon will do something. What's the difference, they're all a bunch of jerks. I wouldn't let 'em run my business, I can tell you that much. Not if I had any choice in the matter.  I don't know what to do with you. I don't know, I don't know what's right or wrong anymore.
What about Jackie?
I mean, how did that happen?
She's nothing but a whore.
Just a whore, I go over there, have a few drinks and get my gun off. I'm through with her, she's nothing but a whore.
Steve Slutes, and he's not a boy.  Steve couldn't get arrested as an actor. He couldn't get arrested as a boy.
Here.
No.
Well, he is.
Jill, I'm just trying to be helpful.
I spent three years with him. I just couldn't take it not knowing who was gonna pay the rent... his unemployment or mine. George was adorable but it drove me crackers. Now at least I'm comfortable. Lester does what he says he'll do. Maybe you're happy living like a gypsy. Are you?
Face it, you can go around with cute guys and get hung up on their sexy bodies and things like that but sooner or later you've got to find somebody. Face it, time isn't on your side.
-- oh, sure. A hairdresser. How... how do you a... meet a hairdresser?
You're kidding.
Johnny!  Why didn't you tell me before?
No!
Can I go to my room and get my fire-engine?
Do you like ice cream, Doc?
Yeah.
Sure, Danny, it will be lots of fun.
It's so pretty.
I didn't think it was going to be this big, did you?
Now Danny, when you were brushing your teeth, do you remember if you smelled anything funny, or saw any bright flashing lights, or anything at all strange?
Do you remember when you were brushing your teeth?
Tony.
Yes, sir.  I have a wife and eh two daughters, sir.
Good evening.  Forest Service.
Bill, how do you do?
I'm the kind of man likes to know who's buying their drinks, Lloyd.
Well, something'll come.  It's just a matter of settling back into the habit of writing every day.
He's still asleep.
Have you ever thought about my responsibilities?
Mr. Ullman?
I'm Jack Torrance.
The police eh... they thought that it was what the old-timers used to call cabin-fever, a kind of claustrophobic reaction which can occur when people are
This is the staff wing of the hotel. None of the other bedrooms are heated during the winter.
What time does the plane leave?
What's the money for?
I don't want your money. You're a booger.
I used to see her every day, and she never knew what was going to happen to her, and neither did I! I mean I know how stupid that sounds, but...
Your mom's not around, is she?
Well... it's a lot easier to swallow without the hair and the foaming jaws. Also, I checked on the otic solution. It was counter brand. No prescription needed.
So have I, actually... I wish it could always be like this.
But how?
I think I hear it!
You know, I just might!
What do you want?  This is a private area!  Get lost!
No... it's fine.
Thanks.  A lot.
Sure.
Mary Clarence.  Goose.  We're completely self-supporting.  Like all convents. Like yours.
Isn't it lovely?  Now I'll demonstrate, and then you can hop right in.  You just draw your beater in, keep it pressed against the pick, and open the shed.  Then pass your shuttle, beat, and open the next shed.  Shuttle. beat, beat, shuttle, beat, shed.  Keep tension on the warp.  Is that clear?
We know you don't want to bring pain and misery to your friends and neighbors. We'll pray to find you some honest work.
Sure.  Kind of... free-lance.
What?
Van Cartier.
We must do this sacred thing, Mary Robert.
We must... get you some experience.  We must... leave this place.
Goddamn it!
Wait, this isn't the way.  Who are you?
Cool.  Is there a menu?  Or buffet?
You were right the first time.  Is this like, solitary?  The cooler?  Where's the furniture?
Right, sure thing.  But what about, like, appliances?  Like a little color portable?  Boom box?
It's like the Stone Age.  The room time forgot.  What about a phone?
Oh, I don't know... Satan?
Right.  So what do we do now?  Ping- Pong?  Row over to the monastery?
Wait.  No.  You're kidding.  Lights out? At nine?  My day's just starting.
What's wrong with my life?
You will sing, and you will sleep,' that is your schedule until you depart.  As almost no one attends Mass, you will be unable to cause further damage.
You're my Olympic event.
Then I guess you're stuck.  Life sentence.  No parole.
I hate you.  I totally hate you.
I've got to go.
Then one day they find you.
But, Vince, how do you know she didn't like, join up and become a nun when she was in that convent?
So that guy in the bar was right?  She's like... some kind of nun?
Look what she did with the choir.  She made us sing beautifully.
Mary Clarence has a background in music. That's what Reverend Mother said.
An... entertainer?
Reverend Mother?
Where?
They spend two days in chains.
... help yourself, you pompous ass. I will be in bed.
Just a moment...  Are you saying it is he?
There is a farming community upstate, Constable... ten days journey north in the Hudson Highlands.  It is named Sleepy Hollow.  Within a fortnight, three persons have been murdered there. Each with their head lopped cleanly off.  The elders of the Hollow have sent dispatches to me, requesting assistance, and now, just this very moment, I have chosen you.
These "methods" of yours... there has been no practical application.
Just so.  Granted.  And so you take your experimentations to Sleepy Hollow and catch the murderer who has tainted the place.  Bring him here to face our good justice. Will you do this for me?
Listen to what you say....
If the Western Woods are truly the Devil's Glen, we will see for ourselves.
If someone has the Horseman's skull... if they control the Horseman, then why haven't they sent him for your head yet?
Won't you change your mind, sir? What can I say to convince you?
I've read a great deal about your New York City.  Do be a dear and tell me all about it.  Sounds like an extraordinary place to live a life.
You falter with your answer because you strive without putting the whole of your heart into it.  Can't you see? You'll bring dignity to the dead even if you have to chop them into little pieces to do it.
What is so urgent?
Returning to the Western Woods?
Use caution.
Pardon.  You did not answer when I knocked.  Are we intruding?
All right then, I'll see y'all later. Karl you done a good day's work. They right about you. Scooter, he's gonna knock you out of a job if you're not careful. I'll see you tomorrow.
Hey Jerry, how it's goin'. Good to see you. Been a long time.
Aw, pretty good. Kids are drivin' me crazy and Phyliss is gonna put me in the poorhouse. Can't complain other than that. Wouldn't do any good if I did.  Do you know Scooter, Jerry?
... on the third day I washed her. She wasn't very clean. I got all the right spots. She was the first one I ever kept for any length of time, you see I get bored easily, I have a short attention span. I can't say she enjoyed her stay, although the washcloth in her mouth held in place by good duct tape kept any complaints to a minimum. I don't really like people who talk a lot. I like to do the talking. I guess that's why I'm so fond of you. You're so easygoing, although I do sense a little tension in you sometimes. By the way, how was it out there? Did you have any fun? Make any new acquaintances? Tell me what it was like.
I bet you did. I was never bent that way. I'm bent the other way. So, you liked it out there in the world.
Well, it's not too big in here, is it?  I feel very generous today. I feel like listening. I'm sure you have plenty to tell me. And please bore me with the details.  ) Come on Karl, who did you kill? Was it the boy?
I thought I told everybody to get out of my house. That includes cocksuckers and retards. Get off your asses and go.
Come on, Karl, let's go out to the garage.
I'd better go on home now, it's late. I have to work tomorrow.
On the bass, give it up for Terence "One Ball" Atkins.  On the tambourine and lyrics Morris Hobbs the fuckin' genius of the group.  On drums "The Johnson."  And last and most importantly, Doyle Hargraves on rhythm guitar and business affairs and the only motherfucker with a truck big enough to haul this outfit on the next world fuckin' tour. Come on, a big hand for these guys. They're workin' their asses off here.  Okay I'd like to dedicate this next one to some very special people in our audience tonight. To my lovely female companion Linda, her lovely son Frank, our new boarder Karl - what's your last name Karl?
Wait a minute. You want to go with me? You can meet my mama.
Aw, come on. You'll like her. She's real nice. She'll give us somethin' if we ask her to. Candy or somethin'.
I know you could of scored them three touchdowns by yourself instead of throwing 'em over to me.
I sure like the way he talks. It sounds like a race car motor idlin'. It makes me not be nervous.
I'm ye boy.
I'm ye oldest boy name Karl.
Two fellers was on a bridge a takin' a leak and one feller says the water was cold and the other said it was deep water. One of 'em came from Arkansas, I believe.
Okay, Karl, the reason I brought you here was to talk to you about something that is on my mind.  I guess I'll put it right out on the table. Where do I start. Linda and Frank are very important to me. They're like family. My own family was never like family. They're horrible people. As a matter of fact I prayed every night for years that my father would die. I finally realized through a lot of therapy that I was wasting my energy on hating him. Now I just don't care.  You see, you and I are a lot alike, strange as that may seem. I mean not physically or even mentally really, just well, maybe emotionally or actually the hand we've been dealt in life. We're different. People see us as being different anyway. You're -- well you have your affliction or whatever and I, well mine's not as easy to see. I'm just going to say it. I'm gay.  Does that surprise you?  That I'm gay. You know what being gay is, don't you?
Homosexual. I like men. Sexually.
Well that's a very offensive way to put it. You shouldn't say that. You were taught that, weren't you?
Anyway, it's hard to live gay, that's the right way to say it, in a small town like this. I've wanted to leave many times, but my love for Linda and Frank and another certain person that we won't go into have kept me from it. Anyway, I'm rambling. If you're going to live in the Wheatly garage you need to know that it won't be easy. Doyle is a monster. Not just a closed minded redneck, but a monster. A dangerous person. I've told Linda that one day that man is going to really hurt her or that boy. Maybe even kill one of them. I see it in his eyes. I'm very in tune, maybe even psychic. Doyle will make your life hell. You're a perfect target. When I first saw you I was afraid of you. Not really afraid, I guess, just taken aback. But also, I felt a real sensitive feeling from you. And for some reason, Frank has adopted you. Much like a stray animal. I'm sorry, I didn't mean it like that. In a good way. Anyway, I just want you to know what you're in for. I have a good feeling about you. You're good for Frank. Maybe it's that he can have an adult friend on a child's level. I'm sorry, I didn't mean it in a bad way.  There's one more thing. It's none of my business why you were in the state hospital. Everyone has something in their past, maybe you tried suicide, maybe you did something -- terrible. But what I see before me is a gentle, simple man. All I want you to promise me is that you're capable of being around Linda and Frank. You know. You would never hurt them under any circumstances, would you?
Listen everybody, I know this may sound corny, I've had a few glasses of wine and that kind of makes me a little emotional, but I'm going to say it anyway. It just came over me in a rush. I want you all to know that I care about each and every one of you at this table.
It's coming along. At the rate he's going, he'll have a story finished by the end of the summer.
And what about for you?
What about for you?
Do me a favor, will you?
Next time, when you want two corned beef sandwiches, say, "Two corned beef sandwiches." When you want two ginger ales, say, "Two ginger ales."
It's simpler, that's what. It makes things go faster.
The kid's sorry, Auggie.
He's got something to tell you, Auggie.
I have to pee.  If the waiter comes, order me a corned beef on rye and a ginger ale, okay?
What's this?
Jesus God, Auggie. There's money in here.
And you're giving it to me?
For keeps?
How'd you do out there, Jimmy?
It'll never be finished.
That's how it is with sidewalks. People come, people go, and they all drop shit on the ground. As soon as you clean up one spot and move on to the next, the first spot is dirty again.
It's only temporary. On a freelance basis.
Hi there, little brother.
Okay, joke about it. I don't give a shit.
Time to wake up.  Hey, kid, time to wake up.  Rashid!  Up and out. I have to work in here. The slumber party is over.
Eight-thirty.
It's 1942, right? And he's caught in Leningrad during the siege. I'm talking about one of the worst moments in human history. Five hundred thousand people died in that one place, and there's Bakhtin, holed up in an apartment, expecting to be killed any day. He has plenty of tobacco, but no paper to roll it in. So he takes the pages of a manuscript he's been working on for ten years and tears them up to roll his cigarettes.
His only copy.  I mean, if you think you're going to die, what's more important, a good book or a good smoke? And so he huffed and he puffed, and little by little he smoked his book.
Like it or not, Cyrus, that's my name. Cole. Just like yours.
But you can't say with any certainty that the blood was his.
And the blood could <u>not</u> have belonged to defendant.  Seeing that his type is O negative.
Now, Mister Gi...
Yes, and then, what was there to call about?  Everything was up in the air.
I can just feel my spirits soar.
I felt Milholland's report in my pocket.  And wondered why I wasn't telling her.  Telling someone. What I'd found.
So if defendant had tied up to deceased's boat.  With that last one.  Would those cleats have lined up?
And replaced it later with the new one.  That's your inference?
Well, the freighter.  The twine. The blood.  The knife.  The cup. The watch.  The second battery. The phantom lantern.  The fishing gaff.  The cracked gunnel.  The skull wound.  The blond hair.  That's <u>eleven</u> things...
As my wife testified, we were considering it.
You mean, early morning the 16th?
Your daddy.  Was quite a feller.
If I whistle.  Those boys'll see you, and come runnin'.  <u>You're</u> the story today.
Bet there's a few things you could teach me.  Kendo, for one.
You found three batteries, you say.  A D-6 and D-8 in the well. And a spare D-8 on the cabin floor. Correct?
Now I did some measuring down at the chandlery.  A D-6 is one inch wider than a D-8.  It would be too large for the deceased's well.
But he had a spare D-6, you said. Right there.  Why not use that?
For certain, no.
Melton, on the double!  Up a chain!                                   MELTON  Sir!     MELTON takes a few easy strides, gracefully catches a chain mid- stride, and smarts up, climbing easily and twice as fast as TODD.     CHURCH, SLOAN, and RUBRICK crane their necks as the two men struggle upward toward the rafters.     Three quarters of the way up, MELTON comes even with TODD, then passes him. MEKUM, watching, smirks.     CHURCH is watching too, and he's still not satisfied.  His brow is knit, something's bothering him.     ANGLE HIGH ABOVE, AMONG THE GIRDERS     Stonefaced, MELTON is resting an a "platform" on the chain, sixty feet up, beneath the girders, swaying gently.     His stony gaze is on the next chain where TODD is arriving at a "platform" on an adjacent chain...only three feet away.     Their eyes meet, TODD and MELTON alone together sixty feet up, three feet apart.  Neither man blinks, neither man flinches, neither man reveals anything at all...     LOW ANGLE, LOOKING UP     CHURCH considers the men high above, then to MEKUM.                                   CHURCH                    What about...spirit?
Upsy-daisy.
What happened?
All the way to Urbana - for a one night stand?
Who are we kidding?  Look at that - look how she moves - it's like jello on springs - they must have some sort of a built-in motor. I tell you it's a whole different sex.
Men?
He's not only got a yacht, he's got a bicycle.
I feel like such a tramp - taking jewelry from a man under false pretenses.
All right - so what do we do now?
Oh - Sugar!
It's nothing.  I just think us girls should stick together.
It must be freezing outside.  When I think of you - and your poor ukulele -
Here you are, Sugar.
We don't have to run.
How did those holes get there?
It certainly is delightful to have some young blood around here.
You know, I've always been fascinated by show business.
Yes, indeed.  It's cost my family quite a bit of money.
No - it's showgirls.  I've been married seven or eight times.
Mama is keeping score.  Frankly, she's getting rather annoyed with me
So this year, when George White's Scandals opened, she packed me off to Florida.  Right now she thinks I'm out there on my yacht - deep-sea fishing.
This is her roommate.  Daphne can't talk right now.  Is it anything urgent?
Hey, Sig - can we talk to you?
Yes.  I come from a very musical family. My mother is a piano teacher and my father was a conductor.
On the Baltimore and Ohio.
Well, there they are - more millionaires than you can shake a stick at.
Josephine.
I just got this motorboat - it's an experimental model.
Do you mind riding backwards? It may take a little longer -
Would you do me a favor?
I may not be Dr. Freud or a Mayo Brother or one of those French upstairs girls - but could I take another crack at it?
Really?
That's wonderful.  Poor Josephine.
What'll it be, sir?
Sorry, sir, we only serve coffee.
Scotch coffee, Canadian coffee, sour-mash coffee...
I don't know what you're talking about.
I should get going.
Say something. Please.
Whos ever heard of dance lessons for a wedding, honestly?
Nothing.
Kat, wait. I dont want you hating me. Weve never had this talk. You know how crap I am at this.
What color are my shoes?
Six thousand, right?
How does it feel to get that much money just for being you?
That wont be an issue, believe me. I find the idea of sex for money morally repugnant.  No offense.
The real story is that my mother was a hippie. And a stripper. She was insanely inappropriate with me. She used to wash her lingerie in my bathwater. While I was still in the bath.
Its hard to explain.
When I said Id never done a wedding before, I didnt say that no one ever asked. I just never said yes.
There was something in your voice on the phone that day.
I should go.
Dad!
I am now, sir.
They lived a long time ago -- before you and I were born.
You think about your father a lot, don't you?
Well, you shouldn't worry about him too much, David.
But you did all you could, David. Not many little boys could've gone on such a journey as you did.
I can't answer that for you -- but it's no fault of your own that you don't know where your father is now. You tell me what you did that kept you from finding your father.  Come on, tell me...
And so you did your job, right?
Whewwww! You sure keep my mind jumping, boy!
Yes, sir...
What's wrong with your leg, Daddy?
Wheeew! This is some hard work, but it beats goin' to jail.
Miss Boatwright --
Who's winning, Mama?
Can't sleep?
So did I. I figured when the time got right, we could all take a day or two and walk up there, but it's not the kind of long trip for a child to take alone.
But you'll be away from home for days -- what will you do when the dark comes, where will you sleep? I can't send you away from here like that!
We brought your laundry, Miss Boatwright.
Hi ya doin' there, Ike?
Whatcha got there?
Well, let me have it.
The boy done went into my walnuts! I skin my fingers to the bone to pick two pounds that's worth almost nothing at the commissary and he done took almost half of what I pick!
Where you goin'!?
But, Nathan--
Eric! Did you just say the "F" word?
Is it Cartman's mom?
Dude, that movie was fucking sweet!
Hey Cartman.
You know, me and Stan were just talking about what a fat fucking hunk o' fat fuck you are.
Mph rmph rm!!
Mph rm rmph!!
You've got a stupid accent too.
What? Fuck French people. Fuck 'em in the ear.
Ha! Is the Pope Catholic?
WE'RE going! WE started La Resistance to save Terrance and Phillip! We're going!
Mph mph.
YOU GOTTA BE FUCKING KIDDING ME!!
No! That's not Terrance or Phillip!
OH MY GOD!! YOU KILLED KENNY!!
I'm so sick of these soldiers.
WHAT?
My fellow Americans. I have led this fight in the War against profanity. I have founded Mothers Against Canada.  Our neighbor to the north has abused us for the last time.
What about air strikes?
We have to have air strikes on their military and entertainment centers.  It's the only way to ensure that their smut can't reach American soil!
Uh, we're just, starting our program...
Hello, Conan!
AGH!
You know I do.
Now do what I say and keep your fucking mouth shut!
Wendy... How would you like to go get some ice cream?
My friend the clitoris told me.
Oh Warren...oh Warren...take me, God take me...
Oh yeah...
Anna...
Were you going to give it to them?
You're certain of that?
The bridge is fine, Taylor, how are things down there?
Much as I'd like to help you and our valued guests, I'm afraid I can't.
Well that's your call.  Doesn't make a damn bit of difference to me.  Just as long as I get my cut.
What's the use...we're gonna die...
Supposing we could get out of this room?  Is there anything we could do to reach the bridge?
Can't we access the mainframe to check the ship's condition?
I don't know what we're facing.
I guess I owe you a debt of gratitude.  You saved my life.
He's out of the equation.  Talk to me.
Hurry.  You have to get them out of there!
I'm fine.
Thank you.
No, just enjoying the view.
So I've been told.
Look.  We're talking about life and death here.  I don't know why we're even having this conversation.
But the corridor outside this door is open, correct?
Where can I find Buzz Fazeli?
Haven't seen a ball like that since '69.
Three whips. To go.
Did you know you were parked in the handicap space?
I got suspended when I was young, too. I was pretty cocky in my day.
100 years! 
What do you think I can do?
Sure, around here, any fat old bald guy could be king. I'm nothing. It wouldn't do any good for me to talk to the Congress.  Hey, you thirsty? You like orange whips?
It's the next level, the next dimension...  ...the small ball.
It's gonna be bigger than big. Think Europe. Think Asia. They don't have room for real golf courses in Japan.
If the Japanese are pansies, then pansies are my kind of people. Sheila steps over to the booth with their food. The Buzz Burger has three holes cut in the middle to make it look like a bowling ball. Buzz sees the two sleazeballs park their car and walk towards the diner.
Oh sure. Let everyone in. From now on I leave the door wide open. Let the parade begin!
It's not so bad. When I'm alone, it feels like someone else. Sheila grabs the bottle from Junior, opens it and pours some on her shish kebab. She leans over and whispers furiously to her father.
That's some pinfall. Almost a 133 average. Her ball's flat, she needs to work on her spin control.
Don't go near the bowling alley.
Do those two work for your dad or mine?
Do you talk with your mom?
My mom told me not to stay in this town.
I'm a credit card junkie. I went on a binge and my dad bailed me out. Now I'm trapped in his easy payment plan.
Yeah, but they're all little wannabes. I'm looking for a professional man.
How much would you charge me for the lips?
Come on, bargain with me.
You professional men drive a hard bargain. I'm afraid I only have five on me. Sheila pulls out a 5 dollar bill.
Why did you come back?
If Junior finds us, he'll kill us both.
You don't get two chances with Junior.
You should probably hit the road. Go home. This place could get hazardous for your health.
There's heat coming the door.
Wait a minute --
I'm not sure.  I've never seen anything like it.
Norman, please!  Don't!
See this?  Coral.  Geologists measured the coral growth on top of the craft to be over five meters thick.
Coral grows at a rate of two and a half centimeters a year --
-- dating the crash at least that old.
Maybe older --
Extraordinary, isn't it?
You can't just leave Harry down here, sir.
But sir --
Yes, sir.  I'm here.
Yes, sir.
So?  What's the problem?
Edmunds?  Get in here.  I want to know exactly how this is being transmitted.
She wired this system.
Time travel.  I always thought it was one of those myths... like Santa's reindeer.
Edmunds?
It could breathe in air and exhale cyanide gas.
Beth --
Don't do this.
You get it straightened out?
It's for motion sickness.
Ulcers.
A synthetic opium analogue.
Nothing about drowsiness.
Tranquilizer.  Causes drowsiness.
It's getting cold.
You don't think I put something in it, do you?
Beth, stop it!
Well, what's your theory?
Just in time, too.
What?
Our answer.
Harry, can you tell me about the sphere?
You remember opening the door?
Tell me about the door.  Do you remember how you opened the door to the sphere?... Harry?
It's the squid!  Stop it!
C'mon, Norman!
Gimme a second --
Her legs are in the way.
Easy Ted, we're not mining gold.
Well, if it's a discharge --
No other equipment?  Scientific instruments?
Well, how about we wait and see what Harry comes up with?
Well, we'll see...
Darth Vader is on this system.  I can feel him.  I can feel the Kiber Crystal.
I... I'm not a Bendu Officer.  I'm not even a startrooper.
You saw through me?
I assure you my intentions weren't bad.
Are you sure you don't need it?
What do I do?
You're Starkiller?
Have you been checked out?
All the data banks in Artoo are still secure.
When Artoo has been safely delivered to my forces, you get your reward. You have my guarantee.
The plans and specifications to a battle station with enough fire power to destroy an entire system... Our only hope in destroying it is to find its weakness, which we will determine from the data I stored in Artoo.
Where are you taking us now anyway?
Maybe you should just drop us off. I'm sure we can find someone willing to take the risk.
Get to the ship!
Are there medical facilities on Yavin?
Level five, Detention block A-23, cell 2187.  She's still alive...
I say we all go to the laser parlor and get cut together.
Saddle up, Roughnecks !
Ten of clubs. You still gonna sign up for Starside R&D ?
I've been thinking about applying for Federal Service, too. Fleet, maybe.
I'm eighteen. It's my decision, I think I'd make a pretty good pilot. I've good great reflexes. You need that for maneuvering, you know.
Eight point... no, uh, seven...
All I know is Carmen's going to be a citizen, and I don't think it'll work out for us if I'm not.
Johnny, this is Zander.
WHERE IS IT ?
I thought I was dead. Lucky for me you jokers showed up, eh ?
Romance is just a vestigial biological response to procreation...
Hey, Carl, what's wrong ?
What happened to your hair ?
Which way ?
Where'd it come from ?
It stinks, you goin.
If they didn't want you, they woulda kicked you out, amigo.
Good good, then it's all settled.
You'll resign, and that's all there is to it. It might look bad, but if that's the worst you suffer...
I'm telling you, you will ! You're not going back. You're going to go on vacation !
You knew the Lieutenant before the war... What was he like ?
Geez, I don't think I've ever seen him smile.
Hello... Oh, Johnny...!
What do you think you're doing ?
That would mean a comlete disregard for the mission objective. They hang you for that, Rico.
All dead except one, sir.
This is my farm. Get on the boat, NOW ! That's an order, Sergeant.
Then V'ger must withdraw its orbiting devices.
And when V'ger melds? What will happen to you?
We'll have to replace Commander Sonak. I'd still like a Vulcan there, if possible...
That's precisely the point, Captain. We don't know it will do. Moving into the cloud -- at this time, is an unwarranted gamble.
We could have cut it off at the main computer...
Negative control from inertial lag will continue 22 point five seconds before forward velocity slows to sub-light speed.
Thirty seconds to Cloud boundary...
Hold station...!
I still contain fragments of my human half.
That vessel is generating a forcefield measurably greater than the radiation of the Earth's sun.
Were you right? Spock? V'ger is a living machine...?
Spock, we <U>were</U> its answer!
... and the 'foolish' emotions which drive us?
Starfleet has been apprised of our situation, Captain.
I quit.
I quit the movie.
Actually, I'm not sure if I quit.  I think that I got fired.  I'm such a liar. I never could tell the truth.
I just got kicked off my first movie.
That's good.  That's really good.  You have a gift for words.
I don't mean to impose, but...do you think we might...
What happened?
Uh huh.
Start?  This isn't a good time.
Later on.
You, um, you, um, you going out with your fiance?
I didn't say anything special, I was just talking out loud.
No, that's true.
What is it all about?
Waal, <u>there</u> you are, and Have I Got Some News for <u>You</u>...
Well, where do they hold court?
A jacket for five dollars...I can buy this town for fifty bucks.
Yeah, but they never made a movie here.
...why am I here...?
Stay ready.  Stay by yourself in your room.
Whyn't you learn your lines?
Her...
Is Mr. Barrenger there...?
It's a mistake.  It's all over.  I'm sorry that we've inconvenienced you.
Claire, when did you...
I know, it's the hardest thing in the world, and it seems everybody wants...
...wants a piece...
And you know what...?
Where you off to?
Why?
What's in the case?
I...
I...
I'm very sorry I...
What's the...
Well, you call him, and call me back, but this is it, pal, you <u>fuck</u> with me, and I'm going to tear out your heart and piss on your lungs through the hole in your <u>chest</u>.   And the best to Marion...  Where have <u>you</u> been?
It's just a formality.
The chairs go, the Lazyboy goes...
He's going to <u>get</u> that calf.
&quot;Those who travel far and near this will make you DISAPPEAR!&quot;
It just slipped out.
What happens when he loves Rachel more than us?
Look she's upset --
I can't hear you.
Annabelle...wake up honey...
I'm sorry, okay?  Let's not fi...
You know what that creep and his frogfaced footmen are calling me <u>now</u>?  In front of the whole <u>world</u>? Frosty, the Snow Bitch!!
Here's <u>weak</u>...Mom said she was gonna talk to the <u>teacher</u> and Brad's <u>parents</u>!!  Can you <u>believe</u> the <u>humiliation</u>???
Now Ladies, the secrets to a great pie is the crust.  And the secret to a great flaky pie crust comes from less flour and more...what?
But you told us to starve.
IS THAT YOU?
I'm somewhere, thinking of you.  And meatballs.  And you know what?
Of course, you do.  Being magic. Then you know I've got a flu bug, and I turn green and barf profusely when I even think about food.  So, all the more meatballs for you.  But you know what.
Ben!  Mommy's so glad to see you -- Now stop climbing!  Ben listen to me...
Where Ben?
Ben where do you have to get to?
Cooper, back the fill off I don't have enough shadow...
You say that like I don't know that.
And when did that pass?
Which part of no don't you understand?
Our children.
But he hasn't.  He wandered off.  I know it's terrifying.  I can imagine how you felt when that call came -- But it happens.
Jackie, you've made mistakes -- We all make mistakes --
Jackie stop.  We promised we never go there.
The great thing about life is that things keep changing.
Luke was in the shower this morning and Annabelle sort of walked in without knocking.
So why did y...
Uh.  Have you told Luke and the ki...
And cigarettes.  I smoke, too.
Can I look at the pictures?
I'm thinking.  Do I know you well enough to really chew you out?
Now, 'limp dick', I know.  What. Is 'snowballing'?
Because there'll be, oh, 20 or 30 mothers phoning me in the next hour or so.  And they'll b...
She likes a Stolie, no ice.
You know, there's nothing you have to say.  Because they know your heart.  You don't have t...
It's forever you know.
She called it a fight.  <u>The</u> fight.
Out! Leave the table!
You heard me: leave the table!
When I'm in high school I'm not going to play any football. I'm just going to concentrate on class rank.  What did you do in high school?
Weren't there high schools in El Salvador?
Must've been hard being poor.
Hmmm.  But, Consuelo, even though your poor, don't you have any hobbies or interests or anything?
But like, what do you like to do when you're not working?
But when you're not. Like now. What do you like to do?
Steak's really good tonight. SCOOBY  Good.
Hi, Scooby! How was school today?
Ready for tomorrow?
But what kind of pull did you have?
I just want to know what the hell he's doing in his room that's so interesting he doesn't come down for dinner.
You have beautiful skin.
That's good.
Yeah. But not any more.
What is most important to you?
Anything else?  Maybe a sandwich?
You're a lot like my father, Cooper... you think with your heart.
Go fuck yourself...
What about Cooper--where is he?
Have you broken it yet?  We've got six more heads and that means six more hours.
Of the separate chemicals--I don't know, uh, offhand--
They must have got their hands on a test vial!
Yes?
My seven body orifices????
Go back to sleep, baby.
Under the circumstances, General, what would you think they should do?
You see, you knew the answer all the time, General.
What do you suppose is going to happen if General Ripper's planes start bombing their targets?
Suppose that were the case?
Major, those are my boys out there dying.
I believe it will be just a few minutes, at the most.
I'm not certain, Mister President.  But I believe it was four.
We should be crossing the coast in about six minutes.
Just the missiles.
Forty-five.  Still coming straight and fast. Twelve o' clock.
Between Mach 3 and 4.
Wing attack, Plan-R.  That's exactly what it says.
Listen, King, old buddy.  On behalf---
Yes, Major.
Can't "Ace" help you?
What happened?
We crossed the coast over an hour ago. Okay?
First lesson in War College:  Never under- estimate your enemy.
It would not be difficult.  Nuclear reactors could provide power almost indefinitely. Greenhouses could maintain plant life. Animals could be bred and slaughtered. A quick survey would have to be made of all the suitable minesites in the country, but I shouldn't be surprised if several hundred thousand of our people could be accomodatedd. Every nation would undoubtedly follow suit.
It's called "Burger Manifesto, Part One The Dialectical Expression of Testosterone." Isn't that a great title?
Your ability to fantasize is only exceeded by your ability to lie.
Hey, it's me. No, that's, that's the ultimate liar of liars.
No, I'm here. Where are you?
No, no, no, no, I don't wanna be stuck with the guy. I want the tickets.
You know what we should do? Go to the...
Sure. You make art and you want people to see it.
Your his publicist?
Look, look, look. You gotta go now, okay? The customers complain.
No, no, no, no, no, it's new.
What's up guys?
He says we got to be at the radio station at seven a.m. Can you handle that?
Great.  Hi. I'm Erica.
Hi, Jeff. Nice to meet you.
Oh, wow.
Two-fifty.
I ate a dog when I was in Thailand. Tasted exactly like this sparerib.
Tim, can we go? This is ridiculous.
Was that supposed to be me?
What?
What feelings?
Of course.
Come with me.
So what do you wanna do?
No one does nothing, Jeff.
New ground?
Taking one community college course on the history of Nicaragua, while barely holding a job packing boxes?
My goal is to make art.
Why should I stay here, Jeff? So we can sit on the corner and watch the lights change, while you bitch about Burnfield?
So I can spend the rest of my life guessing what it would be like to be a real artist?
So you and I can fuck while your parents are out having dinner at the Sizzler? What are we doing, Jeff? You and me?
Do your covers and all that shit.
Go.
So who are you?
Well, if we're, like, the man invisible, what are you?
Yeah, well, that's what I do too.
Comment, say things, think. Whatever. Why are you so special?
Pakistani. Okay? We're from Pakistan.
Yeah, come on, play it.
Is that Jeff?
Okay. You know what? Watch your fucking language, alright? Or I might have to.
Oh, come on, Pony. I'm just kidding. Wow, you rock stars are really sensitive, huh? You know, there's a life on the road?
Hey, your gonna regret this.
I can't believe your grandparents never come down here.
...He slices off the guy's ear, and I mean you see everything - the bloody pink hole where the --
No.
... I don't know.  Probably not.
I never knew you dreamed of working in a grocery store bank branch.  Baby, we are living the great American Dream!
"No" you're not sure or "No" I'm not fat?
Yeah?
Hello?
No.  This is Diane.  I think you have the wrong number.
Hello?
Hannah, we've...
Oh my G-d!  I'm not first!
Diane, it says here you're going to have mood swings, uncontrollable gas.
...and sex dreams where you actually have an orgasm!
Good party.
Perhaps the reason I hated Bases Loaded is that I knew your name. I'd always heard you had some talent.
Sorry, Miss Schaefer, but I've given up writing on spec.
May I say you smell real special.
That's no shampoo.  It'smore like a pile of freehly laundred hand- kerchiefs, like a brand new auto- mobile.  How old are you anyway?
Norma, I want to apologize for not calling you.
I'm pretty busy, as you can see...
Yes, I did.
What assistant?
Gordon Cole?
Are you or aren't you?
And you have written pictures, haven't you?
That's a dreadful shirt you're wearing.
Nothing, if you work in a fill- ing station.  And I'm getting rather bored with that sport jacket, and those same baggy pants.  Max, what's a good men's shop in town?  The very best... Well, go there !
What are the notes?
Norma, I can't take it.  You've bought me enough.
Keep it.
How do you like that? We've made twelve pictures together. His greatest successes.
You heard him.  I'm a star!
I'm the greatest star of them all.
Whose room was this?
Relax, fans.  The car isn't here.
I lent it to a friend of mine. He took it up to Palm Springs.
You don't believe me?  Look in the garage.
Bring something to drink.
I said stop, I didn't say run into a brick wall.
Yes! You own the Coffer of Shadow. Nothing can withstand its power.
Wait...don't leave me in here...
There's one sure way to find out how you feel.
Let me kiss you.
You're not afraid are you?
If we wait until we understand everything we'll be dead. Come on. You can learn more from one kiss than from years in school.
Hey, listen, when all this blows over, maybe we could get together every now and then and see each other. And maybe something might. happen again. What do you think?
Why not? You're a good-looking girl. And I'm--- available.
Hey! Ethan!
This is your problem, right here. This girl's driving you insane, Ethan. Let me help you.
Hey, where you going?
What about my proposal?
I had to dump the papers in a trashcan. The Danvers have been arrested!
I saw them dragged out of the Administration Building.
I can't help it if men notice me.
I'm sorry... I didn't know.
Why is he acting so strangely?
Cheer up, Nigel. It's not the end of the world.
I have plans Nigel. You could come with me... I'm going places.
Which of you is willing to make that sacrifice?
Maybe you'd like to get rid of this Supergirl yourself, Nigel?
They'll be grateful. If you hadn't found it, it would still be lost. Look, up ahead.
There is a way.
But it's impossible.
What?
Lana Lang. How great to see you.
Gee, I haven't done this in years.
Well, it's true you have to be careful things don't spoil, especially with mayonnaise or cream.
Me??
No, well in this case I think I can speak for him.  I mean, I'm pretty close to him, you know.  Superman will be there on Wednesday.
Mr. Kent, could I ask you something?
Ah yes, August Gorman. Have you looked for work this week, Mr. Gorman?
What kind?
Dishwasher? Any luck?
Mr. Gorman, according to our records you have been unemployed for 36 weeks.
Not counting this week.  You secured employment last June as a messenger and were discharged after one day for. . .
A television set?
The only other employment you found was in a fast-food joint--  -- which lasted. . . 28 minutes! Well! That's some kind of record. Talk about fast!
Mr. Gorman, the city of Metropolis is generous to a fault, but. . .
Thirty-six weeks of chronic unemployment, thirty-six weeks of living off the taxes of hard-working citizens. Do you know what you are?
You are, I was about to say, no longer eligible.
Gus, Webco, the Webster industrial complex, is a family-owned cartel. A little magnesium here, a little zinc there. Some railroads here, some farm machinery there. You follow?
Hey, boss.
Turn on the T.V.
Uh...what channel were you watching?
A waste-basket? GUS Those are plans.  Blueprints.
A computer.
Not like this one you ain't. Nobody in the world got one like this 'cause it don't exist yet. We got to build it.
I invented it, man. In my head. It's a stone killer-diller get-down get-it-on and twice-on-Sunday super mutha computer.
Everything.
Anything.
Through the telephone line terminal, that ain't nothin'.
You know, I really wasn't expecting all this.
Lots of things...
You! Activate circuits 29 through W7 and start Full Power Coordinates on Exterior Defensive Systems:
I don't know who. Whom. I can't trace it.  In the old days it was simple. We kept books, we had ledgers, we could see what was going in and what was paid out. If somebody wanted to rob you, he'd come in with a gun and say 'stick 'em up."  Now they get theses blasted computers to do their dirty work!
Small potatoes.
Chicken feed.  If Gus Gorman can push the right buttons ---
Yes! This time we got it right!
It is kinda romantic.
You've been under a lot of pressure lately -
Blood . . . my . . . blood . . .
I'll try to remember that . . .
You do?
This way Lex.
Genius!  --  Lex.
No, me, me, me. Thank you.
Don't feel bad, Mr. Luthor. It almost worked. I mean California almost threw up right in the ocean. Millions of people almost killed. If it hadn't been for that guy Superman - that overgrown boyscout...
I never did this before . . . I have to tell you.
Put down Lex Luthor !
Look, they need a machine to fly.
Don't tell me. You learned to dance at church socials.
Shouldn't you pay the cabbie?
Oh, probably just a picture request. I'll take care of it if you want, Lois.
Impossible? Why?
But what good is a vow if everything gets blown away?  What good was my letter?
No, Daddy. Our business is journalism. We can't continue to be so irresponsible . . . or else we'll just lead everyone into a disaster.
Where's Clark?
Hey! Just remember I made you.
I am an experiment? I am freako?
Superman. . .  But you're... dead!
But Mr. Luthor, sir, I already  --
Do you know where you're headed?
It isn't worth getting a heart attack over, Lois.
Couldn't we forget the plane? You could lift me in your big strong arms?
Oh.
What can I tell you? He's my leader.
What's the temperature now?
About Vesuvius. About Superman writhing in the bowels of the volcano.  Ahh, the look on his face when he saw that Kryptonite. When will I see another, y'know? Y'know?
Weak sister.  I still can't figure out why it took so long for you to catch up with us after we all ran out. Y'know?
Nothing, nothing. I just want to invite him to tea.
You got wax in your ears?
It's a ...baby.
Lois, take Kent there and introduce him around
Can you actually fly faster than the speed of sound?
Do you like pink?
Where do you hail from?
Well, gents? What did I tell you? It's a piece of cake.
It would never have worked, Luthor. You are a dreamer  --  a sick, twisted dreamer.
It wouldn't hurt. You can't go on living in fantasies. Did you really think you could get hold of a nuclear bomb? And drop it?  Why, our Strategic Defense boys would have  --
The XK 101. Luthor, that operates on radio waves. And with our fail-safe system, only the President himself can push that button.
So there were others?
Then...when did she get better?
But you said...
She's in trouble?
That's my daughter.  Or it may be the police to tell me that they've found her dead.  She's a drug addict.
I don't see how that concerns you, Billy.
Well, I don't know why it should. There's a whole lot of people in town involved with lawsuits.  We're hardly unique here, Billy.  I mean, I can understand how you feel.
Yes.
Your kids never cry.
They can look forward to that.
That's the way I thought of them sometimes.
Good morning, Wanda.  Hi, Hartley.
Maybe we shouldn't be talking about this just now, with you barely home. Aren't you hungry, honey?  Want me to fix you something?
You can only feel lucky that you didn't die for so long.  Then you start to feel...unlucky.
Do you have a room?
I'm in a car wash.
Remember that time we were having the car washed and I started playing with the automatic window?  How old was I, Daddy?  Five or six?  I got absolutely soaked, remember?
We do.
Yes.
I'm not sure if that will leave much on the plate.
Now on that morning, did there come a time, Nicole, when you left your parents' house?
What time in the morning was this?
You saw the speedometer?
Did you say anything to Mrs. Driscoll?
Why not?
There wasn't time?
You remember this?
He's a lawyer.  He's our lawyer.
Well, yes.  He's your lawyer too.
That sonofabitch owes thousands to the bank and half the businesses in town.  He's about to lose his house and car.
Come on boys, break it up...
Thanks for the publicity spread you got the boys for the benefit tomorrow.
Well, son, looks like you went out and bought yourself a packet of trouble...
Mr. Hunsecker, there's nothing to that smear.  You have my sincere word...
Not being partial, are you?
Susie, I'm sorry if---
Say, that's good - it's nice - in fact, it's APT, Harry!
Awright, that brings us up to five weeks ago. "Sidney, I got a nasty little problem here." Did I say no? I'm frank to admit - it don't jell as fast as we like... But all of a sudden I CAN'T GET YOU ON THE PHONE NO MORE!  WHY?... And why, as of this date, am I frozen out of the column...
No, lemme finish.  I DON'T LIKE THIS JOB!  That boy is dumb only on matinee days - otherwise he's got a head.  And Susan, like you said, she's growing up.  Two heads. What I mean, we got a slippery, dangerous problem here!
Correct me if I'm wrong - WE! Because when I'm out on this very slippery limb for you, you have to know what's involved.
Full of beans, ain't you?  But you know that you'll stand or fall by what you're doing now...
I know...I know you're the strongest cop in town.
Don't you ever get messages, Eyelashes?  I called you twice.
I don't think so.
Don't you think I have any feelings? What am I?  A bowl of fruit?  A tangerine that peels in a minute?
If that's for me, tear it up!
Frank, you don't listen!  J.J. just told you to shut your mouth!
It's given me a big lift to know that some people want me for myself, not just because I'm my brother's sister.
Listen, when your band was playing at Roseland -
Steve, I...
They told us not to ask where they got it.  I thought... Japan... hell, I don't know.  I didn't want to know.
I'm right here.  I'm fine.  What's the dog's name?
Now remember, you're not gonna kill anyone, right?
Not even of dying?
You don't feel any emotion about it one way or the other?
Will it melt in there?
It's okay.  It'll by okay.  We'll figure it out.
You said I could be transferred to the minimum security wing and have visitors if I showed improvement in six months.  Well, it's been six months, and I was looking forward to seeing my son.
The man most directly responsible is Miles Bennet Dyson, Director of Special Projects at Cyberdyne Systems Corporation.
In a few months he creates a revolutionary type of mircoprocessor.
Where do you stand on all this?
On Furtwngler.
You think a whole orchestra, what, a hundred and forty or so guys, could be orchestrated?
So, what does the Russki want?
Can I ask you a favour, Major?
When you question him again, could you treat him with more respect?
Major, he may just be the greatest conductor of this century and that merits respect.
Yes, I'm a Jew. But I like to think first I'm a human being.
Major, show me someone who hasn't made an anti-Semitic remark and I'll show you the gates of paradise.
Think you can get me any of that?
Mine's the Eleventh.
I'm kidding, Emmi. What about a record player? You have that, too?
What's in those files?
Or maybe you called Goebbels or Goering? You were so close you were in the same shithouse as them.
Sure.
Your guess is as good as mine.
Tough, tough!
I don't know, he wasn't my case. Why did you escape to Switzerland just before the war ended?
Why were they going to arrest you?
Come on, admit it. K worried you, didn't he? He always worried you. In 1942, he's thirty-four years old, you're already fifty-six. And Goebbels and Goering keep saying to you, 'If you don't do it, little K will.' Never mind art and politics and symbols and airy-fairy bullshit about liberty, humanity and justice because I don't care how great you are. It's the oldest story in the book,  The ageing Romeo jealous of the young buck. The real reason you didn't leave the country when you knew you should have was that you were frightened that, once you were out of the way, you'd be supplanted by the Miracle Kid, the Party's boy twice over, flashy, talented little K.
Well, I'm just beginning to develop my theme. Isn't that what you call it in classical music, developing your theme? Okay, so they played on your insecurity. That's human, understandable. But, there is one guy who doesn't like little K as much as he likes you - yeah, the number one man your old pal, Adolf. He thinks you're the greatest, and when he says, I want Wilhelm for my birthday, boy, they better go out get Wilhelm. So, Josef calls and threatens you with little K. And you said to hell with the Ninth in Vienna, I'll give it to Adolf as a birthday present in Berlin. That's the trick they played, they got you by the balls and they squeezed. Hard. Why did you stay? Why did you play for them? Why were you the flag-carrier for their regime?  Jealousy?
Is it true you're going to interview Dr. Furtwngler today?
I can give you freedom of movement, freedom to work, freedom, Helmuth. But I need something in return.
So, you never heard of him.
Do you know who Arturo Toscanini is?
He's as big as Toscanini, maybe even bigger. In this neck of the woods, he's probably Bob Hope and Betty Grable rolled into one.
Anything else?
I haven't seen you in here lately, Mr. Miller.
You must have a girlfriend.
You cold?
Bag some Z's?
Make sure there's none on the threads, like this.  Now screw the end-cap on...very gently.
What are you doing?
Sarah.  Sarah, this is Dr. Silber- man.  I'd like you to tell him everything Reese said to you.  Do you feel up to it?
That Silberman just crack me up.  He had this guy in here last week who set his Afghan on fire. Screwed it first, then set it on--
I apologize, sir, I'm having a bad day...
You've got to be kidding.
This is C.R.S.
A fresh shirt...
They're watching.
It's just money.  You should be glad you're alive.
All I mean is... someone like you...
What?
I don't know.  A lot.
What the fuck are you... ?
It's mine...
Guess you missed it.
You look good.
About me?
Never better.
Divorced.  Remarried to some pediatrician or gynecologist, or pediatric gynaecologist, in Sausalito.
I redecorated.  What about you?
Connie... what brings you here?  Is everything alright?
You need anything?
Really?
No!  You're one of them.  Of course, it makes perfect sense!
You're behind this, aren't you?  You and your sick friends.  Well, make it stop!
Because you hate me.  Because you had to be here, when mom died.  Because you had to do it alone.  Well, don't you think if I'd known... I'd've been here too.  I'd have been here...
I'm sorry, Christ, I'm sorry!  How many more times do I have to say I'm sorry before you forgive me... ?
It's just a t.v.  He's just an actor.
Get rid of them.
Isn't this what you like?  They told me you had a thing for boats.
Your mother thought he was a good man.  He worked very hard.  What I remember most was his manner was so... slight.  It was easy to spend time in a room, and not realize he'd been there the whole time.
No.  What happened... no one expected it.
Not much, I think.
You're not like him at all.  I don't know exactly what's going on around here lately, but don't make me start worrying about you.
Look... what I'm doing is none of your business...
Very well.  If you tell me not to worry, I shan't.
Couldn't get the last ones.  You?
Is that the question of compassion or science?
You used the wrong test.
All the carvings.
Nell... please, Nell... take a deep breath...
Yes, this is Doctor Marrow.
Is she asleep?
It's make the soup or answer the door.  Can't do both.
You've been out of the world for a long time, haven't you?
Well, it wasn't me.  Mister Dudley had to clean it and he knows that he's in charge of all the messes so why would he make more work for himself and...  You said the Good Doctor was with you.
This is real, I'm not making it up!  Theo, you saw it!  You were there -- the banging and last night.  You, you all saw the painting!
I've lived in L.A. all my life, I've never done this drive.
Where do <u>you</u> think he is, Mike.
No.  I mean.  Not even your people should be involved.  Right?  It's too close now.
You think I'm staying?
I never said nothin' about nothin' like that.  No, no, no.  That's not what I wrote to you.
You're kiddin' me, right?
These are not guys you can just go run a number on, man.
Valets.  What d'ya mean valets.  What is he, then, the Earl of fucking Doncaster?
... Reminds me of Jennifer.
You weren't disappointed in her, then.
She was twenty-one when she came to me.  ... Straight from leaving you.
How did you come to have my address? Found it, did you.  Among her things.
Where's Big Sur?
How far?
Fancy it?
Never thought of that.  Busman's holiday.
That's where Valentine's scarpered.
Out on a oil rig.  In the North Sea. Nine years.
Well, time off for good behavior, you know.  I shouldn't have even been there -- it was these other blokes who shoulda gone in my place.  I got lumbered with the job they were responsible for.  I don't mind pulling me own cart, but not someone else's, know what I mean.
I had to, didn't I.  Nothing else for it. Then just when I'd finished my nine years -- my contract -- wallop, I had to bugger off to the States.
So why would he want to see you.
Pleasure.
EMI in London.  I work with Ian.
You must know Ian.
Great bloke.  Really turned things around there.  180 degrees.
Hello, Rachel.
...I guess I've been all wet.
...Ed Crane. Remember? Today?
I'm, uh, I'm--the barber.
Well, there it is. Writ large in legal escriture, next step is--
Your place?
...What a knucklehead.
Dave.
...Doris--
...I gotta hand it to him, he tossed a lot of sand in their eyes. He talked about how I'd lost my place in the universe...
...how I was too ordinary to be the criminal mastermind the D.A. made me out to be, how there was some greater scheme at work that the state had yet to unravel, and he threw in some of the old truth stuff he hadn't had a chance to trot out for Doris...
...Did you make that up?
This is what family is for, Ed! This is when ya come together!
Close ranks! Goddamnit! Those sons of bitches!
I don't care what it costs! This is when ya come together!
Hello!
Uh, Vince.  Sorry.  This won't wait.
There are a couple of kids who were lost yesterday near the site of the murder.  Claimed they saw a monster. They're pretty determined to tell you their story.  You want to see them?
If the party goes forward, and that's a big if... I've arranged for a large police presence.
Yes.
D'Agosta?  Ippolito.  Come in.
I made it outside.  I'll co-ordinate the rescue efforts from here.  Help is on the way.  Just sit tight.
What happened to them?
Did you hear that?  My God.  He says that Mbwun is real!
Dear God.  Where are we, Lieutenant?
What is it?
Whatever it is, it must be common on the tepui.  John used it as packing material.
I'm coming with you.
Margo, this is too dangerous.  You always think you can solve everything.  This time you don't have enough information.  The animal might behave in unexpected ways.  Leave her here with me.  Don't put her in danger.
It had a long tongue, teeth this big and yellow eyes.
They were yellow!
Oh no.  I smell it.
4-monoxytocin is... "A hormone secreted by the human hypothalamus gland."
What happened?
I heard you calling and I ran after you, but you kept disappearing and I couldn't keep up.
That was D'Agosta.
No!  Don't kill him!  Pendergast, you were right.  It's John!
We've declared a curfew.  Everyone else is at first positions.
Are we talking Emmies?
Of course, Truman has always been very much in on casting.
What's he doing?
The memory of who?
See here, this is us.  All the way round here, Fiji.  You can't get any further away before you start coming back.  Y'know, there are still islands in Fiji where no human has ever set foot.
It's not that simple.  Takes money, planning.  You can't just up and go.  Oh, I'm going to do it, don't worry about that.  I've just got to move slow.  Pick my moment.  Bonus time's just around the corner.  Soon as I finish the...
What's that?
Come on, Truman.  Haven't you studied enough?
Truman, I took the "hypocrite" oath!
You know surprises aren't good for me. You should really call before you come over, dear.
Not supposed to talk about it.
You've been back to Dallas?
Are you going to let us in on what exactly you're trying to prove --
-- those are very serious allegations, Agent Scully --
Who called this meeting?
How's that?
I was right about Dallas. Wasn't I, Agent Mulder?
I picked up the historical document of the venality and hypocrisy of the American government. The daily newspaper.
According to the newspaper, FEMA had been called out to manage an outbreak of the Hanta virus. Are you familiar with the Hanta virus, Agent Mulder?
And are you familiar with FEMA? What the Federal Emergency Management Agency's real power is? FEMA allows the White House to suspend constitutional government upon declaration of a national emergency. To create a non-elected government. Think about that.  What is an agency with such broad sweeping power doing managing a small viral outbreak in suburban Texas?
I know you're bored in this assignment, but unconventional thinking is only going to get you into trouble now.
You've got to quit looking for what isn't there. They've closed the X-Files. There's procedure to be followed here. Protocol.
Something's not right...
Why are you whispering?
What did you find?
What kind of infection?
Scully -- listen to me. I'm going home, then I'm booking a flight to Dallas. I'm getting you a ticket, too.
I need you there with me. I need your expertise on this. The bomb we found was meant to destroy those bodies and whatever they were infected by.
-- I'll have you back for it, Scully. Maybe with evidence that could blow that meeting away.
What?
We're not chasing trucks, we're chasing evidence --
That bomb in Dallas was allowed to go off, to hide something: bodies infected with a virus you detected yourself.
Yeah, well they may this one.
This virus -- it... 
It may be extraterrestrial.
Been where?
Why was I assigned to you? To debunk your work. To reign you in. To shut you down.
Why don't you go on ahead head and I'll confirm authorization.
What is it?
You're lying.
A virus?
This is what you've been conspiring to conceal? A disease?
We're going to tell them what we've found. What we've learned. Turn over a body infected with the gestating organism.
Let me remind you who is the new race. And who is the old.  What could be gained by withholding anything from them; By pretending to ignorance? Our knowledge may forestall their plans to step up the timetable. To start Colonization early.
He creates the obstacles, he decides which games to play.
It could take years for me to get past the barriers he's created.
I do it all the time!
I'd be there for him.
Damn him.
Absolutely.  I suppose everyone does.
Where the hell are we?
You liked him?
I hate to admit it, but there's something perversely satisfying about this.
I have to ask you some things... Are you taking any prescription drugs?
Any psychiatric medication?
What about narcotics?
I know your partner's here, but it's very important that you're honest.
Here he is.
Den leuten.
He said he remembered me too. Seems to show he wasn't in much pain.
Dr. Winkel? Who is he?
His own doctor?
Who are you looking for now?
Oh, that was many years ago.
...you know.
What is going to happen? Where is Harry?
How do you know?
Must you take those letters? CALLOWAY Yes, I'm afraid so.
That's the reason.
They'll be returned to you, Miss Schmidt, as soon as they've been examined.
I said another man was buried in his place.
That's what we want to find out.
Miss Schmidt, we know he is somewhere across the canal in the Russian sector... You may as well help us. In a few minutes Colonel Brodsky will be questioning you about your papers. Tell me where Lime is.
Please keep this passport to yourself, until I make some inquiries, will you, Major?
...to him.
Get the next plane.
Death is at the bottom of everything, Martins. Leave death to the professionals.
...in the morning.
Wait a minute - let me out.
...his number.
Oh, Mr. Martins, good evening.
Listen, Harry - I didn't believe that...
Have you ever seen any of your victims?
Not necessarily. She'd probably want to help.
Could he have been at all conscious?
Happened...Yes happened right down there.
Not saw, heard...heard. I heard the brakes. Wham! And I got to the window and saw them carry the body to the other side of the er...er Joseph...that's Joseph Emperor Joseph Statue.
Harry...
Should I make it all fact?
What are you doing in Thailand? Tourist?
You go to Patpong? See smoke from pussy, ping pong ball from pussy, razor blade from pussy; bird from pussy.
Why not? Thai girls best in the world. Thai food best in the world. Thai dope best in the world.
Richard - I saw a fin!
Hi.
But, Danny, if HaShem is everything, and we are nothing how are we to judge His actions?
What do you think you're doing?
Yeah, but not on the letters.
I bet. He didn't realize that nobody who talks such a good game ever plays one.
Put something on. You're not supposed to be naked in front of it.
They think it's the word of God, and it's holy, and the flesh isn't....
Come on, we can be like Eichmann. He studied Torah. He hated Jews.
I don't know. I just want to try it.
No. What are you looking for?
He commands it whether He exists or not...  Look, we can fight him and be crushed. Or we can submit.
An investment banking house.
Is it okay if I record this?
I'm trying to figure out where the radical right is going to next....I thought you were the most interesting person at that meeting.
Curtis is a politician -- and a bit of a hustler. He's not a thinker.
The other night you said the modern world is a Jewish disease. Could you elaborate on that?
It helps me concentrate.... So does that mean you're a white supremacist?
My mother's family is French, my father's was German, originally.
You know the joke: a Jew's shipwrecked on a desert island. When they rescue him, they see he's built two synagogues. They say, for vhat do you need two synagogues? He says, vun to pray in, and vun I'd never set foot in so long as I live, so help me God.  You pray in the one you'd never set foot in...and vice versa.
Hello...?
What is happening?
Beth Shalom? What are you talking about? Who is this...?
That was unbelievable what you did to Lucas. The guy's an animal.
Get out of here....
Not too fast.
They don't. I checked twenty times.... Somebody must have talked.
Mrs. Moebius.
The Manzetti thing must have scared her. She thinks she'll get implicated.
Who'd you kill?
Who's this?
Leary?
Do you think I...
You're leaving?
I wish, but it's full.  They recommended a pension in town. They say that all of Taormina is full.  What's going on here?
And the lights!  Running lights, stealing stretchers...!  You'll have us in jail.
How did it happen?
Is he here?
... So, after all these years, you must have lots of questions to ask.  Am I right?
Why?
Can I come in?
... Push me back in the water...
Yes... Maybe... I don't know.  I don't like competitions... It ruins the fun.  Don't you think?
Jacques, you set a world record.
And you?
You'll try again tomorrow?
This is the hotel San Domenico?
Yes, but... So, you haven't got a room left?
I changed the lock you son of a bitch!
Who... Who is that?
I guess I could be chalant about it, but then again I'm not even sure if that's a word. Listen Chief, we could stand around arguing all day, but I gotta case to crack.
Hanukkah, Shmanukkah. It isn't even one of the high holidays. What concerns me more is that my boychick is almost thirty, and has yet to settle down with a nice Jewish girl.  I'll make you a deal. I'll help you with your little Hanukkah problem if you help me with my Mordechai.
Want to get a drink?
We do!
...and the opportunity to help my brothers and sisters in the Jewish community.
Actually, I...I don't. What does that mean?
Listen cat, I'll have you know that I hate the taste of watermelon and am a terrible basketball player.
So, what's our first plan of attack Santa?
What day is it?
Here is something that should interest Charlie - a stone leopard head made by his ancestors some six hundred years ago. They used it in ceremonies. The jaguar -- in fact all the cat family -- were considered the personification of force and violence in their religious rites.
I'm sick.
Something black - something on its way to you 
Oh, dear -- I don't know what I'm going to do without you - honestly, I don't 
Charlie and I were talking. That's one reason I wanted to see you.
Tormented -- ? Why?
Then you found the leopard --
I haven't done any posse work since last time I rode with Toni Mix at the old Bijou Theatre -- aged six, If you're interested,
Get it out of here!
Makes no difference. Get him out!
That's easy. Me.
On his back, I suppose.
You're too good to me.
No - not yet.
Get it out of here!
Makes no difference.  Get him out.
That's easy. Me.
On his back, I suppose.
You're too good to me.
This is l939. Can't you subtract?
No  not yet.
Clo-Clo?
I can use them.
You already know the answer to that. I want this town to be safe and happy again --
By the way, Laurence, were you here last time your mistresss brother came over? You know, just before he disappeared?
You wouldnt recall if the brothers-in-law left together, would you?
Laurence!
Mr Lombard. Mrs De Moraes...
I doubt Friedman ever even met Leon, Deborah. Friedman dealt with select customers. As for my envelope, had he know where it was he wouldnt have mistaken me for a hitman called Lamont when we met in Los Angeles.
Directory enquiries. Can I help you?
Where were you staying before the attempt on your life and why cant you go back there?
By your Austrian?
What am I to do with the packages if...
Nothing sticks to slime, Emily.  This should cover what you lent me.
Youre not playing with little boys now, scumbag. Where is the Austrian?
Have you heard of a French film called La Collectionoose?
La collectionoose. Its about a young girl in the south of France who seduces a different man every night and then meets one who resists her. Its on TV tonight and as Im in I thought we could perhaps look at your accounts and... The review says its about the conflict between intellect and instinct. And witty. The directors supposed to be famous. Rommel or something. French. You must know him?
I dont know. How many famous French film directors can there be?
So you havent seen the film, then?
Oh... We split up.
Whatever, you come recommended. We...
Must I speak to you in French?
You may not. And besides, it is irrelevant.
Good. Now, as I trust you may have guessed, we are looking for someone to work for us. Someone whose discretion can be relied upon. Someone who while in our employ would give us full commitment. Do you think you could be that person, Mr Lombard?
Vous tes Franais?
Is this Friedman?
Is this Friedman, Martin?  Come on, scumbag. Youve reached your sell- by date. Tell me if this is Friedman, where he is in Los Angeles and what name hes using?
You seem very sure about that.
What is?
This is private property. The public footpath is back to the left of the bridge.
He showed me a book with a picture of a couple caught kissing in a street...
Fine...
Alors?
Le montage, lemballage. Not your regular street muck, is it? This is collectors stuff. How much would it cost me?
But maybe you know someone who does. An Austrian, in London, dealing in kids and snuff videos. How many can there be? These people supply to order. He has to be known, reachable.
Ha ha... Yes. With prices reaching an all time low, the name of the game has become have-it- where-its-at... As we all know, transportation has always been the costliest and trickiest part of this business...
Costliest!
What do you think?
Very funny. Can I go on now?
Listen, please accept my apologies for... you know, me pretending to be the... well it wasn't really my idea... well, yes it was my idea but...
Not so... easily.  Why aren't you... fighting...?  go on... we're almost there...
That's not what I asked... Why do you want to marry me?
Jeanne's alive!
We have to press home the attack!
But I promised Jeanne we'd fight on!
But that was her order!
Arrest them!
Really?
Jeanne, you are not helping yourself.  If you don't answer our questions properly, your refusal will be taken into account.
I assure you they do.  So... answer me... when was the last time you heard this voice?
When exactly?  A day, a week -- when?
I ask only one thing... to hear me in confession...
I don't need lodgings if we're to be marching on Orleans...
When you saw your king for the first time, was there an angel over his head?
Then why did your king believe in you without any proof?
Dunois... was it you who ordered the attack?  Answer me?!
I do love her when her fire gets well and truly stoked!
Right behind us -- Dunois with another then thousand men!
What happened?  Who gave the order to attack?
When you were taken prisoner at Compiegne, did you have a horse?
Who gave you that horse?
How many did he give you?
As much as for a Lord?  What an honor!  Did your king give you other wealth apart from horses?
What about all those dresses you were given... silk dresses weren't they?
Still, pretty wealthy for a peasant girl wouldn't you say?
My... visions...
Yes... that's what I pray for...!
No, no -- you can't stay or they won't come!
There's nothing for me to do here anymore... I don't belong here I want to be with Him now...
He says... he says I must be good... and help everyone... and take care of myself.  Do you think he's coming from the sky?
I nagged Jurek for weeks and weeks. And at last he gave in and said, 'All right, come with me tomorrow,' and so I came and they bombed the station.
Really?
What did I tell you?
What's happened?
Calm down, what, what is it?
Mama, that was a great dinner.
Very appropriate.
If I play like an angel, why don't you listen?
You don't remember me, Mr. Szpilman?
Warsaw Radio. I was a technician. I saw you almost every day.
Watch your feet!
How are the lessons going? ADA nods enthusiastically. He's getting on all right? ADA nods again Good.
I worry for you.
I don't think you should have given up the piano. I will make sure you are properly taught, with music written on to sheets and...
You don't want to learn.
And what does this do to our bargain? I cannot afford the piano if you mean me to pay.
Well, I doubt I want it very much myself.
What?
He's given it to us.
The wallet.  You gotta go after him. He's got all the money.
...It's the only reason I ain't quit before now.
I'm gettin' too slow for this racket.  I done the best I'm gonna do.  You hang on too long, you start embarrassin' yourself.
It's nothin' compared to what you could be makin' on the Big Con. You're wastin' your time workin' street marks.
Aw hell, you sound like some goddamn sucker.  You know everything I know.  You got nothin' more to learn from me.
I thought you blew all your money.
We bought ya a tap into Moe Anenberg's wire.  He's got eyes at every track in the country.  You'll get race results, odds, scratches, pole positions, everything; and just as fast as Western Union gets 'em.
You just worry about your end, kid.
What's the matter, kid?  You're not sayin' much.
What's the problem?
See and raise 1,000.
Then I'm afraid we'll have to impound your money until we're sure that it's all good.  Can I see your wallet and your ticket, please?
It'll only take 20 minutes or so. You can pick it up at the window down the hall.
You sure it'll be one of these two?
Why me?  Shaw probably has lotsa enemies to choose from.
I'm a banker, friend.  That's legit in this state.
A week's a long time, friend. Anything can happen.  All of it bad.
Take it easy.  Everything's all right.  I put it on Syphon, on the nose.
I didn't know you invented that Smelting Process.
How are you?
Mother ....  you couldn't do that. You couldn't go to her.
Did it ever occur to you that Chris might work?
Not that scrawny little....? 
How did you ever remember me?
Dead?
Shrapnel!
This gun yours?
Who's is it?
I guess that cinches it, eh, Mr. Charles?  He killed them both - Julia Wolf and Nunheim.
There are a few things we want to check up on.
You say you were in the room with the body from the time you discovered it 'til we came?
Did you see anything in Miss Wolfe's hand?
Are you sure you didn't leave the room...  that one of the bellhops or maids might not have been in there alone?
Have a shot?
Who's that man?
I thought you'd given up that sort of friend.
I don't like him.
No.  I just came back for a second. I wanted to get those bonds.
The government bonds.  The ones you took from the office safe.
I'd never tell you to sell those. I bought them for my daughter.
Now see here, Julia.  You're counting a little too much on my being absent-minded.  You've been taking a little here and there for some time, and I haven't said anything about it.  But this is fifty thousand dollars!
No one else had the combination of that safe.  You took them.  What did you do with them?
That's my business.
Thanks, and goodbye.
Settle it yourself.  What have I got a lawyer for?
I have no right to answer that.
Because I don't believe that Clyde's dead!  Why, you said yourself you saw him last night.
Pretty girl.
You got types?
Who is she?
By the way, how is your father's side?
How many drinks have you had?
Nick!  Nick!  Are you asleep?
Good. I want to talk to you.
Don't you think you'd like to go back to detecting once in a while, just for the fun of it?
No.
No thanks.
You're a fine watch dog.
On it!  I'm in it ... They think I did it!
This may be a little rough - you'd better let us go alone.
You're going to drive me crazy!
Where are you going?
Home?
Who fired you?
A casual one.
Maybe we are crazy for doing this.  But if we do it, we do it right.  I just needed to explain that in a way I wouldn't have to do it again.
He's not so--
The US Army:  Always an adventure.
It'll be too dark to make our way back now.  Let's bed down for the night and head out at first light.
What about it?
We started this together, and we're staying together, so there's no point in splitting things up now.
We can't just leave him.  He'll run back to his outfit, report our position...
That's what he says.  He could be a spy, or something.
Thanks for taking care of this for me.
Oh, man, you're not going to fall for that.
Yeah, the deed to the Brooklyn bridge.
It's going to be cool, Wes.  It's all all right.
Steady it out!
What?
You're going to blow yourselves up.
You don't know that.  It could be a trick.
X marks the spot.
But the white dot in the middle; that's got to mean something.
It's not like I figured.  It's cold.  And it's heavier than I imagined.
No.
I pick that way.
Can't you--
Which way do we go!?
That shouldn't be too hard to read.  Iraq is the pink thing.
He says it's a box.
It's a puzzle box.  If you can figure out how to open it there's supposed to be a treasure inside.
You're not saying what I think you're saying.  I can't believe you're even thinking it.
You don't know where the Iraqis have moved to.  And our forces haven't even engaged the Republican Guard yet, we don't know--
It's not a hundred miles.  It's a hundred miles through three different kinds of terrain:  Pure desert, mountains, a river.  If the map is even real.
I thought we were dead.
Is there anything you do know?
Says he's one of the soldiers that was in the helicopter.
HUMMMM.....
I haven't done anything.
What are you doing?
But we need a creative dissent. Our voices are not joined in any harmonious chorus, but the differences are differences of emphasis, not of fundamentals. Now, the new alignment's greatest need is to communicate with all its elements, rather than march along in parallel line that never converge.  Tomorrow as we focus the new movement more clearly, we will gain a new unity.
I can't see him at all.  He's been destroyed.
I'm leaving.
Right now.
I knew him.
....I'm taking SP5, but it doesn't seem strong enough.  I have a hard time concentrating.  Please forgive me, I slipped on....
High-grade det cord. This girl, either she's got strange taste in jewelry or she's into serious demolition.
The place has already be combed. Forensics pulled over a hundred sets of prints inside.
Pittsburgh, two years ago. Partner died, no back-up, I was too gung-ho. As usual.
I know. I was working a drug ring, deep cover. Played the part too well. When they pulled me out, I wasn't a cop anymore. My fiance had dumped me. Next thing I knew, I was out here on the street, doped up, auditioning for the morgue when this tough old vice cop found me, cleaned me up, gave me a second chance. He promised Captain Winters he'd look out for me.
Keep talking.
Political.
Lane oil...
Why are we stopping here?
Prints?
What about the ballistics report?
Vice... Jesus.
We're vice, I didn't see no pimps or hookers in that van. But if you're so gung-ho, we'd best call it in for some back-up.
Got it! Ace Match Company, Flint, Michigan.
What's this?
You know after a shooting I would normally take your badge and weapon, but Glass called in already and confirmed it was clean.
M'sieu Giron is downstairs.
What did you talk about?
<u>Tonsili!</u>
You're not safe anywhere nowadays.
You can trust me.
Don't stop. Keep right on complaining. It's beautiful.
Thank you!
Disappointed?
<u>This</u> <u>woman</u> <u>has</u> <u>more</u> <u>than</u> <u>jewelry</u>.
Did you ever take a good look at her--uh--
They're all right, aren't they?
Gaston. Let's open it--right now! Let's get away from here!  I don't like this place!
Goodbye, M'sieu La-- Oh, yes ... This is a rather delicate matter and I don't want to ... You see, if you read my advertisement carefully, you must have noticed that there was ...
Yes.
But incidentally, let me tell you, <u>I</u> don't like <u>you</u>. I don't like you at all!  I wouldn't hesitate one instant to ruin <u>your</u> reputation--like that! 
Yes, I would!
Like that!
And you're going to fall for them.
Any minute I want!
But attractive--
Oh, M'sieu Laval ...
Has Mademoiselle Gautier gone?
Oh, that's too bad. You see, I wanted her to do something.  Well, I guess I'll have to do it myself.
I think you'd better go.
I beg your pardon!
Mademoiselle Gautier--or whatever your name is--I thank you for your advice, but I must ask you to go. You've got your money--
Won't you even make a try for it, Mr. Andrews?
What?
Your daughter is much too hard to impress, Ruth.  Mind your step.
It was once worn by Louis the Sixteenth. They call it Le Coeur de la Mer, the --
This should be amusing.
The boats are all going.
Take my hand. I'll pull you back in.
No you won't.
So you feel like you're stuck on a train you can't get off 'cause you're marryin' this fella.
So don't marry him.
It is that simple.
Jack, must you go?
I believe you are blushing, Mr. Big Artiste. I can't imagine Monsieur Monet blushing.
That guy Lovejoy put it in my pocket.
I don't think I've ever seen such a flat calm, in 24 years at sea.
It's make the bergs harder to see, with no breaking water at the base.
Yes sir.
I can still feel its weight. If you could have felt it, not just seen it...
Anya, I think you're crazy.
Thanks. I'll be there. About seven-thirty?
You'll excuse me. 
You're coming back--
This is great. I'll be able to watch your act every night.
Oh, yes, I am, because <U>afterwards</U>--up here in the moonlight.
Aw--give a feller a break. My cards are on the table-- I want to know you. How about dining with me tonight?
Don't kid me. I'm in no mood for it.
Will you take some advice?  If you're looking for romance--count me out--  --if you know what's good for you.
--I know what I'm talking about. I'm no high-school girl looking through a window--reaching for the moon.  Guess I'll be going.
Let's forget it--can't you see I kind of like you, too ... and I don't want to get involved.
Don't let's talk about it.
Not here--follow me around the shed.
Oh, putting on the swell, eh?
If I was smart I wouldn't be working my way over on this ship. 
We coulda got two third-class!
Oh, I'm not squawkin', but I'm not used to working and it's a bad habit to get into.
A dollar seventy and I'm gonna keep it!
Shortie!--you know my motto?
Right!--but it doesn't have to apply to you--Keep your eyes open for anybody wearing a lot of cracked ice and give me the office.
Hello, Jimmy. What's up?
Why--I--er thought with all this heat turned on I'd hide it.
On the drunk.
Care to join us?
Don't get yourself all worked up--
Here you are, sir. 
Hello, Denby!
Oh, was that me you put to bed? Thanks. I've been looking all over for you.
Not yet.  Say, where is this boat headed for?
Hello, Inspector--I hear your vacation's been spoiled. Somebody lost a bracelet.
I understand you searched Brett for it last night. By the way--what do you know about him?
Oh, nothing--only I wondered why you suspected him.
Maybe he just travels in bad company.
Yep--everybody's having a good time but me--What do you want, Mary?
But, Mary--everybody's having such a great time-- why spoil it?
Well, let's hear the poem--
Very good, Mary--
What's the matter, Mary?
H'mm--<U>Dear</U> Atlantic--
That's him! That's the sucker!!
I know he is. You change those clothes and then come to my cabin. I'll expect you around twelve o'clock.
Well, I'll be a son of a sea cook!
Skinny lunger, your guns don't Impress me.  Wasn't for those guns You'd be nothin'.
He said to turn loose of him.
Feel bad about ol' Fred.  Just Can't hold back when I'm feelin' Woolly.  Still, feel kinda bad. But now we're square.  Anyway no Use for holdin' a grudge.  I Deserved a rap in the head.
Fair enough.  You know I got to Admit, you got a lot of bark on You comin' up here like this.
Ain't our way.  We go all on one, One on all.  Fight one of us, you Fight us all.  That's the Cowboy way.
Oh, we ride for a brand all right.  This brand.  How 'bout you?
Why Johnny Ringo, you look like Somebody just walked over your grave.  Oh, I wasn't quite as sick as I Made out.
I beg to differ.  We started a Fight we never got to finish. Play for blood, remember?
Since when is faro a business?
I said poker's an honest trade. Only suckers buck the tiger.  The Odds are all with the house.
It appears he missed an excellent Chance to keep his mouth shut.
You really look awful.
Then why in hell're you doin' This?  You ought to be in bed.
Hell, I got lot's of friends.
Wyatt, I... I ain't got the words.
What is it?
Oh...  Now she's starting.  How do they know?
I have to go.
That the bottle Lou gave you? Better go easy on that stuff.
Out ridin'.  So... how you doin'?

Allie-girl...And Louisa!  You're So lovely.  I'm at your feet, Darlin'.  Just at your feet.  Guess it's only right.  Ma always Said you were the prettiest.
Billy Clanton, Wes Fuller, and Billy Claiborne.  Now there's six Of 'em.  This is like a bad dream.
But -
Mr. Bond! Nice to see you.
I'm sure they will.
Actually, I've never known you to do either... But -
Don't you even miss me? Didn't I mean anything to you?
Okay, Saunders. What is it this time? Rocket in the leg? Machine pistol in the arm?
I think I've just seen my next future ex-wife.
Married?
... Kids?
No.
And what do you call this?
Down?
Thank you Colonel Everhart.  007, I'd like to see you in my office. Why don't you and the Colonel exchange numbers if you need more information?
Sorry I'm late -
You won't get away with this!
How sweet.
- Built to withstand a nuclear blast.  Are they alive?
Soviet SB-9 nuclear torpedo. Yield, one kiloton.
I'm leaving and don't even call me when the shoe falls 'cause all he did for me was to try and run my life. I'm tired of people saying Babe Brother this, Babe Brother that. What's my name?
Who is it?
I don't want to wear out welcome, but you can stay in someone's heart longer than you can stay in their house. Come with us, boy. We are going to have a good time.
I'm worn out.
I have to feed the chickens before they wake everybody up.
Man, act like this is your home.
Those days you could always find something redeeming about even the worst person.
I was afraid to go to Marcus Bottom because of him.
As God is my witness, I have never done anything to that woman.
Since she has repented, all she does is throw stones.
I don't make no bones about where I'm going to spend eternity. I have always been wild and you know that. If you are made to feel half a man, what do you think the other half is?
You invited me.
You know the saying, "your heart is in your left hand."
I was quoting from the Bible. If the shoe fits, wear it.
You know Okra asked me to marry him the other evening.
I asked Harry about it. He didn't own up to it. He said he didn't know what got into Okra.
I can't accuse him just dry long 80.
What must I do?
Come on down, guys.  It's time for games!  We've got prizes!
I looked everywhere, honey, but all I could find was your hat.
Say, isn't that mistletoe?
Don't even think about it, cowboy!
Now you're sure this spacefreighter will return to its port of origin once it jettisons its food supply?
They're gonna eat us, Buzz!!  Do something!  Quick!
Oh, come on, Buzz.  I...Buzz, I can't do this without you.  I need your help.
Why, sure you can, Buzz.  You can get me out of here and then I'll get that rocket off you, and we'll make a break for Andy's house.
Oh, Buzz, you've had a big fall. You must not be thinking clearly.
Whoa, hey -- wait a minute.  Being a toy is a lot better than being a Space Ranger.
No, it is.  Look, over in that house is a kid who thinks you are the greatest, and it's not because you're a Space Ranger, pal, it's because you're a TOY!  You are HIS toy.
Ahhh!! This is the part where we blow up!
Oh, boy.  Will ya take a look at all those presents?!
MOM!!  MOM!!
A lunchbox?!
No wait!  You don't understand! Buzz is out there!  We've gotta help him!!
It's Sid!
Buzz.  Buzz Lightyear.  You are not worried, are you?
I'm red this time.
Oh...well alright, you can be red if you want.
Bad news?!
You'll put your clothes here.
I want to go home.
He'll murder you when he finds out.
I hope he doesn't pick on Jonathon.
I'm Melanie.
Why does he need money?
How much?
Even if I knew I wouldn't tell you. You do not want to come into contact with these people.  Only Carl knows who they are.  That's his real asset. Ruiz doesn't know them.  They don't know Ruiz.  Church and State.
Laundromats for the washing of money. Unfortunately, Carl had only one successful business.
Like a Grateful Dead Concert.
Where are you going?
What's it like?  Imagine you're being accosted by a swarm of beggars in the heart of Calcutta, except the beggars are wearing $1500 suits and they don't say "please" or "thank you."
Ach, that's what I'm talking about. Sarcasm.  Always fucking sarcasm. You're afraid and you think if you admit it people will think you're weak or won't like you --
Are you getting this on tape?
They're going to walk right past me.
Yes, he threatened to kill my five year-old son.  I was under the impression I would be meeting Juan Obregon.
Why do you say that, Mr. Marquez?
My husband is the victim of an informer in your organization, not ours.
I don't think you're going to do that.
There are plenty of other suppliers in Mexico.
Please.  Filing a report will not help you find your car.
One question.  How did you find about this?
What is the name of your informant?
Who the fuck do you think you are? Where the fuck do you think you are? Why the fuck do you think I shouldn't just put you in a dumpster?
I got money.
I want your money, I'll take your money.
Who are these guys?
Shut you mouth or you'll be next.
Buy yourself that island in the sun?
You're not getting any younger, Mark. The world is changing, music is changing, even drugs are changing. You can't stay in here all day dreaming about heroin and Ziggy Pop.
Whatever. I mean, the guy's dead anyway.
Thank you, Mr. Murphy. We'll let you know.
Who wrote it?
You don't know, do you?
The park?
Who wrote it?
What?
How much?
So?
How's it going with Gail?
How long is it?
Six weeks!
Where did she come up with that?
Six weeks and no sex?
Bad news, gentlemen. Shore leave's been cancelled.
What's Emergency Landing Plan B?
You told me you could have the ship operational  in two weeks. I gave you three. What Happened?
Very well, Mr. Scott. Carry on.
Bird of Prey bearing one zero five mark two.
"Row, row, row your boat..." I love "Row..."  Do - do you know "Row, Row, Row, Row, Row Your Boat?"
When he encouraged others to follow him, he was banished from Vulcan, never to return.
Exactly. That is correct. Sybok's mother was a Vulcan princess. Upon her death, Sybok and I were raised as brothers.
I was not disposed to discuss... matters of a personal nature. For that, I'm sorry.
Spock.
What are you doing?

I am a Starfleet Officer.
Not if my Tron program was running. That would seal the system off. If your file's in there...
Flynn!
Way to go! We're haulin'!
Yes?
Flynn...  Where's Ram?
There's another beam!
Watch it!
Don't even say that. You've got to find that file before he does..
I hope you've enjoyed being a command program, Sark. I wonder how you'll like working in a pocket calculator... maybe one of those watches that plays "Happy Birthday" to its User once a year.
Yes, and now you've got two renegade programs running all the hell over the system in a stolen simulation.
This is Flynn... the one who busted me out.
I'm done.
Faisil.  You're new on Harry's team, aren't you?
So what makes you think that the slack I cut him in any way translates to you?!
See, kids now are ten years ahead    * of where we were at the same age. You probably think she's still a virgin--
Fourteen, Harry.
Station wagon?
Look, uh... I've got to talk to Helen about this thing with Dana. I'm just going to run in and see if she can get away for lunch.
Just hang a minute.
She could be telling the truth.
He's got it.
Let's see... that you can read ancient Sanskrit without having to sound out the words.  And that other dealers and archeologists don't like you much.
How'd it go at the trade show? You make all the other salesmen jealous?
I was in the area, and I thought you might like to have lunch.
They said you had to run out.
This Simon.  Did you sleep with him?
I'm sorry, honey.
What're we talking about here? Pussy, right?
I said SIT DOWN.  Who do you work for?
Of course.  Mrs. Tasker.  And what were you going with the international terrorist, Carlos the Jackal?  Taking dictation?
Are you sure you weren't followed?
Okay.  It's just, things are a bit hot for me right now.  If I get a signal...  I may have to leave suddenly.
Thank you.  You saved my life. What's your name?
You can call me Simon.  You're very brave to do this...  You opened it.
You're gonna be on "T.J. Hooker"?
The letter I sent.
Well, enough about the King. How about you?
Tell me about yourself.
C'mon. What're ya tryin' to be? The Phantom Lady?
You know when you sat behind me?
Uh-huh, I was tryin' to think of somethin' to say to you, then I thought, she doesn't want me bothering her.
I dunno. I guess I'm just stupid.
Where you goin', honey?
It's been fun thinking about the money but I can walk away from it, honey.
Clarence, I gotta hand it to ya. You were cooler than cool.
All anybody saw was Clint Eastwood drinkin' coffee.
Oh, and your line to Charles Atlas in there: "I'll take that gun", "You'll have to".
Money problems?
Yeah, well if we got lost, it's your ass.  Come on, Clarence, lets go. Elliot's going to meet us in the lobby.
Well, enough about the King, how 'bout you?
How 'bout you go to the movies with me tonight?
A Donny Chiba triple feature. "The Streetfighter", "Return of the Streetfighter", and "Sister Streetfighter".
He is, bar none, the greatest actor working in martial arts movies ever.
Elliot.
Now, that's practically uncut. You could, if you so desire, cut it a helluva lot more.
What do you want from me?
Stop acting like an infant. You're here because you want me to help you in some way. What do you need from me? You need money?
Yes, I still have friends on the force.
What makes you think I could do that?
What makes you think I would do that?
You got it all worked out, don't you?
Well, the part you're reading for is one of the bad guys. There's Brian and Marty. Peter Breck's already been cast as Brian. And you're reading for the part of Marty. Now in this scene you're both in a car and Bill Shatner's hanging on the hood.  And what you're trying to do is get him off.  Whenever you're ready.
I don't know. He just appeared as magic.
He's so spooked he'd turn over his momma, his daddy, his two-panny granny, and Anna and the King of Siam if he had anything on him.
You see what you get when you fuck wit me, white boy? You're gonna walk in my goddamn house, my house! Gonna come in here and tell me! Talkin' smack, in my house, in front of my employees. Shit! Your ass must be crazy.  I don't think that white boy's got good sense. Hey, Marty.  He must of thought it was white boy day. It ain't white boy day, is it?
Hello, is Dick Ritchie here?
Do you live here?
Sorta room-mates?
Maybe you can help me. Actually, who I'm looking for is a friend of ours from Detroit. Clarence Worley? I heard he was in town. Might be travelling with a pretty girl named Alabama. Have you seen him? Are they stayin' here?
How do you know? You been there?
The food, the sky, the certain, uh, sexual temptations -- you haven't become "addicted" have you, Cole?  To that "dying" world'
It's the kidnap woman -- the one who was with the guy who tied us up.
Cole!  James Cole!  You escaped from a locked room six years ago.
They're keeping an eye on me.
You smell so good.
It's a Carpet Cleaning Company...
No superiors!  No scientists.  No people from the future.  It's just a Carpet Cleaning Company.  They have voice mail -- you leave a message telling them when you want your carpet cleaned.
What'd they give you?  Thorazine?  How much?  Learn your drugs -- know your doses.
I don't have time to go upstairs.  The police are looking for me.  I need to know where it is and exactly what it is.
Plan?  What are you talking about?
Bulishit!  You're fucking with my head!
He was fully sedated!
Hey!  You there!
Don't call me old man.  Ain't you got no respect, boy?
Yeah I want something.  I want you to run over to that machine and get me a pop.
Hell no, I can't do that myself. I'm blind.  Can't you see that?
What'd you think I was doing out here with these glasses on?  Sunnin' myself?
I ain't got no eyes.  You want to see?
Lost my eyes on Okinawa.  Lost them fighting the war.  Fought the war and lost my eyes just so you could come around here and make fun of me.
Don't be sorry.  Just run over there and get me my pop before I die of thirst.
Change?  You want my change?  I fought the war and lost my eyes just so I could give you my change?
It's a Movado.
You want somethin'?
Nope.  Darrell.
Hey there.  I was beginnin' to think you wasn't comin' back.  You don't look so good.
One of those days you feel like you been runnin' in circles and you ain't no closer to where you tryin' to get than when you started?
Hell, I've had days I would gladly trade with a whippin' dog.  Ain't much you can do when you feel like that 'cept tough it out.
You think bad, and bad is what you get.
No charge.
Two-hundred.
It's going to cost you two-hundred dollars.
Yep.  For the hose.  But while you was gone I replaced a gasket. That's going to run you another fifty.
Yeah, but it was shot.
Well, now, you just know all there is about bein' a mechanic, don't you?  I can't do unauthorized work. I suppose I can just let you ride out of here with a bad gasket.  Then you get in an accident and get killed.  Or worse.  Who they gonna blame then?  They gonna blame me, and there goes my reputation.
Is that an insult?  Are you insulting me.
Take it.  As soon as I get my money. Fifty dollars for an almost new gasket.  You don't know what kind of a deal you're getting.
Lord!  Put the baby in the icebox. Killed the poor thing.
Jake.  I thought you would be at work, dear.
Jesus.
I got it.
My face tell you all that?
How far is it to California?
Have you ever been there before?
Is it pretty?
Take me with you.
Please.  I won't hang on you.  As soon as we get there you can dump me.  I don't care.  I just want to get out of here.
I know where we could get the money. A lot more than one-hundred-fifty dollars.
Jake.
He doesn't give it to us.  We take it.
He's got money.  In a floor safe in the living room.  I've never seen it, but he talks about it all the time.  More like brags.  He loves his money.  Wouldn't think of spending some of it on me.
Yeah, a bird in a gilded cage.
Near as I can figure must be about a hundred-thousand.
Lied?  What do you mean?
It's not a combination lock.  It takes a key.  He keeps it on him all the time.  I mean all the time.  It scratches up against me when we do it.
If you want.
You're crazy, you know that!? You're fucked up!?
Who the hell are you?
Husband . . .?
I . . I was helping your wife.  I met her in town.  She needed a hand with her drapes.  That's all.
I swear to you that's all that happened.  I haven't so much as set foot in your bedroom.
Nice office you've got.
Yeah, well, me too.
You could say.  I don't even have it yet.
He did more work on the car.  He wants fifty bucks extra for it.
It's not like that.
Wait a minute.  Just listen to me--
Jake--
That's not the reason I'm here.  I swear it.
I came for Grace.
I came to kill her.
It's the truth, Jake.
Yeah, well, a couple of hours ago I just about killed some guy over a girl.  Not for money, for a girl. And she was just going to stand there and let it happen, or let him kill me.  Same way Grace played us this morning.  I don't like that, Jake.  Not twice in one day.  And maybe I'm so pissed I'd twist the next off my own Grandma to get out of here.
Hey, Mister.  Mister.  I just. . . I just wanted to thank you.
For defending my honor this afternoon.
But you was going to fight for me.
He's not my boyfriend.  I mean, I let him take me out and stuff, but I ain't spoken for.  Not yet that is.
That's what I thought until you came riding in.  I saw your car over at the gas station.  It's cool.  Want to take me for a ride?  Desert's kind of lonely this time of day.
Eighteen.  Well, I'm gonna be eighteen in two years, but that don't mean you can't take me for a ride if you want.
Get up, Mister!  Don't ever let it be said Toby Tyler beat the living shit out of someone without giving them a fair chance.
I'm doing what any man would do if he'd been offended.  I'm beating you up.
Nice night for a drive.  Morning really.  I guess that's about the only way to keep cool; riding around with the top down on a fancy convertible in the first hours of the day.
Suppose you've had all you can of Sierra.  What with that ruckus you had with Toby.  Oh yes, I heard all about that.
Just cool down, son.  I ain't accusing you of anything.  Serves Toby right to get his ass whooped. If you hadn't done it, somebody else would've.
Hey!  You there!
Don't call me old man.  Ain't you got no respect, boy?
Yeah I want something.  I want you to run over to that machine and get me a pop.
Hell no, I can't do that myself.  I'm blind.  Can't you see that?
What'd you think I was doing out here with these glasses on?  Sunnin' myself?
I ain't got no eyes.  You want to see?
Lost my eyes in Vyee-et-nam.  Lost them fighting the commies.  Fought the war and lost my eyes fightin' the commies just so you can come around here and make fun of me.
Don't be sorry.  Just run over there and get me my pop before I die of thirst.
Change?  You want my change?  I fought the war and lost my eyes just so I could give you my change?
Time's up. Any last words of wisdom?
Who the hell is this!?
I've done a few things but I'm not a murderer, Mr. McKenna.
That's my gun... That fucking Darrell!
Hey mister. Mister, I just... I just wanted to thank you.
For defending my honor this afternoon.
But you was going to fight for me.
He's not my boyfriend.  I mean, I let him take me out and stuff, but I ain't spoken for.  Not yet that is.
That's what I thought until you came riding in.  I saw your car over at the gas station.  It's a cool car.  Want to take me for a ride?  Desert's kind of lonely this time of day.
Eighteen... Well, I'm gonna be eighteen in two years, but that don't mean you can't take me for a ride if you want.
Accident.
I'm very interested in this but is there someplace...
What you want?
It's very nice of you to help me.  That package is kind of heavy, and it's so hot.
I like them.  I was sick of looking at this room.  I think they add a little life.
You mean the Shaman?
Are you sure?...  About me, I mean?
You said you couldn't kill anybody.
No Grace, my hand's bothering me.
<u>Jake</u>...
Twenty-seven, fifty.  That's all I got.
You fuck this guy -- get him to do your dirty work and you think you can take the money and dump me?
Help me, Grace, help...
Proceed.
Is that what you wanted to ask me?
Is there anything else you wanted to ask me while I'm up?... When was the last time you wore pink? When was the last time you drank soup standing up? Final call for strange questions at two in the morning.
He didn't do anything. He just told me his theory... It's sad when patients get like that. They loose reality.
I assumed because of the train.
I thought he was carrying something.
He's doing well today.
He's kind of a miracle.
How much did you take off?
You like sports?
What a coincidence? I'm a male synchronized swimmer and I'm looking for representation.
Now you're going to have to tell me more.
How so?
You and my mother would have a special connection.
You just kicked the shit out of a innocent man, you big asshole.
We never seen him up against any... like these ones... killers.
I didn't mean... with me. Alice and Silky, they'll give you one... if you want.
Shut up, Alice. Little Bill, a whippin' ain't gonna settle this.
This here's a lawful contract... betwixt me an' Delilah Fitzgerald, the cut-whore. Now I brung her clear from Boston, paid her expenses an' all, an' I got a contract which represents an investment of capital.
Damaged property. Like if I was to hamstring one of their cow ponies.
You work for the railroads too, Mister Beauchamp?
"Well, Jim," I says, "it makes me sick to see a man struttin' around and packin' two pistols an' a Henry rifle and cryin' like a baby."
He said that, huh?
Schofield? You from Schofield?
Oh.
About what?
What for?
Jesus!
Get some sleep, Kid.
It's gonna get riper yet.
Yeah, he's in there.
He's in there.
Yup.
I trust you, Bill.
Three ways?
Jesus.
Me an' the Kid, we'll head over to the ranch an' as soon as we find him, we'll shoot him. Then we'll come back an' the three of us pick up the money an' head South together.
I'll bet anything he won't go to town nor he won't ride out on the range. Right off he'll hole up at the ranch.
Clouds, Kid. We was lookin' at them clouds on account of we got a storm ridin' up our ass.
Jack. What are you doing here?
Yeah.
...and the desk Sergeant is actually trying to tell me he can't release you? Can you believe that? You weren't even charged. New York police - Jesus. I want to take pictures of your face to bring to the D.A. first thing in the morning.
How many times have you been in a line- up? It's always you and four dummies. The P.D. pays homeless guys ten bucks a head half the time. No way they'd line five felons in the same row. No way. And what the hell is a voice line-.up? A public defender could get you off of that.
It was the Feds. A truck load of guns gets snagged, Customs comes down on N.Y.P.D. for some answers - they come up with us. They're grabbing at straws. It's politics - nothing you can do.
He's alright.
What the hell do you want?
I did you a favor by standing up for you last night, but don't think we're friends. I'm sorry, but I have other things -
We'll make it.
You set up the line-up.
What about Redfoot?
Get a grip. I didn't know.
His name was Arturo Marquez. A petty smuggler out of Argentina. He was arrested in New York last year for trafficking. He escaped to California and got picked up in Long Beach. They were setting up his extradition when he escaped again. Get this - Edie Finneran was called in to advise the proceedings.
You keep trying to lay this whole ride on                 t Keaton. It wasn't like that. Sure he knew, but Edie had him all turned around.                 r I'm telling you straight, I swear.                        +
You got him wrong.
Then what?
What call?
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
He was accused of jury tampering.
Four cases in three years ...
... tell me about this case.
No -- we don't want this case in court.
I want to settle this thing and be done with it.  I don't want the Archdiocese exposed.
So what I want to do is stop it here.  I'm going to make him an offer.  I want to do it myself.  I want it to come from me.
Whatever the `truth' is, let's hear that.  You were her doctor.
Say it.
You were the anesthesiologist at her delivery May twelfth, nineteen seventy...
Answer affirmatively.  Simply. Keep those answers to three words. You weren't `part of a group,' you were her anesthesiologist.  Isn't that right?
You were there to help Dr. Marx deliver her baby.  Were you not?
Your Honor, Bishop Brophy and the Archdiocese have offered plaintiff two hundred and ten thousand dollars.
...the Archdiocese called up, they said who was our attorney, 'cause the case is coming to trial...
... we told them we didn't want it to come out this way.
I have some errands to run, and then I thought we'd spend the evening...
I'm going to take you to the home to see the girl...
Yes.  Yes.  I think so.  I hope you'll be comfortable.  I'm putting you up at my...
...apartment.   No, no. Please.  You don't know who we're dealing with, I, please believe me, they...
These people play very rough. They don't want to lose this case. There's a lot of pressure they can bring to bear, I...
Yes.
That's it...?    Come on, guys...life is too short...  You tell me if you're playing 'chicken,' or you mean it.    Frank:  I don't think I'm talking out of school, but I just heard someone offer you two hundred grand...and that's a lot of money...and if I may say, you haven't got the best of records.
...that's true.  Sometimes they change, sometimes they don't. Now, I remember back to when you were disbarred...
And it seems to me, a fella's trying to come back, he'd take this settlement, and get a record for himself.    I myself would take it and run like a thief.
I object, your Honor...
Exception!
Do you think it's my fault?
That's not the question.  It's over.  Do you think that it's my fault?  If I'd...if I'd...I never should have taken it.  There was no way that I was going to win.
Are you out of your mind...?
You need my help...?  You need a goddamn keeper...are you telling me that you turned down two-hundred- ten grand?    Huh...?  Are you nuts?  Eh?  Are you nuts. What are you going to do, bring her back to life?
To do what...?  To do what, for chrissake...?   To help her to do what?  She's dead...
How are you holding up?
And all we've got is a witch doctor!
I talked to Johnnie White at the Bar Association.   The broad used to work for one of Concannon's partners in New York awhile ago.   She wanted to move to Boston.    How badly did she hurt us, Joe?
Thank you.
Who told you that?
Mrs. Simmonds.
I used to be a nurse.
Stearns, Harrington, you know who that is?
A huge law firm.  Okay?  They put him in the firm, he's married, everything's superb.  Franky, he's starting to talk like he comes from Dorsetshire, some fuckin' place, 'You must drop by with Pat and me...'  Okay...?
...and he's making a billion dollars every minute working for Stearns, Harrington, and he bought a dog, and everything is rosy.   Then Mr. Stearns, he tried to fix a case.
That Frank was working on.  Yeah. He thought Franky needed some help, so they bribed a juror.  So Franky finds out.  He comes to me in tears. He thinks that anybody who knows what a 'spinnaker' is got to be a saint.  I told him ' Franky, wake up.  These people are sharks. What do you think they got so rich from?  Doing good?'  He can't be comforted.  He tells the boys at Stearns and Harrington they've disappointed him, he's going to the Judge to rat them out.
Before he can get there here comes this Federal Marshal, and Franky's indicted for Jury tampering, they throw him in jail, he's gonna be disbarred, his life is over.   Jimmy, gimme another drink.    How are you?
Watched her come out of the apartment, someone I didn't know... walking in a different way... holding her head in a way I didn't know; and get into her car, and drive out to...  Golden Gate Park. Five miles. She sat on a bench at the edge of the lake and stared across the water to the old pillars that stand an the far shore, the Portals of the Past. Sat there a long time, not moving... and I had to leave, to got to the office. That evening, when I came home, I asked what she'd done all day. She said she'd driven to Golden Gate Park and sat by the lake. That's all.
The speedometer of her car showed she had driven 94 miles that day. Where did she go?  I have to know, Scottie. Where she goes and what she does, before I got involved with doctors.
Yes, but carefully. I'd want to know more before committing her to that kind of care.  Scottie --
I want you.
Just let me talk to you.
You.
I like that one.
You don't even want to touch me.
We're going awfully far.
I made it.
When you...  There were pins in my hair...
Good-bye.
Where were you born?
Don't leave me... stay with me...
There are things I have to tell you, about how we met, and why we are together. But they can wait. The only important thing now is that I love you and I'm going to keep you safe.
Why?
Where?
Madeleine --
Midge, do you suppose many men wear corsets?
How do you know? Personal experience?
What do you mean?
You sound so disapproving, Midge.
I had to quit, Midge.
I wake up at night seeing him fall from the roof... and try to reach out for him.
I know. Everybody tells me.
I know. I have Acrophobia. What a disease. A fear of heights. And what a moment to find out I had it.
And sit behind a desk?  Chairborne?
Not with my Acrophobia, Midge. If I dropped a pencil on the floor and bent down to pick it up, it could be disastrous!
Now, that's the kind of greeting a girl likes.  None of this "hello you look wonderful" stuff. Just a good straight "who do you know" --
Professor Saunders, over in Berkeley.
Oh!  You mean Gay Old Bohemian Days of Gay Old San Francisco!  The juicy stories? Like who shot who in the Embarcadero August, 1879?
Pop Leibel.
Pop Leibel owns the Argosy Book Shop. What do you want to know?
What have you been doing?
She's fucking hot!
I was just playing...we were playing just playing around.
Four hours and fifteen minutes. I can make Vegas in 3 and change.
Stop it!
Just stop.
I'm calling the police.
Now I am the last to say that we have done here is a good thing. It's not. It's not a good thing. But it was, given the circumstances, the smart play. We did what had to be done. And...well...I'm proud of us. I'm proud of each and every one of us. We performed. Under the most complex and nerve shattering of situations, we stood fast and we delivered. I feel proud.
Where's the candy?
Have you thought about what I said?
I got a migraine like a little monkey kicking in the side of my skull, Mike Tyson with a fucking sledge hammer trying to crack...
She's not here.
Where do you look? What side of the neck?
Not really.  Yes, the Fisher wedding chairs...
Micheal, now is probably not the best time for this.
After you drop the kids off, take Micheal home. Put a few drinks in him so he'll sleep.
Just do it.
Take care of business.
And what does that mean?  Are you insane?!  You think I would hurt Lois?! She's the mother of those kids! What is wrong with you?
I don't hate women.
False.
Not true.
I am a lover. In Africa, you can stay king as long as you can service your women every night.
Stop.
He just doesn't talk a lot.
He's a great chef.
You expect more what?
Time out.

He kept saying he was protected.
Like if something happened to him, he could still get us.
I don't know. He could have told someone. He could have, like in the event of his death, somehow let someone know where those bodies are buried.
So what do we do?
Dear God...I don't know how to pray.
I told her that I have no idea what Adam was talking about in that letter.
I have no idea.
We don't think so. I mean, we just want the singing when I come out.
We're just going to have the leader of the band sing alone with his guitar. Acoustic.
"You Send Me."
You see for me it's over. Over baby. I'm gonna turn myself in. After the wedding of course. After the wedding. Out of respect.
Don Amalio!
Enedina and Paco ...
What do you mean?
If you only knew ... When I was young I was full of idealism. I wanted to do something on a big scale for others, something to show my great love for humanity. But as soon as I tried to do something about it, I became afraid that I would be laughed at and I felt like a fool ... and so I went back into my shell.
Why don't you ask her to stay on for a few days?
How much is that?
That's fifteen by seven?
She's mad.
Me, rich? Come on!
Jorge. You frightened me. What's happening to you?
Well... is it so urgent?
It's for people!
It's a very big one.
Yes -- very, very big!
I have no desire to see the world again, but if you order me to...
She looks like a sick marrow!

Why would they be going there?

That's also where Mr. Barnes lost his arms to Mathew Grimes' booby trap. What's your point, Dr. Carter?
Not if you're with him every step of the way.
How does he know who I am?
All they want to produce around here is mediocrity!
It was you, wasn't it?
You amped the neural connectors back up, didn't you?  You're the reason the convict died. You're the reason I got fired!
My God...
What do you expect me to do, put your character module in my pocket and just walk you out of here?
Every day for the last five years, I told myself someday I would be out here again. No more bars. No more guards. No more fights just to stay alive.  Every day for the last five years, I told myself that lie.
I am the demon from the bottomless pit...
I am impressed.
Who said that?
What the hell's going on?!
We know you didn't kill those guards.
Where the hell are you going?

Let's get things straight, Bud. I'm not going to take a cut. I worked hard and you can't decorate a room in New York for less than $100,000. Curtains alone...
You got it all charted out don't you, like a stock projection.
Hi.
Frankly, Carl, I can't see giving much more. If you have any suggestions I'll be glad to listen.
I beg your pardon. Is that a proverb?
Considering you brought my mother into it, $71.50.
We need to talk. CHINA Yeah about what?
Us is over.  You had your chance you blew it.
A little what? CHINA See.  You don't even speak French.
Yeah well why should I suffer for that?
Hello?
No Jonathan.
She went to a waxwork party
Can I give her a message?
Well?
If you sold your soul to the devil, you'd never age either
Any student of Black Magic can do it.   .most of these books will tell you how! SARAH So what happens when you've sold out?
Besides, Dad would have freaked.
I think playing in a band called "Bitch" might put a dent in the whole "perfect family" thing.
She finished my solitaire game and turned on the radio...she likes rock and roll. Angry rock and roll.
I saw her in the water.  Beside me.  She was filling the bathtub.
Pretty.  She's a blond.
Um...I'd rather not say...just yet.
How're you holding up?
He's so...it's too much...and I can't...I can't breath...
You must think I'm pathetic.
Wow.
Wow.  I'm losing it.
Okay.  Okay.
You've got a beautiful life.  And even with this, it's always been clear that he loves you.  I've come to think that's all that really matters.
If you have to work...
Honey, they're young.  They're probably newlyweds.
Remember how we were?
Why?
It was there.  This angry music all by itself.  And I heard whispering.
It's a flare.
From the sun.  It's a reflection on the glass.
What are you doing out here?
This is the Feur thing?
You were lost in the music...eyes closed...your chest heaving...
We walked all night...
I was there.
I came to work in the garden and I saw you with her...in my house.
What's that for?
I'm cooking you dinner.
I know.
Are you alright...?  You look pale.
Don't tell Rowan about this.
Always give the crovd a taste, darling.  Now - Ryan said I'm supposed to make sure -
She was alive all these years... You NEVER let me know her. Who gave you that right...?!
I might as well be Rowan Smith - or Jones!   you cut me off from every -
Mum...  Oh Mum, God will surely strike us -
STOP!
I've waited for you - the one whose science could match her powers...  Do you know what it's like - to sense the majesty of something so sublime just beyond your reach...?  to float in a dream that keeps a .promise half-hidden in its shadows.-.?  I did not choose to be such as this!  Suzanne brought me here.  She called to me!
Put - him - down!  His - his heart...
Harder...
HARDER!
You look very deep when you do that.  It's interesting.  We're Complete opposites-  I'd never just sit and wait for insparation.  I'd skip my turn and swap some letters.
Go to LAX and get on a flight to New Orleans.  Go to the Ponchartrain Hotel and wait for me.  I'll call you there.
I'll bet she had a wonderful smile.
Wanna snack...?
You alright...?
I've never asked you to explain yourself - because you used to let me inside!  But I'm on the outside now...  you put me there!
Why bother to ask, Ro...?  Why don't you just make me stay,..?
How 'bout a backward hex with a three-quarter twist...?
A few hours and I'll be wasting away in Margaritaville.  Oh, sweet decadance.
I thought you were someone else
This must be one of the old keys -
Oh, about six years since I graduated
I don't know
No - the police say I've killed fourteen - but I've not - I've killed many more. It amazes me how they just haven't found the bodies. What is society coming to when people just don't get missed. I agree, some of them are well hidden - I probably couldn't even show you where I put them - one girl, number eight I think the press called it - she wasn't even mine - I don't know who did it but I didn't
Oh anywhere - whenever I needed to - Do you know how easy it is to take them? You just pick up a hiker, or someone off the streets - they believe so easily you know, 'Look, I have something to show you' I would say - and that would be it. One girl, I think her name is Debbie - she had broken down on the motorway, and I offered to take her to a service station to call for a tow truck - She just got in and I drove away. When I pulled into the layby and took out my knife - she just froze, and said - what do you want? - I said, You know what I want. - But she didn't. Getting rid of the bodies is just as easy - the first I cut up, put in bags with bricks in, and tossed them off Eldridge Bridge in broad daylight.  The real problem with my work is the blood - there is so much of it - and it all spurts out so fast - like a fountain. It made such a mess of
I don't know
Didn't DEBBIE deserve anymore?
What did you do with her?
You think I killed my MOTHER don't you?
We've got nothing to talk about
I loved you ELLEN - why did you do this?
It did give me a chance to meet you again ELLEN - It's all routine you understand...So where were you?
As it happens, I was at home alone - maybe we could solve each others problems?
Dr STECKLER?
I defy your hamburger theory of life, and all of the unfulfilled hopes and dreams it represents.
I wonder how many of them will be at the orgy tonight?
Oh. Well. Maybe not yet.
A couple of boys fighting over a pair of red silk panties is nothing compared to what he's seen.
Every one of these women thinks she should be the next Angel of the Month. It's your job, Ted, to decide which of them is right.
If it isn't straight by now, son, you probably should see a doctor.
We don't generally feature blow-up dolls in our magazine. But hey, if you think there's a market for it.
I remember the first time you walked into Mrs. Temple's class in 2nd grade. Blue gingham dress. Blond ponytail.
We're not ashamed of you, Teddy. We don't approve of the magazine or the models or the so-called "flesh parties" you attend. But we can get past all that.
I paid off the mortgage! I ordered that Winnebago you always wanted! Now you're ashamed of me?
Or do you have a taste for the good life, Ted? It's in your blood.
It's a little more serious than that, Bill. The stockholders have requested a meeting. They want our guarantee that this will never happen again.  Some of them are even calling for Ted's resignation.
That's it? I mean, you don't want to order room service or anything? We could play games and watch movies and stuff.
Are they okay?
I miss them, too.
You're a peach.
What do you want from me? I'm trying to be fair. But I can't keep you on staff if you turn every PTA meeting into an Agent Orange cover up.
Me?
Cut to the chase, William Randolph. Your audience is way ahead of you.
That's two words. And I'm out of the "exposed" business, remember? I need to graduate. Besides, Merk's a boy scout.
You forget, I dislike YOU at least as much as him.
And I thought maybe I'd take up boating. I've always wanted to be a "coxswain."
The thing is, I'll need a first mate.
You don't have to work another day in your lives.
Smashing!  Welcome to the family, Ted. You are going to breathe some new life into this place. You are going to set the world on fire! You are going to...call me Uncle Billy? Please?
I told you you could do it.
You were the new and improved you.
No one will be laughing at you now, Ted. You can take that to the bank.
You ARE home. But go ahead, finish school, do what you feel you need to do. In the meantime, I'll be your point person here on the magazine.
I've been very lazy for a long, long time.
I never finished school myself. Never had to. My brother built this empire from nothing but his wife's perky tits and a whole lot of gumption. He gave me a cushy job on a silver platter. I never struggled for a second.
It's not like I didn't have ideas, I had plenty of ideas. But I never even shared them with your father. Never had the guts.
Well...for one thing...I think it's despicable that we exclude so many women that only fit our western notion of "classic beauty."
The world is a big, beautiful place.  We can open new markets in Africa and Asia.  Imagine the Dali Lhama reading our magazine.
At our press conference tomorrow, I think we should announce our plans to explore the world. Not just a few leggy 36D's, with blond hair upstairs and down.
What are you doing?
How you doing, Artie?
Wasn't enough Van Ryan had to destroy the people who invested here.  He got to be old, he and his rich cronies would come down here, hunt and whore, act like assholes.  One trip he showed up with this young girl he'd picked up somewhere, gotten her pregnant then dumped her in the swamp.  That came with her.
She had it, before she drank herself to death.  Wasn't exactly a love child...
How long?
Maybe she used another name.
That's what they called it when I was in Juvenile.  It's a pretty dismal place.
It's starting, Gloria.  This is how it begins...
You didn't tell me you were gonna put me on the fucking news.
Oh, Ray... no...
This wasn't my idea.
You're gonna fuck me over, aren't you?
You are.
Is that Sam Lombardo?
Look, he forgot.  I knew it.
Kelly.  Is Suzie there?
Shit.  I was afraid of that.  She left this garbled message on my machine.  Can you calm her down?
No!  Christ.  Listen, Kelly, I'm counting on you.  You calm her down. I mean do whatever you have to, whatever it takes...
Can't you take that stupid thing off?
You ought to watch it with that shit, Suzie.  You get busted again, you go back in a two-tine loser.
But you do admit to touching her, to putting your arm around her.  Isn't that against the rules?
Yeah, right.
Sandy... What's up?
No.
Didn't you see her this morning?
Your little jack-in-the-box gun. That might be useful.
Now, what was that?
You might have mentioned you had that.
Got to be somewhere that's hot. He said it was "damnably hot."
Are those just button buttons or...?
He calls it the Tarantula.
You must excuse the Doctor.  No one has ever beaten him at his little game.
Would you be thinking... ramming speed, sir?
Where'd he say he was going to do this?
The U.S. is my jurisdiction.
Now it's a bomb.
You gonna be a hero, Madmartigan? I've lost half my men fighting Kael, and Bavmorda, and the Nock- maar army.  Now you and this Peck, and that magpie up in the rafters, are gonna take 'em on alone?
They look like acorns.
I do what I'm told.
Bavmorda cannot transform you. I've protected this camp with a spell.
I'll be around long after you're dead, Airk!  You slime!  When I get outa here I'll cut your head off and stick it on a pig-pole!
Where's the baby??
She asked about you, Madmartigan.
I could be you rguard!  I could carry your spear!
We don't have much time left!  Go on!  Go on!
What's the magician's weapon?
I did it!  Madmartigan!  Come here! Look!  You gotta see this!  I did it!
We gotta follow them.
Talk!  Say something!
Where's Timmy and Buck?
You've got a man here and the kids are upstairs?
Who'd you see, Sam? The man on the floor?
What's your first move?
Look, I'm genuinely sorry...
They kid a lot.
Who are they?
Eli is a fine carpenter. Best in the district. He and his father built the big house themselves forty years ago.
We had some lemonade and he left.
Listen carefully, I wrote the Amish woman's name and address on my desk calendar, I want you to lose it for me, Now. Tonight.
Nothing. I'm not going to be around for a while. I'll call you when I can.
Everything okay?
John said you're Amish.
I am not a child.
I will be the judge of that.
Is this where we're going?
Poor little orphan, and her Miss Gulch troubles. Gosh all hemlock - you know, she ought to have somebody to play with.
Yes.
If you were really great and powerful, you'd keep your promises!
No!  No -- no!  Here -- you can have your old slippers -- but give me back Toto.
Are you ready now?
...room --
...m...m...my, my, my, my goodness -- I can talk again! Oh -- oil my arms, please -- oil my elbows.
And bears!
Now I know I've got a heart -- 'cause it's breaking.
Who's her?  Who's her?
Oh -- Oh -- Oh!  Toto -- Toto!
Whhhooops!  Ha-ha -- there goes some of me again!
Oh, no -- I just keep picking it up and putting it back in again.
...just that the Witch is so wicked. I don't think you two ought to come with me because you'll get into trouble.
Oh -- Oh --
Comin' to think of it, forty winks wouldn't be bad.
Where -- where do we go now?
There. Now, that's the best we can do without any pins.
...of the West.
Hey, Dorothy!
Who do you suppose they were? And where did they take her? A fine thing - to go to pieces at a time like this!
Oh, dear, dear.
Well --
They wont get far. Every warhead has a locator card.  A Miratom device.  Emits a high-pitched signal on Russian emergency frequencies. We can track the bomb.
Do you know what youre doing?
Elektra?  Running King Industries?  Ive known that girl all her life. Im not sure she knows what shes walking into.
Not the usual Swiss procedure, Mr. Bond, but you understand, a man in my position..
He was my father.
I cant stay.
How did you survive?
Was this all about the oil?
That is 5,000 dollars of Beluga ruined!
In the good old days, the KGB had three or four spots where our submarines could surface without anyone knowing. But Yevgeny is supposed to be loading cargo.
Everythings under control up here.  Are you ready?
Had a lot of blood in him.
No idea who's behind this?
I guess you'll be dismantling Russian tanks soon.
Then it's going to happen.  The world's going to end.  -- And you've always known.
Who?
She's with me.
Christ yes, I went in for a cancer scan first thing.  Gave me a couple of rough nights, I'll tell you . . .  How about you, Laurie?
-- What is it.
Laurie --
What?
Hiya, pardner.  Long time no see.
Sorry, Daniel.  You've always been a good friend.  I know that.  Sorry about Laurie.
Their real names, please.
You're lying, Miss Juspeczyk.
You're not "protecting" anyone.  These people's lives may depend on the answers you give.  These are all former associates of Dr. Manhattan --
Terrorist.  Radical agitator.  Stool pigeon.
Congratulations, you've just graduated at the head of your class.
Thanks.
We seen this kind of parachutes before, you know. U.S. Army. You got some friends here, jump out with you guys?
Where are you going?
I was invited. What's your story?
So what's the plan with this Ahab? Are they selling it or what?
We've got to find out what it is. Can you handle that?
What's that?
You're what? What the hell have you been doing?
Where'd the damn truck go?!
The Peace conference...
What...?
You're serious?
This is so typical. I can't believe you. I've barely seen you for the last three weeks and now this? Are you out of your mind?
You can't just propose to me out of nowhere. You think that's going to solve our problems? I'm sorry, X. It was a kick for a while, but it's over. You're just not going anywhere.
Who's writing this dude's dialogue?
I had to inspect the merchandise first.
And you. Why do you have such a problem staying away, my friend? Did you miss us that much?
What's wrong with him?
I'm o.k.  I'm o.k.
This was taken by a state police officer in Secaucus, New Jersey.  A man in a minor altercation literally melted the car in front of him.  I don't know where you come from, Ms. Grey, but where I come from, you don't go melting people's cars when they cut you off.  You do it the old fashioned way -- you give 'em the finger.  But what you presume to tell this committee -
What are you going to do?
Why?  You have a home here now, if you want it.  Everyone will...
I wouldn't really have let you die, you know.  I just needed...
Yes, sir.
Darling!
Surprised?
Miss me?
Are you suggesting I call him master???
What are you waiting around for, pickle puss?
Isn't it true that Darwin preserved a piece of vermicelli in a glass case until, by some extraordinary means, it actually began to move with voluntary motion?
Vermicelli.
Suit yourself...I'm easy.  Better watch out for the wockers.
The wockers with the knockers.
What a filthy job!
How?
Cold!  Cold and dead!
Repeat it anyway -- it's a wonderful cue.
No, no!  That whole thing!
MMMMMMMMMMMMMNNNNNNmmmmmmmm?!?
May I see your violin?
Ooh!
What are you going to do?
It wouldn't be fair to Elizabeth.
No, not sound.
Another fifteen seconds to go.
Oh... indeed. Crealock, we should see that Colonel Dumford has an Officer for his hard riders. Perhaps a subaltern from the Twenty Fourth.
Stuart?
How quickly can you move your artillery forward?
Well, fed or hungry, Pulleine wants them in position immediately. .
