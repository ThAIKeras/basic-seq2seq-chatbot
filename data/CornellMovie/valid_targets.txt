Well, I thought we'd start with pronunciation, if that's okay with you.
Okay... then how 'bout we try out some French cuisine.  Saturday?  Night?
Eber's Deep Conditioner every two days. And I never, ever use a blowdryer without the diffuser attachment.
What good stuff?
Like my fear of wearing pastels?
I don't have to be home 'til two.
It means that Gigglepuss is playing at Club Skunk and we're going.
What do you think?
After that, I swore I'd never do anything just because "everyone else" was doing it.  And I haven't since. Except for Bogey's party, and my stunning gastro-intestinal display --
I wanted to let you make up your own mind about him.
It's just a party. Daddy.
Because they're bred to.  Their mothers liked guys like that, and their grandmothers before them. Their gene pool is rarely diluted.
Joey Dorsey?  Perma-shit-grin.  I wish I could say he's a moron, but he's number twelve in the class.  And a model.  Mostly regional stuff, but he's rumored to have a big tube sock ad coming out.
Okay!  I wasn't sure
She's partial to Joey, not me
What do you think?
Are you lost?
We don't chat.
We're not.
Does it matter?
I was in the laundromat. I saw your car. Thought I'd say hi.
What?
C'mon.  It's not that bad
What?
No, Daddy.
Parts of it.
The part where Bianca beat the hell out of some guy.
What's the matter?  Upset that I rubbed off on her?
Dorsey can plow whoever he wants. I'm just in this for the cash.
Touch of the flu.
Your daughters went to the prom.
Absolutely not.
Blind faith is what I consider heresy!
You don't usually ask.
Yes... Yes, I do... On all of them!
Forgive me, Don Colon.  But what about gold?
Chief says -- he has a God.
Chief says...
Damn all of you!  You all set up theories based on what?  You never leave the safety of your studies! Go out!  Find out what the world is about and then tell me something I can listen to!
Surely you can do anything you want.
Savagery is what monkeys understand.
You will regret this.
We weren't expecting immediate profits, were we?  We must have faith.  We must give time for time.
Your father put cigarettes out on you?
Can I see your back?
I know.
They're not gonna send you right back.
No, no, don't talk to Immigration!
Vodka tonic.
Police.  We'd like to ask you a few questions.
Homicide, Miss Hearn.  It's Detective Eddie Flemming.  Open up.
Look, I'm not even sure she has anything to do with this.  I saw her outside after the fire - thought it was a lead. Maybe she saw something.  Maybe she was visiting somebody here.  Who knows?
Raw deal.
I can't talk right now.  We have some things to take care of.
Not chopped up.  Not chopped up like that.  I mean, what do I got left? Coupla articles.  A medal or two. Plaque here and there and in a coupla years no one remembers me anymore.
I'm not moody.
My father was.  He gave me many lessons about fire.  Now it's my friend.
Yes sir.
We have no money.  Come on.
What does it look like?  It's an address book!
Credit?
Yes.  But there's only one problem - you want credit but the problem is - I don't share credit.
Of course he's moody.  He thinks he's in love.
No way!  He's mine!
He's my collar!
He's yours but I take him in!  I'll drive him to the precinct, you can have him but I'm walkin' him in.
He knew all along.
That's why he was so quiet.  He was testing us.
Look, you can't shoot him in cold blood.
Sure, what is it?
What's up?
Yes?
Well, now that we've got one that's actually failed, we should be able to figure out what's happened and fix it.
I'm goin to do this myself, Hal. Let me have the control, please.
Hal, switch to manual hibernation control.
Yes, I know that sweetheart.
No, I'm sorry, darling, I told you I won't be home for a few days.
In three days, darling, I hope.
Please, it really doesn't matter.
Yes, very pleasant.
Fine.
How can you tell it was deliberately buried?
Any clue as to what it is?
Hal, I'm going out now to replace the A.O. unit.
Hal, maintain normal E.V.A. condition.
Hal, check all airlock doors secure.
Fuck off.  I don't know what the hell you're talkin' about.
I don't give a shit who you ask.
Yeah, i been waiting three years.
No, baby, nothin' like that. Look, there's a place across the street. We can go right over there...
No, it's gotta be here and now. Believe me. Only I don't have the damn money for a room...
What are you talking about? We didn't kill her ...
You just don't get it, do your Reggie?  There isn't any deal. I own your ass.
Get this.  We ain't partners. We ain't brothers.  We ain't friends. I'm puttin' you down and keepin' you down until Ganz is locked up or dead.  And if Ganz gets away, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
She's got the same complaint as half the Goddamn population.  She can't get the job she's trained for and it pisses her off... Anyway, what the fuck do you care?
My kind of place. I always liked country boys.
Not likely, convict.
Depends on how things work out. I believe in the merit system. So far you haven't built up any points.
I let women get to me.  The quest for pussy is the meaning of life ... I got my own personal philosophy about 'em.  Keep women separate from guns, money and business ... women are for spending money.  They got nothing to do with helping you make it.
What about Ganz?
Naw, you didn't let me down.  It was a long shot all the way.  We gave 'em a good run at it.
No trouble, Jack. But, listen, suppose I stay a crook?  Where'd you get the idea that you could catch me?
Yeah.
The truth hurts, doesn't it, buddy?
Okay.  See you in the morning... you know, you ought to get some rest...
What'd you do?
I guess he got the message...
Positive self-image problem all over again ... You are who you decide you are unless you're the type that lets assholes decide for you.
I do think all psychotherapy is bullshit. But just because I think it's bullshit doesn't mean I don't know something about it.
Hey, you know what I really think?
I think you're ashamed to tend bar which is sad because you look great in that outfit they make you wear... You pull down four bills a week which is damn good, and you mix the best Pina Coladas I've ever had... I think that if you need bigger and better things ... then go for em.
Elaine, look, I'm in the middle of sone stuff right now... I'm not gonna have time to come by. I don't know when I can get there.
What do I know?  I'm just a bartender.
What do you want?
Naw, right here's okay.
No, I'm not proud of myself... But we don't have the luxury of choice.
I brought the girl remember?
One more reason to shoot first eh?
Learning our history! The last 5000 years that she missed! She's been out of circulation a while, you know.
They are... with me...
You're not that bad... Come on we'll get you to a doctor.
I get it! You want to make me beg, is that it?
Uh... not really.
Nothing! Swear to God, I didn't do nothing!
Uh..you're welcome.
And you can't concentrate with me around?.
Been here long?
Don't worry, Sir. I have the perfect one.
Yes, Mr. Zorg, I hear you perfectly! So, how was the concert?
Yes, Sir!
Right away, Sir. I'll send you a new one to the hotel.
I understand.
I know.
Why the gun?
There's nothing harder.
What you see is what I got, mister.
There ain't no such thing as snuff. Why don't you fuck off?
Brooklyn.  Don't be late.
Move it, dirtbag... !
Don't bore me with that bullshit.
I had three jerkoffs trying to return your tapes last month.  Do you know how bad a skin flick has to be for some jackass to come back into my place with a fucking receipt, and try to fucking return it?
The only thing wrong is the cheap, softcore crap you're peddling, Eddie.  Where do you get this stuff?
Get together some upscale product where the girls still have teeth in their head.  Till then, fuck you.
Yeah... guess so.
Pardon me?
Well, it's tempting, but no thanks.
I'll risk it.
A weirdo making S+M films?  Who'd have thought it?
Specialty product.
Where does he sell it?
Nothing illegal, it's always borderline.  Like if some freak wants to see a transvestite in a full rubber immersion suit getting an enema from a...
He cuts all kinds of other stuff into his movies; photographs, newsreel footage, subliminal images. Thinks he's making art.
I'm a working stiff, pops.
You want me to come out there and play private eye?
See ya.
I try to be.
Mrs. Christian... please, will you sit down a moment?  I want you to listen carefully. What you're talking about is a "snuff film."  But, from what I know, snuff films are a kind of... urban myth.  Like, red light district folklore.  There's no such thing, I can assure you.
I don't understand, who are... ?
Yes, but...
Yes.
Yes, Mister Welles, thank you.
It is...was. It's a zapper, it might help me stay awake.
We have matching luggage.
Is there something we can do?
It was Freddy.
I saw it. It was my dream.  I brought Sheila in...
Avoid-all-contact-day.
When dad's popping aspiring like popcorn, it's avoid-all-contact-day.
You're not taking my baby!
He's inside you, where he hides.
To take a picture.
When Dan died you weren't even asleep. You said so.  End of story.
If they actually bothered to bury her.
I'm very fucking sorry, but Greta is dead today.  Could we interest you in someone else?
That's their problem.
Makes you look like a nun--
He invited me to his house last night.
Yes?
Not <u>alone</u>, you're not!
What's goin' on in here, Lad? What - ?
Radiation level...constantly rising...
Who with?
Minus three.
The pattern.  Each incident occurred almost precisely a thousand statute miles from the Pole.  A line through the points of occurrence makes almost a complete circle...
What is the Northcountry Development Association?
Twombley involved?
He musta found out. They had to get rid of him. And Jack'll get blamed.
Follow close. We'll cross the next meadow.
Piece of fucking cake.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Watch this snow. It's coming down tonight.
You two, don't you get it? He's using you. You're his slaves.  Jesus Christ, Jack, don't you see that?
Yeah, you can have the key. It's the key that's kept me locked to you all these years. I give it to you with pleasure.  Now I'm free. See how easy it is, Jack? All you got to do is give back what the man gave you, and you're free of him.  I've got to call my brother.
See you tomorrow, maybe.
Yeah.
Think they're alright?
How?
I was... I'm Wade Whitehouse. I was wondering, is your husband here?
Well, yes, I'm... I want to say that I'm real sorry about your father, Mrs. Twombley.
Well, yeah, I suppose. Sure. I just had a little business to settle with Mr. Gordon. I'm the local police officer.
Oh, no. No, it's a... it's a traffic thing. No big deal.
Sleeping.
From Wickham's. Been a while. Like some coffee?
We're alright. Your Ma's sleeping. You want me to get her?
Huh?
How was she?
Who?
What happened?
For what?
Jim... for godsake!
Been better, Dad... You?
I'm doing what I can.
Put together a score sheet.  I'll make some calls.
Roger.
Tower, here.
Copy, Air Force One.
Or you will do what, Mrs. Marshall?  But I admire your courage. Your husband, on the other hand...
I know he left you behind.
Your husband is a coward. He sends soldiers half-way around the world to steal a man from his home in the middle of the night.
Pity. Mr. Gibbs.
Tell our boys to cool their jets. I don't need `em creating policy for me.
I should trust that promise? Because you know the voters are still waiting for that middle class tax cut.
You know my policy. We don't negotiate with terrorists. If we start now, all of America becomes a target.
We'll just say it was in bad taste.
DO YOU SEE TEEM?
Dunn.
Ted, I loved you and I'll always love you. But I need Simon.  He's stable.  He's a good provider.  I want that at this stage of the game, Ted.  He might have his faults, but Simon doesn't know the meaning of the word fear and I need that in a man.
Then you <u>do</u> think I'm insane.
What word would you use, Elaine?
What would you say if I told you the toilet just blew up in my face.
There's something dangerously wrong with this ship, Elaine.  I know its the wiring. That toilet's just the tip of the iceberg.
The human brain is a highly complex organ, Elaine, perhaps the most complex next to the bladder.  Let me show you.  Ted's problem is in this area.  This area, this area, here, here, here, under here, here...
Roger.
We'll have to check, Jimmy.  It's a pretty long trip to Mercury.
What should I say?
Kurtz, you're drunk.  Who's in command of this ship?
Then Elaine was right.
Pull yourself together!  We've got to...
Well, to tell the truth, they really didn't fill me in on many of the details. Just told me to pick up Captain Kramer.
I'm not sure. I haven't seen anything like this since the Lina Wertmuller Film Festival.
I won't be back. I've requested the Atlanta run.
Then why don't you take the job that Louie Netz offered you at Boeing?
That's Lieutennt Hurwitz. Severe shell shock. He thinks he's Ethel Merman.
Hello.
Yeah, I think he is.  Hey, Fred!
Hi, Roger. Good to have you aboard. Victor, this is Roger Murdock.
The cockpit? What is it?
Show me.
Sergeant... I'd like to thank you for what you're doing.
I am George.
And that fits?
And still it fits?
From quarantine, when my people first arrived here.  He and I were housed together.
In the camps, we were lodged four to a room.  The selection process was entirely random.  We did not get to stay with our friends... or families...
I appreciate your honesty, George.
Why?
Come on, you won't have to get near the water.
Stay out of this, Matthew.  Tell me where the drug has been taken or I will crush your lungs against this wall.
What is it?
Only holds five.
No... two.
Come on.  You got nothin' better to do, cushy county job like yours.
It is. 
Awright.  Fire-team A.  Gear up. Let's move.  Two minutes. Somebody wake up Hicks.
What?
All right.  Let's get on it.  What'll you need?
They had their minds made up before I even went in there. They think I'm a head case.
Now hold on a second.  I'm not authorizing that action.
Shit.  Apone, collect magazines from everybody.  We can't have any firing in there.
Sir?
Hudson, Sir.  He's Hicks.
Is this going to be a stand-up fight, Sir, on another bug-hunt?
I don't fucking believe this. Do you believe this?
Can't tell.  Lots.  D gun's down to twenty.  Ten.  It's out.
We ain't going anywhere.
Oh, God.  Jesus.  This ain't happening.
They're right on us.  Vasquez, how you doing?
I'm sorry, Newt.
DO you know how to get to the landing field from here?
Then that would be eating and drinking I'd live like a Prince without thinking. The wisdom of old would be mine - A woman's much better than wine! Then that would be eating and drinking! The wisdom of old would be mine - A woman's much better than wine. She's much better than wine! She's much better than wine!
I need to net one birdie only And I will stop feeling so lonely. But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade. I need to net one birdie only But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade.  To a ghost I must fade! To a ghost I must fade!
At present the girls only peck me. Their cruelty surely will wreck me. But one little beak in my own, And I'll up to heaven be flown! At present the girls only peck me. But one little beak in my own, And I'll up to heaven be flown. Up to heaven be flown! Up to heaven be flown!
What??
Go ahead, tell him. Tell them all. They won't understand you anyway.
Because here everything goes backwards. People walk backwards, dance backwards, sing backwards, and talk backwards.
Why? People fart backwards.
Yes, I think it's brilliant. You've been doing it for years.
Wolfi.
These gentlemen are from Salzburg.
Wolfi! Your father is dead.
Your father is dead.
That's right, Your Excellency. I've come on behalf of my hus band. I'm - I'm bringing some samples of his work so he can be considered for the royal appointment.
He's terribly busy, sir.
Your husband is ill, ma'am. He took sick. I brought him home.
I was at hand.
He needs me, ma'am.
He asked me to stay.
Adorable!
Ah, now! Here she comes.
Your Highness.
Because I've already found the most wonderful libretto!
Thank you, Sire!
I will.
But my penalty. I've got to have a penalty.
Yes what?
German!
No, no, I love that. I'd want it to be in German. I haven't done anything in German since Seraglio.
Please. I'll give it back, I promise. Please, sir.
How could I not?
How could it not, Excellency?
I never knew that music like that was possible.
Oh no! One hears such sounds and what can one say, but - Salieri!
The end of the Recordare - Statuens in parte dextra.
Consigned to flames of woe.
What?
Oh, yes.
Come. Let's begin.
Sopranos up to F on the second 'Voca'?
Yes!
Oh yes, certainly. Certainly, Herr Director!
I didn't. That was Mozart. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. You know who that is?
Ah - you've heard that?
And do they believe it?
Do you believe it?
About the ballet.
Excuse me - didn't His Majesty specifically forbid ballet in his opera?
Yes, in the third act.
He didn't say, sir. I told him I didn't know when you would be back, but he insisted on waiting.
Alex, has David persisted in his werewolf fantasies?
Has his friend appeared to him again?
What did he say?
Warn him?
I tried to investigate the attack. There are no records. The case was closed and now they've 'misplaced' the file. David's lacerations were cleaned and dressed when he arrived here and yet supposedly no doctor examined him before I did. The Goodman boy is already in the ground so he's no good to us. So I went to the pub in East Proctor where I was convinced of two things.
They were lying. There were no witnesses, no escaped lunatic. The whole community is hiding the truth of what actually happened up there.
I think the village of East Proctor is hiding some dark and terrible secret. I'm convinced that, like David, they believe in this werewolf.
Shall I be forced to feed you, David?
Right.
Charming.
Lovely.
There is only one bed.
I should be committed.
I don't know why I feel so good. I haven't felt this good in a long time.
No.
No.
Quiet, everyone! Hush! Shhh!
Sure, as a kid. But never so real. Never so bizarre.
It's a five-pointed star.
Yeah?
There aren't any coyotes in England.
Pecos Bill.
Heathcliffe didn't howl.
It's a full moon, 'beware the moon'.
Yeah.
I'll tell you when we get there.
Hello.
Campari and soda would do nicely.
I suppose Guinness will suffice.
Listen, I told you I wasn't interested in that deal, didn't I?
I'm fourteen cents out, and it took me half an hour to find the mistake. And me with a date, too.
Yeah.
I know, Dickson. That's all very well. But you're taking too many chances. In these times a bank should keep liquid in case of trouble. In case of emergency!
Somebody must be in good humor. He was humming "Mother Machree."
Why not?
You don't have to do nothing.
Don't you know I've been crazy about you for years?
I've loved you ever since I can remember, long before you married Tom Dickson.
No. No, I'm not. I deliberately avoided you. I was afraid of making a fool of myself. But I won't stand it any longer
This is my business. Mr. Dickson's been like a father to me.  What has he ever done to you to deserve a deal like this?
I guess I have said enough  I'm just wasting my breath talking to you.
Happy now?
Helen, I'm going to Philadelphia, just as soon as the bank closes. Make all the arrangements, will you?
Sure, I think it's swell.
Good.  You've got nothing to worry about. Soon as the report comes in, you'll be released.  And listen, don't talk so loud. Take it easy. Coast a little.
Yes, sir.
Oh, is that so?
Don't cry, honey. Everything's gonna be all right.
That's all, Mrs. Halligan. Thanks.
I said like a Comanche, not this Comanche.
Better pass them over here before something happens to 'em.
I can hit those boys from here. We just need a distraction.
Exactly.
What's going on?
So what do we do, General Lee?
If you'd read about it first, you'd have no problems.
I've robbed just as many banks as you have! I know this town, and I know this bank, and I say it's an easy job.
Pff. All we been through, the thought never crossed my mind.
Get buckets!
What is it?
So?
I'm upset too, Zee, but Jesse and Cole know what they're doing. I'm sure they won't press their luck.
You can shut up now.
I swear I'll shoot you in your sleep.
And that's why you both lead the gang. Two of you went into that bank together, right?
See you soon. Oh, and I appreciate the distraction back there.
Shush.
Jesse. What are you thinking? There are bounty hunters and lawmen all over this county!
Pity.
No.
It's not my job to relax. I've put men facing out both ways down Main Street, so nobody can ride in shooting. I've got a sharpshooter up on the water tower just in case.
Sir?
What, sir?
I demand action.
Can't you tell me anything?
Turn the light on.
Actually, that's none of your business, Christie, hut I can assure you it certainly wasn't cheap.
My need to engage in homicidal behavior on a massive scale cannot be, um, corrected, but I have no other way to fulfill my needs.
How did you guess?
Thanks, guy, but...she's got a lousy personality.
What exactly do you mean?
It looks that way, doesn't it?
Ask me a question.
Yes, sir.
Let's not think about what I want. How about anywhere you want.
No, come on. Anywhere you want.
Come on. Where do you want to go? Anywhere you want. Just say it. I can get us in anywhere.
I know I should go. I know I have a tendency to get involved with unavailable men, and...I mean, do you want me to go?
Oh yeah. Oh I get it. Fun with chocolate.
No, I'm sorry. I should've made an appointment.  Was that anything important?
I'm...at a loss. He was part of that whole...Yale thing, you know.
Dan, great to see you again. Like I said, you need anything at all, I'm your man. I don't envy your job. I mean Owen was a...complex man.
It's cold out, too, isn't it?
Why don't you get a job? If you're so hungry, why don't you get a job?
Why? Were you drinking? Is that why you lost it? Insider trading? Just joking. No, really-were you drinking on the job?
Yes, Owen?
No, Owen.
Yes, it is.
If he's really a bully, he won't cop to it, anyway.
Teddy was killed last night.
It was a hate crime.
I went to see the Skywire model in Gary's office. You know. Just to hold it again.
...It's -- Milo, isn't it?
Give me two seconds with Lacy here?  Go on in, I won't be a moment.
Is it your dish?
There's a rumor going around, maybe you've heard it.
Well -- you sent for me.
...Worse?
Don't be so hard on yourself. With a brain like yours, you could connive with the best of 'em I bet.
Gary, don't worry, we --
Let's get him in here.
"There is no second place." Plus every time I get jammed-up, Gary has an inspiration.  Is it like that with your counselor?
Right, right. But does he ever just, like, hand you code?
You're compulsive.
Why's that?
Right. But Gary's tied-in to a lot of media conglomerates. Have to be careful who we pick.
Certainly not at my happy home.
The dishes are juiced up, too.
Milo? Shrot suspects somebody broke into #21. I was in his office when he was reviewing the card readouts.
He doesn't know about the Day Care.
Yeah, that's old, in a tree.
Milo? What if Shrot notices somebody entered the Day Care at four A.M.? And tells them about it?
Outpost made me sign 1,000. 'Guess we'll find out what else we have to talk about. Life stuff.
Not much. Glorified cherry bomb. Right by the civil defense sign? Some geek's idea of irony. I been saying we need a camera in this hall.
Unless it's a diversion. Milo's in my office. He was tailgating, so I --
Is it about my teeth?
Damn. What exactly do you do at Virtucon?
I think it was Wordsworth who penned this little gem: 'Press the button, pull the chain, out comes a chocolate choo-choo train.'
Right away, Exposition.
Hey, Mick!
Well, you can't always get what you want.
Good on ya, man.
Sure.
What?
I hope this is part of the unfreezing process.
I understand that, Mr. Powers, but let me be perfectly clear with you, perhaps to the point of being insulting. I will never have sex with you, ever.  If you were the last man on Earth and I was the last woman on Earth, and the future of the human race depended on our having sex simply for procreation, I still would not have sex with you.
How do you know?
Of course, luv.
Don't be sorry. You're right to be suspicious. I shagged her. I shagged her rotten.
Of course, I had my nine-millimeter automatic.
Only sailors use condoms, man.
Well they should, filthy beggars, they go from port to port.  Alotta meant nothing to me.
It was just a shag, Vanessa. You're everything to me.
Likewise.
I believe you, Austin. Let's go.
Where did you learn to shoot?
Yes.
My son?
Not me.
All right then...  ...FIVE MILLION DOLLARS!
OK, Scott, no one really wants to "kill" anyone here. They say it, but they don't mean it.
Out in India. So character-forming for the British. Not the heat. Good Lord, no. The rain, dash it. A good monsoon. Fifteen inches overnight. A whole week of lovely rain. I remember one summer in Jaipur ...
Hmmm ...
Quite frankly ... it could have been you.
Destruction of their local weather systems. I can zap a thousand Chernobyls into the air.
Chaos. Transport paralysis. Crop failure.  Economic disaster. Frostbite or sunburn ... on a massive scale. You've seen a few samples...
One very small thing. A diamond 'cyclone' chip. A thousand times more information on a fraction of the size. If I possess that, my powers would be unlimited. My dear half-brother was developing it. But he suspected sabotage. He gave the chip to ... you, 'Mrs.' Peel. I want you. But also your ring.
Thank you, Trubshaw ...
Did you say formal? I must dress.
Have I trespassed on a male prerogative?  We're being followed. I saw him at Trubshaw's ...
Not for a moment.
Aren't we all, Mrs. Peel?
I thought you didn't.
Winning isn't everything.
After you -- Mrs. Peel ...
Limpet bomb. Small, very compact. From Trubshaw's.
You first.
I'm no spy -- where do I fit in?
... and now?
She may not know. Theory goes she may be very ill.
Possibly. Split personality ...
Who knows? If Dr. Darling is right, you should watch out.
She may try to kill you.
Both, actually.
You don't say.  Like looking for a needle in a ...
Debbie's marrying Rick.
You're kidding.
I'd like to jerk and press those babies.
Maybe it had something to do.
Well, tell the asshole to shut up.
Sorry, I can't hear you. Some pin head's yelling...  Shut up, I'm talking here.  Now look, I want you to go back and I don't care what you do. Stop that marriage.
You better not have too much joy.
Gonna get married...
Yeah.
You're so romantic...
A real turd.
Isn't he incredible, gets along with everybody.
Larry, you and your wife got problems?
This is the Park View Hotel. I'm the Hotel Manager. Are you looking for someone?
No. Let's at least finish the set.
This isn't right.
Take care.
Nah, not yet. Look, you're my older brother. I need some advice here. What's the deal with marriage? What can I expect?
Thanks, Stan, you've been a lot of help.
Yeah...
Just come down, John. Just --
Thanks for the speakers.
This?
Saw what?
Everybody did.
...Jesus, you been carrying that around for twenty years? For christ's sake, you were seven years old! You think he could have heard you in there?
Maybe I do.  ...What a fuckin' mess, huh?  People can change Brian.
Carrying Swayzak's notebook?
Yeah. Swayzak. Humanity's last hope. How can you work for that guy?
-- All I know is that his programs are getting firemen hurt.
Homey.
Do you miss it?  You seem like you do.
Then why did you quit?
What?
I... I thought it was great. I loved it. It was nothing to these guys... medium deal.
-- I wanted to be him. Right then I wanted to be him more than anything...
The outlets.
Trychticholorate.
No it couldn't.
Yeah? Airtight?
You guys ought to try picking up a phone once in awhile.
There's no replacement 'cause of your boss' cuts, if that's what you mean. If someone else goes out on an injury we're really screwed.
Stephen, I'm kinda busy here, can we talk about this later?
Trychticholorate? Alright, it's an absorption catalyst in toxic waste accidents. It's pretty rare, they stopped making it a couple'a years ago.
What the hell was it doing in the fire?
Alderman.
I'm not talking about the fucking Church. Fuck the Church. But tell me. Do you believe in God?
That Jesus Christ was the Son of God and he came to die for your sins.
Yes.
Yes.
All right, cop. I want my money.
What about the money you owe me on yesterday's game?
Let me think about it.
What case?
Yeah. Sure. Yeah. We're on it bigtime. Lots of leads. You bet.
We know.  We know.  Yo, check it, my black brothers, we can't let this slide.  Not this injustice. Nah, no way.  Dem' two real coons iz ill.
So are you telling me that you wouldn't even introduce me to Delacroix or set up a meeting?  I'm talking 'bout me, your only brother, ya own flesh and blood, hook a brother up, youknowwhatI'msayin'.
There is a name, a term for your kind, the likes of you.  Back in slavery days, you would be classified as a house nigga.
My own sister throwin' me out.  I hope to seeya later when you get ya mind right.  Don't bother letting me out.
Must be the pressure.
We might need some mo' money behind this.
To what?
Mantan?  I don't even care as long as I'm dancing.  Which reminds me, I need some new kicks.
I don't agree.  The Negro middle class does exist, and it's rich material for a dramatic series or sitcom.
Let'em try.  I will kill to make this happen.
We just punched it up a bit.  Made it funnier.
I seriously doubt that will ever happen.  Didn't I tell you I know your people better than you do. But if by some miracle you're correct, I'm gonna invite them inside my house and we'll have a sit down, discuss it like civil human beings.
Nuthin' I can't handle.
Where do you go from here?
I didn't mean that, in life.
Do you know how you will use him?
Break a leg.
Light?
You can talk all that mumbo jumbo if you want to but your hands are much bloody.  I know where I made my big mistake.  I have a general rule, never get involved romantically with somebody crazier than you.
Naw.  I'll take the zero.
I feel fine.
Sloan, will you take your boss out of here so I can get ready.
I'll be right over.
The best defense is offense.
You tellin' the truth.
Enough.
If you're insulted, and not satisfied, remember there's two of us, Best.
Your loyalty to me and your service to the regiment has pleased me very well -- and now there is another occasion on which you may make yourself useful to us; if you succeed, depend on it, your reward will be your discharge from the army, and a bounty of 100 guineas.
There is lately come to Berlin a gentleman in the service of the Empress Queen, who calls himself the Chevalier de Belle Fast, and wears the red riband and star of the pope's order of the Spur.  He is made for good society, polished, obliging, a libertine, without prejudices, fond of women, of good food, of high play, prudent and discreet.
Oh, it's with pistols we fight.  You are no match for Best with the sword.
But swords are today impossible; Captain Best is -- is lame.  He knocked his knee against the swinging park gate last night, as he was riding home, and can scarce move it now.
It must have been some other gate.
Yes, sir.  Here is my letter.
It is my only object.
To love you until death.  To subscribe to all your commands.
Deceiving someone without knowing it is something new for me.  If I do not know it, I am innocent.
With pleasure at finding the ribbon.
The Prince left him only that choice.
Good night, my little darling.
Yes?
What the devil?  What kind of fools do we have here?  Pottle, who told the lad this story?
It's ten thirty in the morning.
You know the law -- no liquor before noon. Could lose my license.
None of that matters now. We got two dead bodies and a story that explains them. You're either with us, or against us -- which is it?
Shut up.  West's dead.
That son of a bitch.
He's lying.
I'm serious --
Do what?
Would you have believed me?
West... he's dead.
If not you, then who?
Oh, come on --
That's exactly what he says about you.
Levi, you got about four hours before armed men show up here, put you on a plane to Washington, and lock you in a very small dark room. I suggest you talk to us.
My heart weeps.
I don't know --
Maybe --
Maybe he...
Who killed Pike?
What are you talking about?
You're drunk --
Ten bucks says I have him talking in under three minutes.
Got it.
Oh, spare me the reverse psychology bullshit! This isn't my "great second chance", Osborne. Everyone thinks I'm a piece of shit cop who took money and nothing is going to change that. Nobody will ever know what happens here --
Now I go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.
Nah.
This is the perfect time. You know what makes a good detective? The number of confessions they get. You're a good detective, Osborne. So now you get mine.
Tough.
Although that won't matter much when coupled with the murder charge --
We've been making progress, I see.
I scared Dunbar into silence. He's been trying to cover for me the whole time. We got here, you came to see me... I didn't know if I could trust him with that kind of secret --
-- failure to comply with this arrest is a court martialable offense in and of itself --
Gets on his plane in ten minutes, which means you two are done. You'll understand if I don't walk you out.
A few rabbits, but I think one of them was already dead.
I'll go in right now and get that eye.
Fine, I will.
Fine, I'm doing it.
Eighteen.
You're pretty good at arithmetic.
Please. Go. Just go.
Go.
Truth is, I've been thirsty my whole life. Never really known why.
Your mom says I can't tell you that one anymore. You get nightmares.
Yes.
You say...
Really.
Because he's dying.
You don't have to.
He's impossible. He won't eat. And because he won't eat, he gets weaker. And because he's weaker, he doesn't want to eat.
You don't talk about those things. Not yet.
Yes?
It's nothing. I burnt myself.
It is. I did it cooking.
I'm asking what you're here for.
What?
I'll give him money. Tell him to put the...
I'll fuckin' give it to him! We'll go down there.
I've got eight hundred pounds. Oh Jesus.
Happy bath day.
I don't have any money.
Get out
Get out.
It's alright.
Sophia. Hello Sophia. Mine's still John.
Well. Hope you enjoy it.
That young lady's size, right'cher.
It's not her fault, Gill. She's had to take care of me all this time, cuz I'd just start throwin' up... choking. Just losin' my grip. And she listened. She listened to me.  And... I got better. I don't get nervous like I used to. And since we been together... she been faithful to me. Put all that junk behind her...
Yeah.
Son, I'm grown. Don't got patience to suffer you children and this monkey junk. I'm too old to play house...  ...and cowboys. So let's have it. End me or get out of my face!
I'm right enough to stand on my own two feet. Now take this Goddamn chain off...
What?
Do me? Do me like this, you mean? Like chainin' me up?
The hell you know about me?! You got no right to talk to me about that shit! The hell you think you are?
Itches.
Uh-uh.
I'm here with you.
Looks like you know a song.
Like I told you.
You mean with you and that woman chained to ya radiator?
One thing at a time, Laz.
Naw... I got it, Mr. Lazarus.  You wanna tip me, best do it in butter beans. Momma say she need a bag 'a yours, none of that store-bought junk. That's what she said.
Yeah?
Thought you had a man for that.
What we just did, you askin' for money, make a man stop. I ain't callin' you no ho. But I ain't gonna be played like no trick, neither. Remember... you called me.
What'd I tell you?  I don't do none of that shit no more. I'm in communications now.
-- I should tear your head off.
-- Hey, I got a better chance of being hit by a bus then moving up.
Number five with a bullet.
He couldn't find his ass with both hands.
The mayor's office, under the bed, the back room at Lombardi's.  And call me Ich.
We can ask someone I used to work with.  A criminal.  Someone I pay money to...
Good.  Very good...
For Sugai.  Caviar, French cheese, ham... If you come to apologize for interrupting his meeting, Sugai may feel obligated to see you.
Why's that?
He's on duty.
What if I chant?
What...?  What if I say no?
Why me?
For God's sake, Ohashi, I need your help.  Let me out of here!
If anything happens to her while I'm here --
I have to get to Sugai.
You certainly have a nice place here.
Why?
What about E.M.S. recombination?
You mean that you can't come here and I can't go there?
Of course not.
I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy.  I wish I did, but you're out of my league.
Five.  Three nights ago one of them managed to break into the Tyrell Corporation.  Killed two guards and got as far as the Genetic Sector before he got fried going through an electro- field.
There wasn't much left of him, so we can't be sure.  But bio- chemical data and morphology records of the Nexus-6 were reported missing.  Going on the possibility they might try to infiltrate we send Holden in to run Voight-Kampff tests on the new employees.  Guess he found himself one.
Your customer, eh?
Sorry, don't have the time.
I'm taking a piss.
What did she want?
The girl that doesn't look like that girl.
What night?
What's suck night?
You talking about the Opera House on the Main?
A humanoid robot is like any other machine, it can be a benefit or a hazard.  If it's a benefit, it's not our problem.
So?
Yeah.  Sometimes.
What difference will it make?
Five, maybe six.
I was tired and didn't have any place to go.
What's that?
Is that why you're still here?
Come where?
For how long?
I thank you very much for the invitation, but I'm quite busy today. Perhaps I could see you tomorrow.
No, you get out of here.
Yes.
Yes.
Heck, no!  What?!
Can't you please just talk to me for one second?
It's your life.  And, by the way, it's a dandy.
No problem.  We'll just sell another baseball card.
Thank-Q!
Well, I know Mom sure likes 'em!
Have you ever heard the saying, "He hasn't got enough sense to come in out of the rain?"
Yeah? No kidding. Listen, you still want to go girl hunting tonight?
Okay. But you know, this business of finding you a wife -- it's kind of ridiculous, don't you think?
Yes it is. A girlfriend maybe. But a wife? I mean...
Hey, screw you! Okay? You think I'm just somebody you can buy off! Listen, let me tell you something--
Well...yeah. Okay.
Okay. All right.  And what do I say?
No.
Archbishop Melker. We met earlier.
Yes, father?! Yes?
Yes, sir.  Is that all?
1959.
Russia.
1867.  Seward's Folly. We paid 7.2 million dollars for it. A tidy sum then, as well as now. I'm quoting my father, of course.
Juneau.
Sorry, that's the largest city.
How 'bout we check with Eve first?
So, did you buy a movie?
A magazine?  A toy perhaps?  In the bookstore.
I know what you mean!  I usually wear a big hat and dark glasses.
Yeah...Seems to.
Hi.
Yes, ma'am.
Well, he and Mrs. Nutcase must have been out here when the plane hit.
What about relatives?
The neighbors over there said the guy spent day and night out here. She'd bring him sandwiches and hot Dr. Pepper.
Yeah.
Yeah.
To you maybe.
Right here!
Oh, I was just examining this rear hatchway.
No reason.  Well, it's pretty clear that the front entrance caved in when the bomb went off. So, you know, when the time is up, we'll have to return to the surface using, you know, this back entrance.  Which is very nice because it has the service elevator!
Yes.  Well... yes.
Yeah. Let's dig in!
Amen.
Out-of-town.  That's all he'll say.
Always good advice.
Coward!
You bet, Mom! Coming up!
I'm not sick.
Got it. Thanks for letting me in on as much as you did.
Yes sir.
Nothing. Are you alright?
I'll go then.
I, uh.
That's not crazy. I like you too.
I'm doing it.
Whatiya mean?
What do you want?
No. I told you. I don't want to hurt you. I want to help you. I think I know some of what is happening to you.  Dorothy? Frank has your husband and son. Dorothy? Doesn't he? You have to do something Dorothy. Go to the police.
No.  Hi baby.
Come on, Frank. Let's go. Please.
Yes.
Oh, yes, Jeffrey. Come in. He'll be back any minute now. You're welcome to wait. Is it urgent?
Really, he'll be home soon, would you like a cup of coffee?
Hey Jeff.
I guess so. Like you said. It's a strange world.
First of all, we'll have a nice dinner. Try to find out where Dorothy sings.
Great. I'll pick you up around eight o'clock. Is that good?
Okay. You better get out before someone sees us.
I will. I'll pick you up on the same corner at three thirty-five, okay?
Nothing, really! It's good to see you.
Where to?
I'd rather not talk about it. I'll tell you about it sometime.
You look beautiful.
I like that idea, that's a real good idea.
Yeah. I just saw him outside. Maybe the robins are here.
Go find one.
Let's do him right here.
Oh, what the fuck? How do you guys decide who you're... I mean, who makes the cut? Is there a raffle or something?
Okay, just calm down. He could hurt us, brother. He could ruin the whole thing.
You won't do it Connor, you won't. You love me man.
Well, there's my boys.  Shit. I gotta go. Looks like I caused a ruckus with that shot. Half the damn neighborhood is comin'.
Aye.
Italian.
Aye.
Yeah, and ya gotta shoot at him for ten minutes.
Yes, we are.
He's a good man.
Nah, too quick half their infrastructure got taken out at the Copley plaza. Besides, if you're a hitter, you're either working for the Russians or the Italians. There's no riding the fence. Our little theory from last night just got blown to shit. Something... new is going on here.
What about one guy with two guns?
It tells us that he was the last to die. All these men  Were carrying. They came in, dropped all in seconds and then took their time with fag man. Didn't they, Duffy?!  They sure as fuck did!
Don't kill me. Oh shit, please no. I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man!... the funny man... the funny.
Y'know it is, a bit.
Y-Yes my son.
Just go!
See, your mind is very good with the more mechanical details. Whereas my strength would be --
Yeah.
Oh, shit. That was scary. In the middle of the robbery. The manager looks at me. Right in the eye. And goes, I'm going to remember you.
Then you're going to have to dye it, Anthony. We've got to hide our identities. Especially after Bob crashed the car.
This was in fourth grade.
After that my parents never let me go to Dignan's again.
Would of been nice.
You really hit a guy with a bottle?
What the fuck are we doing out here?
I'm sorry, Bob.
Any activity?
Good. It's supposed to be.
Stand by, Bird Dog.
I'll see you there.
I'll see you there.
I'll get him.
Yes, there is. Let's get organized.
What can I say? It's jail. You don't sleep when you want to. You don't eat when you want to.
Yeah. Convert it into lofts. OK. Pop quiz. What's the single most important aspect of your job?
Me?
I don't want to die.
Yeah. I mean, I don't think about it all the time. But once in awhile I kind of go, Woah. Man.
Death.
No. Bob did.
Are you afraid to die, Mr. Henry?
Yeah. He said that.
Is that OK?
No, I'm having a heart attack. Of course, I'm OK. What's that supposed to mean?
God, yes. Like silk.
We're going too slow. It looks like we're following him.
Yes. I did.
It's true, Dignan.
I'll just drive my car.
God DAMMIT.
I told you they were there.
Well, obviously, we got to go back.
Dignan, he's my brother. I can't just leave him there.
Come on, Dignan.
I'm going back.
Watch me.
I don't want to fight you, Dignan.
I didn't think there was an alarm.
Hey, Jackson. How's it going?
We're just going over a few things.
Si. Tecate. You like to fight?
Fight. You know.
Never heard of it.
With all due respect, Pam, I think you might've wandered a little past your pay-grade.
I'd rather stand if it's all the same to you.
'Why' would be enough for me.
And pocketed a fair amount of change while doing it.
And Danny Zorn, what was that?
No good options left?
No. You lost your way.
You killed them.
Shot dead in Paris. Dead the night you walked out.
He was at the campground yesterday.
It's wrong. Guy with a rental car and hundred dollar sneakers sleeps in a tent?
Yes.
I want to come in.
Who's going? Us?
Then get a number, they need to know who they're dealing with.
That's where we came out.
We're talking raw, unprocessed KGB files. It's not something we can go out and comparison shop.
For a thief. A mole. I vetted the source, Marty. He's real. If it does nothing more than narrow the list of suspects, it's a bargain at ten times the price.
I don't know. He was sick. He wanted out. I believed him.
Saying goodbye in their own way -- in outlawed tartans, with outlawed pipes, playing outlawed tunes.
He will. I know he will.
Look at me. I said LOOK AT ME!
Aye.
I will not.
Let her speak.
...I wouldn't know.
Sir, I... come to beg you to confess all, and swear allegiance to the king, that he might show you mercy.
Mercy... is to die quickly. Perhaps even live in the Tower. In time, who knows what can happen, if you can only live.
I'm sorry, but can it wait til tonight? I'm already late for work --
Thanks. Don't worry Evan, you'll have plenty of time.
No, it's just weird with him being such a brain and all, I just wondered if he was ever able to remember stuff he'd forgotten.
Can you protect me?
Are you sure? Not even with my father?
Huh?
Hi, Lenny.
As if my dad could've stopped me from seeing you. What's he gonna do to me?
I get it. You can drop it now.
No. Just that you need to hurt me with it. I've been where you've been.
The bottom. When you're just a piece of meat waiting for the next attack.
That's right, Evan, and you get to be the star.
But it didn't. And now I need info to make things right again and you're the only one who can give it to me.
Who's to say you can't make things better?
Yeah. I've been keeping journals since I was seven.
Duly noted. Now I'm gonna ask you for one last favor.
Shhh. I need to concentrate on the blockbuster if I'm gonna destroy it.
If I hadn't blown my arms off, Mom never woulda started smoking in the first place. Now shhhh.
I think I'll go check out the chapel.
Yes?
I'm sorry. It is.
Well, I'll get it from the safe.
-- Forget it, Emil. Mistakes like that happen all the time.
Oh, by the way, my agreement with Sam's always been that he gets twenty- five percent of the profits. That still goes.
And Abdul and Carl and Sacha, they stay with the place, or I don't sell.
Well, so long.
This morning you implied it was not safe for him to leave Casablanca.
Occupied France?
What value is that? You may recall what German guarantees have been worth in the past.
What are they?
And the other alternative?
No, no, no, no. We must leave.
-- The train for Marseilles leaves at five o'clock. I'll pick you up at your hotel at four-thirty.
All right. At a quarter to five.  Say, why don't we get married in Marseilles?
Richard, I had to see you.
Please.
You can ask any price you want, but you must give me those letters.
I know how you feel about me, but I'm asking you to put your feelings aside for something more important.
It was your cause, too. In your own way, you were fighting for the same thing.
No.
But what about us?
And I said I would never leave you.
Goodnight.
He suggested I ask you.
Yes. He said, "Ask your wife." I don't know why he said that.
You're saying this only to make me go.
Thank you.
Yes, rather.
Very well.
You were a Czechoslovakian. Now you are a subject of the German Reich!
Good evening, Captain.
If Rick has the letters, he's much too smart to let you find them there.
But we mustn't underestimate American blundering. I was with them when they "blundered" into Berlin in 1918.
Why? What's in Lisbon?
Excuse me.
I am shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on in here!
You think of everything, don't you?
There seems to be no secret about that.
It's not particularly my beloved Paris.
For how long?
I don't want them here overnight.
Six kilometers.  Four miles.
I'm putting it off.
I'm serious.  I'm always going on about me, me, me.  Enough about me.  Your turn.
Shut up.
He was a sorry sonofabitch, and I'm sorry I ever married him.
Cold.
I thought I did.
We're a little emotional here.  It's Christmas, maybe we're over-reacting.
Could you watch Jango?
I can't take him to work.
Is that Jango?
It means a lot...that you came.
You bet I do.  High tide comes right up to this road.
That new roof, that's your doing.
Who is this?  Where is Kamal?
What's going on down there?
Who's in charge then, where is Chinn?
Stan, it's Chuck...Chuck Noland...
Hallelujah.
It claims to restore monthly regularity.
Dr. Homer Wells.
Daddy, *please*...
Okay...
It was my favorite night at the orphanage--movie night. We'd race into the dining hall. Of course everyone wanted to sit in front, so we'd be packed in so tight you could feel the kid next to you breathing.
I didn't say that. Growing up in an orphanage, you're always lonely. You're just never alone.
I told her! She doesn't feel she can do that. Something about her father not letting her go anywhere...
Sure. Thanks.
I never said they were boring.
Well, they aren't.
He's leaving...
Why can't we have pumpkins for Christmas, too? We don't get any good presents at Christmas, anyway.
I've got thirty-five minutes to climb to fifteen thousand feet--that's the first mountain pass.
Homer, you the only one who's read them rules, so you the only one who feels like he's doin' somethin' wrong.
When it comes to this, you is the real thing--is that what you sayin'?
Nobody's named this one yet.
You know everything I know, plus what you've taught yourself--you're a better doctor then I am and you know it!
So what?
Now, now. He's a good boy.
Jack, you gotta watch your language 'round my daughter.
Mind your own business, Peaches.
That's right. I know you understand how I feel, Homer--you is breakin' them rules, too. Ain't that right?
She took off in the night!
I envy you guys. Taking a chance like that.
It's Alfonse. I want to settle up. I haven't been ducking you. I told you I'd get it.
We got our stake. Now we need to find our guy in Gillett's bank.
Fine. But only if we recover the cash.
It's alright. Grant's one of the good guys.
Yes, her. Where's my wallet?
Eight A.M. flight.
We'll use the Euc.
I think two million.
I need you to stake me.
I need you to stake me. I can't do it without it. It's just a couple hundred grand. Taken out of our cut when we're done.
Gunther? I think I'd remember a Gunther.
Listen to me! It went to shit. It happens sometimes.
You get an equal cut.
Just play a part. A little acting.
For what? A couple hundred bucks?
It's what I do. It's my job.
Are you asking me if I have something to prove?
Not in that repressed anger sort of way.
Good quality porn has it's place in the world.
I'm good at it. Lying, cheating, manipulating... I'm good at it.
Intuition. It doesn't make you Yoda. Like tonight. You killed that guy tonight. But I knew you would.
No. You have another part? You'll know what to do.
Intuition.
No, I'm not going to take it easy. You can't stay clear of this guy. He will be on this until the end of time.
You better get over to Al's. Now.
Yeah, or D, it's a dumb fucking idea...
We never had a problem with that before.
What are you talking about? Yes we have. And we would have been beautiful about it. We would've had a bucket of chicken delivered to the King with a nice kiss my ass card attached to it. Then we woulda moved on 'til the next local putz caught on.
Yeah, well we're still a little young for Albany State Prison. Are you pissed about Al? I'm pissed too, but I'm not like "twenty-five to life" pissed.
Do you have a ticket?
Keep it up.
Can't do it Suits. I can't lay down for this one.
I want him for something big and to do that, we have to catch him in the act.
It's cosmetic. They don't cover cosmetic. Last year I had a tooth capped. The dentist tells me I'm not covered for caps. It's cosmetic.
Look, now I'm pumping you. I'm sorry. It's none of my business. It's just that you're not like the others.
Now he's a real shit. Don't get friendly with him. I'm sure he's got his hand in the till. You know what he said to me once? "I want to fuck the whole world over. That's my mission." The shit!
I'm working on that soccer story.
Habib?
It's not just inner beauty, is it?
I'll see you in my dreams.
Never. Why do you ask?
Gambling's not about money.
Gambling's about not facing reality. Ignoring the odds.
Well, thank you anyway.
What kind of trouble?
Was that why you did the two grand? I couldn't help you.
I don't have any money.  switches on the light. JANI is looking distressed.
Yes.
Too much. Eighteen hundred.
No thanks.
I don't gamble.
I was at Beadles.
What for?
I don't gamble.
I don't gamble, Mr Reynolds.
Bruised.
Doolittle, are you there?
Energy shielding positive function.
Detonation in six minutes, twenty seconds.
Check at six minutes.
Of course.
I am always receptive to suggestions.
Commander Powell is dead.
I'm getting something here, on this readout...
I think I'm getting a malfunction here somewhere.
Lieutenant Doolittle, I'm getting a definite malfunction on one of the closed-circuit computer systems...
I can't seem to locate the malfunction exactly...
...Somewhere in the autonomic relay circuits...
Doolittle, hello?
Sorry.
Ah... it seems to me, Doolittle... Sorry, I've drawn a blank. Hold it. I'll have it again in a minute. I forget so many things in here, so many things. Hold on, just a minute, let me think...
Sooo...whattya think?  Maybe after I betray the woman who trusts me and you take her and her daughter out and execute them...we could go on a date.  Play a little miniature golf or somethin'.
Where?
No way.
Thanks, it's starting to kick in.  I feel almost human.
If I'm sad, or tired, or sometimes when I'm angry or when somebody's being mean to me.
Then I'm gonna do what you do to make me feel better when I'm sad.
I won't be staying.
Like extra virgin olive oil, the best of the best.
I need to find this technician, or anyone else who knows about Project Manticore. They would've used surrogate mothers to carry you after the in-vitro work... If I can track down one of them.
Your help.
The woman you met, Lauren.  She supervised workers removing cortodiazapine from gel caps by hand and replacing it with powdered sugar.  The real drug was shipped out of the country. The placebos were distributed to County VA Hospital and six veterans' clinics in the area.
She's prepared to testify that she was instructed to do this by one of Edgar Sonrisa's managers.  You know who Sonrisa is?
So, you know the lengths he'll go to keep her from going public... I'm turning Lauren over to Canadian law enforcement tomorrow.  They'll put her in witness protection, but if you're with her the risk of her safety goes way down.
She's put her life on the line, and her faith in me.
You don't want to.
She may be easy on the eyes but she's trouble, trust me.  Hot run to two-oh-two Sansomme.
Can't help you.
Then what?
Nothing on Hannah?
Caught some son-of-a-bitch stealing my bike.  Used a car jack to blow out my U lock and bent a bunch of spokes.  So now I gotta get my wheels fixed.
No, but I broke a nail giving him a cranium crack and that just sort of wrecks your day, know what I'm saying?
Pull the cash.
Not half as pissed as she's gonna be when she finds out why I blew her off... I need your help, Max.
You're too kind. I'm Amanda.
Don't be so glum, Hawk. The night's still young and filled with plenty of compensatory possibilities.
I'd be in a position to spend some money on you if you'd get in a position and spend some time on me.
You're not gonna chicken out on me now, are you? We've got your KISS song playing and everything.
Look, people undress in public because, A, they're exhibitionists, B, they're nutcases, or C, they need the money. I can tell you're not A, and I hope to hell you're not B. So my suggestion is, think about why you're a C and let your body party, shake your groove thing, boogie oogie oogie till you just can't boogie no more.
Nah. Once I get my own wheels, I could come up all the time.
Just for the record, I understood the last part of what you said, but for a while there you guys were making no fucking sense whatsoever.
YO, DOOFUS!
Gimme a second, dudes. Lemme think.
Hey, disco dude, it's cool...
I'm really sorry about that, man.
Of course, but has that ever stopped me before? Besides, my mom's going to some church meeting and won't be back till late. No sweat... See you guys in school.
Jam, not another word out of your femmy-ass mouth! Okay, we're here, we got nothing, and we got an hour and a half. We're totally committed. It's time to brainstorm.
Just keep your lying, heathenous trap shut, Jeremiah.
Shrooms! And even if it was LSD, I can still give my mom a kiss without smelling the catch of the day.
Hello summer detention.
Say, Chongo, perhaps we could use some extra cash for tasty snacks at the KISS concert our weasly friend won't be attending.
Yeah.
I didn't say shit.
Well, if you're innocent, then you have nothing to worry about.
Sure.
So when you sleepwalk, you go somewhere familiar?
And you'd never been there before?
Infant Memory Generators.
And inside these glasses are these slide photographs. And each photograph is of something peaceful... or beautiful. Whatever pictures the parent wants to put inside.
Yeah...
It was great. We had peanut-butter sandwiches and apples and honey at snacktime. And then during show-and- tell, my stuffed walrus was a big hit.
Do they know yet?
Where it came from?
So we're not supposed to tell anybody what nobody knows?
A famous linguist once said... that of all the phrases in the English language, of all the endless combinations of words in all of history... that "Cellar Door" is the most beautiful.
It was just like she described them in her book. Like they were alive. The way that they looked... moved... smelled. They were like workers... assigned to each one of us.  I followed my spear... and I found something...
Maybe you'd like to tell Mom and Dad why you stopped taking your medication.
But let me remind you that this treatment is... experimental.
Yep.
I guess they made him do it.
Raspberry.
Thank God for bunge cords.
Oh, yeah, sure. You know, every pageant is special, but this one is extra-special to me. When I was seventeen, I don't know if you know this, but I was crowned Mount Rose's American Teen Princess. And this year... drum roll please, my lovely daughter, Rebecca Ann Leeman is competin'.
Would yous boys excuse us a second? Loretta, you too.
I just did.
Yah-sure, fine... fine.
Bye.
She's the winner and we're going to state.
Sammy Davis, Jr., honey.
"Proud... to be... an... American."
No! We not like to hear it! Go to your room and shut up!
What, you deaf? I say shut up -- shut up -- SHUT UP!  Cut her outta this!
None of your business...  Take another letter.
That's a-no good.  You gotta insult somebody from another country.  Look --  I come from one country.  You come from another country.  I say something you don't like.  You say something I don't like - and I'm insulted.
You was insulted, but you don't know it.
That's a-no good.  If I apologize we no got a war.  Look -- I send you a scrap of paper.  You send me a scrap of paper -- and we have a scrap.
He's-a very easy to insult --  I say something to his niece once, and he slapped my face.
She did.
That's-a pretty good.  I'll take a dozen of them.
Yes, one gross of bullets, two dozen hand-grenades, three kegs of powder -- and throw in some matches.
Fine.  We gotta him. 
Sure.
I bring you the greetings of my President and the good will of my people.
Twenty million dollars is a considerable sum...  I'll have to discuss that with my Minister of Finance.
$50?
Your Excellency, haven't we met before?
Well, I won't stand for much.  And I won't stand for you if you don't show some improvement soon.  Look at your report card last month -- "D" in spelling...  six in behavior. Now who were the six?  A fine state of affairs -- no wonder you can't matriculate, now what were you saying?
I haven't been on the job five minutes and already she's making advances to me.  Not that I care -- but where is your husband?
No wonder he passed away.  I'd like to be with you to the very end. Can't you see what I'm trying to tell you -- I love you.
You're not so bad yourself, Mrs. Teasdale, when I look at you I can see that we're facing a crisis. We've got to balance the budget -- we've got to cut down everything including, you.
Don't bother me - I'm thinking -- What was that?
THIS IS TREASON!!  What a fool I was to listen to your siren song and fall a helpless victim under the insidious spell of your irresistible charms --
You satisfied your selfish whims, while nations tottered, dynasties rocked and the world plunged headlong into a chasm of chaos and oblivion --  Not bad, eh?
Perhaps he will listen to you...
And what qualities are those? Intelligence or stupidity?
Shut up!
No sir, he's got bronchitis and he's been badly beaten.
Well sir, he's quite seriously deformed, and I fear the other patients would find him... rather shocking.
Yes sir.
Yes, I'm well aware of that. But this case is quite exceptional.
No, more of an acquaintance.
Yes, I think I can.
Three quarters of an hour.
No, but I certainly shall.
Yes.
Thank you... very much.
But the variety of food here is very pleasing... I commend you.
Good morning.
John.... how can you ever forgive me?
We've made tremendous strides today, Mothershead. He listens and repeats with great attention, and this certainly isn't easy for him.
I'm sure that if Mr. Merrick made a good impression on the hospital committee they'd see that he's the exception to their rule. Now I'm not expecting miracles. I'm not saying he'll be able to read or write, but I do think that I can get him to speak for himself. I'm going to arrange things with Carr Gomm right now.  That was very good, John, very good. That's all for today. We shall do some more tomorrow. Mothershead?
Ah! It's my father!
What are what?
These? What are THESE? They're swords.
No! WAIT! ERIK! The Cloak! The Cloak Invisible! It only seems to work on my father!
What d'you mean?
Oh... well, yes, of course; it's just we're looking for the Horn Resounding and --
Oh, no no no! It's just the Horn Resounding is...
I'm sure it's lovely.
No... no...  We'd love to hear it. Wouldn't we?
Why?
Don't talk nonsense.
Not when we explain about the Great Blessing.
I know that the Great Blessing has kept the peace for a thousand years, and will keep it for the next thousand.
Well... no...
No.
Sorry.
We don't HAVE to help anybody.
Why should WE care?
So?
Oh... I feel a little... oh...
How about making friends?
We haven't got a spare place.
What do we have to do?
Got you!
How can we stops him now?
Not now, Sven...
It's no good going berserk against a dragon!
Me too.
I did. You said, things were fine.
This is the night you met Clementine, Joel. I remember watching you walk down the beach with her and I thought, oh shit.
I told you that later.
In the room?
Well, I didn't want to assume.
Anyway. Sorry. Hi.
Well, I wouldn't want to be --
I do have a tendency to use that word too much.
Thanks.
Yeah.
Yeah. I think so. It's hard to --
Yeah.
No.
No, not at all.
Fuck you, Joel. Faggot.
Yeah, Tangerine?
No.
I don't like it either, but I'm just trying to find horrible secret place to --
Hi.
Oh.
What if?
Hi.
Good. I called you at work today. They said you were home sick.
Yeah, I tried you at home. Did you get my message?
Long day thinking.
Oh, God. I miss her. I can't believe she's with that guy now! I'm never going to see her again. I love her so much. What a fucking monster she is!
I couldn't believe you did that. I was paralyzed with fear.
I've got to finish this chapter anyway.
Sorry. I just --
I know. Anyway --
This guy's only half cooked. There's no time to fuck around, Stan.
Yes?
Cole slaw, ice tea?
Welcome, Howard.
The guy we're doing? He's disappeared from the map. I can't find him anywhere.
I was away from the monitor for a second. I had it on automatic. I had to go pee.
He went home sick.
1062 Sherman Drive. Apartment 1E, Rockville Center.
Maybe after the holidays then.
I know who you are.
Save your breath for the climb.
The world isn't going to end, you dummy; I hope you know that much.  But it is going to change. It's going to change drastically, and probably in your lifetime. The Clock People see calamitous earthquakes as the agent of change, and they may be right, since there are a hundred thousand earthquakes a year and major ones are long overdue. But there are far worse catastrophes coming... unless the human race can bring itself to abandon the goals and values of civilization, in other words, unless it can break the consumption habit -- and we are so conditioned to consuming as a way of life that for most of us life would have no meaning without the yearnings and rewards of progressive consumption. It isn't merely that our bad habits will cause global catastrophes, but that our operative political-economic philosophies have us in such a blind crab grip that they prevent us from preparing for the natural disasters that are not our fault. So the apocalyptic shit is going to hit the fan, all right, but there'll be some of us it'll miss. Little pockets of humanity. Like the Clock People. Like you two honeys, if you decide to accept my offer of a lease on Siwash Cave. There's almost no worldwide calamity -- famine, nuclear accident, plague, weather warfare or reduction of the ozone shield -- that you couldn't survive in that cave.
What is Debbie's position?
You don't agree with Debbie, then?
You bet your raggedy white ass I am.
I don't know anything about it.
You're convinced the crew could still be alive? After seven years?
What?
No, thank you.
Trauma.
Hear what?
"Save yourself. From Hell."  What are you saying, are you saying that this ship is possessed?
A written briefing can't possibly anticipate the variables on a mission like this. I have to go with them.
That's the Second Containment Seal. Beyond that, engineering.
Clear and open on my mark. Three... two... one... mark.
Skipper...
...you okay?
Captain, I didn't come out here to sit on your bridge, I need to be on that ship...
That is not acceptable --
There's no danger. The black hole is contained behind three magnetic fields, it's under control.
We will take the Lewis and Clark to a safe distance and then launch tac missiles at the Event Horizon until I am satisfied that she has been destroyed.  Fuck this ship.
Watch me.
What is that?
Smith, where the hell have you been?!
Smith? Smith! Fuck!
Not acceptable. I want to know what's causing those readings. If the crew is dead, I want the bodies, I want the crew found.
Do it. Dr. Weir...
You better hurry. He's engaged the override, we can't open the inner door.
DJ!  It's okay. You're okay. Just breathe.
Skipper, Justin just activated the door. It's on a thirty second delay...
Smith's right. Neptune? There's nothing out there. If something happens, we'll be on our own.
How?
I'm alright. Please.
I wouldn't know anything about that.
Tell me. When you grew up in Brooklyn, how many astronauts did you know?  You went your own way then. You didn't listen to people. So why start now...?
I'm worried about you.
Come on. Let me buy you something to eat. Looks like you could use the company.
I already got it. Everything I want.
Should?
Yeah.  You don't wanna know the details.
Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
I swear to you they've done everything humanly possible. The best plastic surgeons in the world, Ben. You had the best --
Stay right. Left is trouble.
Last one down springs for room service.
I can go hotter!
Okay, "mom."
No, I'm sorry, for pushing you out.
Yes sir. You've got the Mayor at eight, then a nine-thirty interview with the Journal --
Top left, like you asked.  Today Wall Street. Tomorrow, who knows... maybe Washington.
What? What do you mean you --
I think it was a little more complicated than --
I gave him twenty.
Sure.
I understand the business reasons.
Oh, I think you already have.
Totally.
Why can't you do it?
Your friends use the pool too.
Don't strain yourself.
No, just a couple of surfers with no shirts on. I took care of it, Dennis.
Get a ride with somebody.
What a guy.
Let's continue.
You should work for yourself.
I'm really pretty busy...
And they don't call my parents?
Okay. Thanks a lot, Linda.
This ain't no cop.
Believe it.
Stacy. How many times do I have to tell you? You are really going to be beautiful... someday.
I don't know... I just don't feel right.
Thank you, Desmond.  What's the reason for your truancy?
You mean, you couldn't? Or you wouldn't?
Food will be eaten on your time!  Why are you continuously late for this class, Mr. Spicoli? Why do you shamelessly waste my time like this?
I know, everyone says that.
My other question is... can-I-have your-phone-number-so-I-can-ask-you out-sometime?
Me, too. I'm real sorry someone broke in and stole your tape deck.
I know everybody says it, but I really mean it.
Righto!
WHAT?
One toke. You poor fool. Wait till you see those goddamn bats.
And eat them! That bastard won't get away with this! What's going on in this country when a scum sucker like that can get away with sandbagging a Doctor of Journalism?
How about "Nickel Nick's Slot Arcade?" "Hot Slots," that sounds heavy. Twenty- nine cent hotdogs...
To do the job, of course. Here we go... a Crab Louie and quart of muscatel for twenty dollars!
What for?
Why worry? You'll like it. Nothing in the world like a Mace high. Forty- five minutes on your knees with the dry heaves...
Why not? Hell, just a minute ago, you were asking me to kill you! And now you want to kill me! What I should do, goddamnit, is call the police!
There's no choice. I wouldn't dare go to sleep with you wandering around with a head full of acid and wanting to slice me up with that goddamn knife!
They're actually nice people when you get to know them.
Don't mention that word around here. You'll get them excited.
Right. Sure as hell some dope-dealing bomb freak is going to recognize you and put the word out that you're partying with a thousand cops.
You won't need much. Just a little tiny taste, that stuff makes pure mescaline seem like ginger-beer. Adrenochrome.
How much is the lemon meringue pie?
I fear nothing.
You and a lot of other people.
Um, yeah, thirty miles east.
Who the hell would you call?
And the rest of 'em?
Shit!
Oh yeah?
What's in the back?
You don't understand sweety, Daddy doesn't pay, Daddy sees the show for free. But you do get points for being horny on a night like this.
Whoa!
HOLD THAT TIGHT!
HELLLLLLLLP!!
Is there any other way out of this place? ANYONE?
That's fine.
I'm fine, I really am.
We all have to be strong, right?
That's not the point. Frances Farmer has the world by the tit because of this studio, and now she thinks she can waltz off without a thank you. No. No, that young lady has a contract, and she's going to honor it.
I think it's time to take the gloves off.  Get me some reporters.  Particularly Louella Parsons!
I'm not!
I'm not!
God damn it, Clifford, will you shut up! I tell you, I want to give these things! I want to give them to the audience, and I can give them, I will give them, so shut up!
In my eyes, officer.
Come on. You're seriously trying to tell me the Japs can't find Los Angeles without my headlights?
We'll get you home, Frances.
Be careful, Francie.
Good.
As usual. Everything as usual, Mr. Farmer. Just give me my due.
Don't touch me.
Kaminski.
Since when do you believe the papers? They killed him, kid.
They killed him. They threw him out that window.
Eight stories.
Frances...
Whattaya think you're in now?
Huh?
Oh Harry...
What'd you do?
The speech? Real good.
You got it.
Frances, you remember my lawyer, Alma Styles?
I'm going out!
Yes, I am, and you can't stop me! You can't tell me what to do, mother. I'm a grown woman, and I can decide about my own life.
Please sit down...
I see.
And what's that?
All right. Will you please sit down now?  Symington says.
Just a little joke, Miss Farmer.
Stay calm, please.
I'll have someone show you to your room.
Yes.
Trace memories in the brain, perhaps.
I don't know.
Scandalous! What would your dear mother say?
It's not ours to decide. All that live must die. It's God's will.
Your decision. For us.
...until our wedding night. When our bodies will join.
Elizabeth. My more than sister.
They knew the risks when they signed on. I've come too far to turn back now.
You're a comfort to me, Henry.
It's a letter to my father.
No. They don't.
Victor, explain yourself.
You have a way of provoking his.  I've been watching you. You seem impatient with your studies.
You disdain accepted wisdom?
Who are you?
Good night, Brenda.
Un-hunh.
Bad bulb or no power. It's getting a little gloomy in here.
It's over twenty miles to the crossroads. Steve'll be back in an hour. Things will straighten out then. We'll take his Jeep and get help.
Where'd you get that stuff?
I don't believe you...
Wait, wait! When I was finding these goodies in the shed. I also found this letter which a camper never sent home. Listen.
Mmmmmmmph.
Umhummmmph.
Whassamatta?
That's thirty percent.
I said new, this is an '90.
So do I just follow you?
So let's do it.
Jacob.
I swear to God I won't try to escape and I'll do my best to get you into Mexico.
Yeah, I know what's going on. We got a bunch of fuckin' vampires outside trying to get inside and suck our fuckin' blood! That's it, plain and simple. And I don't wanna hear any bullshit about "I don't believe in vampires" because I don't fuckin' believe in vampires either. But I do believe in my own two fuckin' eyes, and with my two eyes I saw fuckin' vampires! Now, does everybody agree we're dealin' with vampires.
It's a flop house.
If it doesn't have a pool, we're looking for a new place.
In the room. Were you serious, or were you just foolin' around? I'm just bringing it up, 'cause if you really want me to do that for you, I will.
What you said to me in the room.
You asked me if I would --
You use 'em on the first couple of these parasites that try to bite you.
What? Are you kidding? I didn't do anything!
What am I supposed to do, Seth? He recognized us.
There's nothing wrong with me, brother. That woman tried to escape and I did what I had to do.
Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong! Once you left, she became a whole different person.
It's not your fault, it's her fault!
That's how you're lookin', Richie.
That's what you look like.
No, Richie, what do I look like?
I've been accused of that wish.
Just a friend.  We have friends, too, you know.
More than you'd guess.  It's just that we don't hold coffee klatches. If more then three of us get together at any one time, the guys think it's some kind of uprising.
Didn't take long.
I'm not sure what --
Congress and the Pentagon share a lot of plumbing.  They'll never know whose leak it is.
Sounds familiar.
Jordan.  Might we do this over lunch tomorrow?  I do very much want to talk, but now is scarcely --
Absolutely not.
Flea, 'Cool, Cortez, Newman -- take your minis, hit the water.  Go, GO!
What "all females"?  If I'm the only --
Thank you, Royce.  It was shaping up like such a tough call -- and then you go and make it so goddamn easy. Really, thank you so much.
Look.  It's not like you'd be completely out of reach.  And maybe we could call in a few favors, get you stationed at Norfolk instead of Coronado.  There are ways of dealing with these things -- I mean, if people are so inclined.
"Yes, Jordan -- I'll wait for you no matter how long."
Just askin'
McCool's that same rank.  We're both j.g.'s.
Your new roommate.
So am I.
Nice guys finish last. First rule of the jungle.
It's the maintenance entrance. Runs along the side of the tunnel. When they repaired it last year I worked on a piece about it.
Yeah, well...
How do you know?
That's the problem. He did.
Oh, I'm not married.
No. Perhaps I work too much.
They are with me!
Don't tell me why it's not, tell me what the hell it is.
We've met before.
How do I do that?
Open.
We stop we die. Keep holding the thruster down Tommy!
Like YOU know?
Yes. Good was done this .....
...Sleeves rolled halfway up the biceps...
Alex? Where are you going?
It's a television show. Okay? That's all. It's just a bunch of fake sets, and wooden props, do you understand?
There IS no quantum flux and there Is no auxiliary... There's no goddamn ship  Do you get it?
Up.
Berithium lava coming through. Use the handholds above you.
All systems are working, Commander. ,~ -cc PINK) -' C -
Of course... We'll just zap him up with the digital conveyor!
We're doing episode 31, Jason?
Hey, YOU want to drive?
Only answers to me.
On the show I talk to the computer and repeat what it says. So that's what they built.
Computer, do we have a replacement Beryllium sphere onboard?
What the hell are you talking about?
Don't do it, Tommy. He's not worth it.
Deliver the device now or I will destroy your ship.
You have ten seconds.
Home.
Yeah. "Earth." Time to get back to "Earth," kids.
Well... Sort of...
It's as far as it goes!
Pedal to the metal...
What does she see in them?
The army can survive without me.
Someday, George, you may need to act for the good of the people no matter what Congress thinks that is.  It may come down to us, or them someday.  You or them.  Cicero was right:  was is 'a time when the laws are silent'.
Christ, George, Joseph Reed's been writing letters back to Congress attacking you.  Your own aide!
Tell Mrs. Washington I am compelled to stay a while longer.
Lafayette will not be happy...
To learn to shoot cannon?
March on Philadelphia!  Get Joseph Reed, and the pigs in Congress, the speculators, who've grown fat off the war!  Get them all!  Sweep them aside!
Of course the army will acquit him, that's not the point... Arnold is a man and will understand.  What I need to understand is, John, Sam... what is happening here?  Who are those people in there?  The fat ones in silk?
Is that where our meat and boots and uniforms and muskets went?
Spies from Quebec confirm that the British are sending an entire fleet down Lake Champlain...
We have more officers created by Congress than we know what to do with.
I will continue with our French allies, concentrating on New York.
Martha!  For God's sake!
Come out and meet my soldiers. They're good people.
You don't believe I can fight from a sense of duty and patriotism?
I will not betray you, Nathanael.
George, I'm sorry.
That's not what I said!  Now, Sally, you're embarrassing me!  Watch out for her, George; she talks refinement, but she has a barbarous soul!
What else should I become?  There's no difference between Virginia and England.  I must be educated if I'm to take my place in society.  My father couldn't afford to send me to England for school -- he made a shambles of our fortunes.  Everyone laughs at me.
This, this is life indeed!  Life worth preserving, Such life as Juba never felt till now.
Come here, Farrah...
I have to ask you for that key.
Catlett says if you don't open the locker the deal's off.
That's funny, I was just wondering what I was gonna break of yours to get it away from you.
What, you gonna shoot me now, Bo?
I don't believe this.
Chili Palmer showed you my script?
Who is this?
Depends. Who's this?
What three hundred grand?
He owes me money.
I don't like waiting.
Hey, fuckball, I don't need your permission. L.A.'s an open city.
I want you to keep looking right here, okay?
You know Dick Allen, Mesa's Casino?
We're there, Harry. You signed markers for a hundred and a half, you're over sixty days past due and you haven't told anybody what the problem is.
I don't know about his wanting to meet celebrities, that's something new. But, yeah, he comes to L.A. Then after that, I don't know what happens.
She's a rock star. Every day, same time, they come down here and have breakfast. He has the egg white omelet; she has the banana pancakes. He sits facing west so he can see his billboard. She faces east so she has an excuse to wear the shades.
Cash. It happens to be waiting right at this moment in a locker at the airport.
Twenty seven hundred.
You're not going to tell me the rest?
Lemme get this straight. You aren't responsible for any lost articles like an expensive coat of mine, but you're gonna find Ray Bones' coat or get him a new one? Is that what you're telling me?
I know who he works for. Where's your phone.
I already read it. Harry left a copy at the house.
Yeah. There's a girl in it now.
Oh, shit... I'm sorry... I thought that was... I'm so sorry...
You said don't say nothing and I didn't.
You gonna start that again? You're just like him, all you got room for in your brain is one fuckin' thing.
How'd he know I was in Vegas? You tell him?
Yeah, well, I'm in L.A. now.
I'm going into the movie business.
I'm thinking about producing.
I don't think the producer has to do much, outside of maybe knowing a writer.
No. But now that you mention it, I did talk to a handsome executive at Paramount the other day... who just happened to get his hands on the script.
He said if Martin's interested, I could get a half a million for it easy. But don't worry, Harry, I'm still giving you until Friday.
Man's in town two days, thinks he's David O. fucking Selznick.
What is the vessel name, registry, and present position? Over.
Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. Please advise your salvage authority pending registry check. Over.
Yeah, a ship that's supposed to have been lost at sea fifty years ago. You don't think that's just a little freaky?
Lemme see, was that before or after the oil fire?
Bring it on, dude.
Maybe he isn't alone.
Smugglers maybe.
Then it happened before they scuttled her.
We'll stand a watch. Four on, eight off. Low man first.
With all due respect, skipper.  Part of that up there's mine. I'd kinda like to have a little say in what happens to it.
Sorry.
Right.
You're a pal.
Some charts. A crew manifest.  Looks like her last voyage was January 1953. The question is where the hell's she been since.
Her destination was Halifax, yeah.
Epps.
Yeah. Just a bird. Just a stupid bird.
Let 'em ask. This ship's legally ours now.
He's not on deck and I can't raise him on the radio.
He'll sell the scrap for three times what he paid.
You got that right.
Yeah.
Let's just take it easy here, alright? Nobody's gonna kill anybody.
Alright. Everybody grab your gear! This' is where we get off!
Didn't you hear me, grandpa? Or you got your hearing aid turned down?
I've got some important news to tell you, but it can wait till later if you're not feeling...
Well... as you know, Maxine and I have been seeing a lot of each other, and we decided it might be a good idea for all of us if she came back here to live at the end of the Summer, just so we can all get to know each other and to make sure this is what we want.
Please tell me it isn't that teenager!
I can't believe this! I thought at the very least a guy like you would never pull this kind of shit on me!
Look, I already told you I'm not going to give you a ride.
Look, I'll be done in a minute. Just wait outside.
Can I come in?
I know, she needs to die immediately.
I feel as though I've stepped into a time warp!
I remember every minute of that party.
I can never keep them all straight - was she the super-bitch?
Oh my god, he just ordered a giant glass of milk!
I know... I still can't get over that his name was "Seymour."
Yeah, he's beyond human stuff like that.
He does that every single day.
Go ahead...
God, you're really obsessed...
I thought we decided that Josh was way too cool to be interested in sex, and that he's the only decent person left in the world and we would never want to bring him down to our level and all that...
No matter what happened it would be a big disaster... Let's just try and keep everything the way it is.
Oh, hi... I almost didn't recognize you -- I think I need to get glasses; you're all blurry!
Actually, he's a really nice guy.
A mongoose... they eat snakes... you never heard of a mongoose?  That's a classic piece of vintage taxidermy. Nobody alive today knows how to do work like that.
Umm... That's not officially for sale... I might have to hang onto that for the time being.
I did too!
Fuck you, you stupid redneck hick!
NO!!!
These are older women just dressed up to look young... I think.
You work at Cook's Chicken?
What are you, a fry cook or something?
Jesus, I'd go nuts if I had to work in an office all day.
Yeah, but still...
Really?
I know, I'm sorry... I-I've been really busy...
Oh... pretty well, surprisingly... you know...
Sort of... she doesn't dislike any of that stuff... she's trying, anyway... actually, we're supposed to go antique shopping for her apartment this afternoon...
What?
I guess I probably used to when I was your age.
Sounds like a healthy way to deal with your problems.
I don't think I'm in any condition to drive.
So where would we go?
I dunno, I...
What do you want?
I-I-I...
Yeah.
He'll replace you, too- that's all you really care about.
Don't they, though?
Then why do you stay?
We have hunted since childhood.
That is correct.  Nothing.
We know three things about man-eaters. First, they always return to where they've attacked before. Second, they're always old- they can't catch other animals so they turn to us. And third, they're always alone- they've been cast out by their pride because they can't keep up.
You mean nobody died?
What happened to them?
Clearly you don't agree about building the railroad?
Underneath.  Somewhere.
Actually, I'm not eating lunch today.  I have an appointment.  In fact, I'd better go.
Certainly.
I won't.
You are personally responsible.  If I can get conjugal rights, will you visit me at Sing Sing?
Don't worry about me.  I'm like a cat.
I'm El Gato.  I always land on my feet.
Thanks.
Yes, I'm very clean.  Did they find anything at my apartment?
Peter, do you think maybe I have some genetic problem or something that makes me vulnerable to these supernatural things.
What are you doing up here?
Why would you want to be a Ghostbuster if you're already an accountant?
Well, I'd make an exception in this case if I were you.
Who are they?
Maybe they just want to appeal.
Well, I think it's important for people to know that the world is in danger.
I predict that the world will end at the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve.
This is not just some money-making scheme!  I didn't just make up the date.  I have a strong psychic belief that the world will end on New Year's Eve.
It's a rough translation from the Moldavian.
It may be ebbing and flowing from some tidal source.
No, the slime is rising.
I'm Peter --
We're going down into the sewer system to see if we can trace the source of the psycho-reactive slime flow.  We thought you might want to come along.
Yeah, and a lot easier to get to than that island.
No, I just thought --
Wonder what?
Eight o'clock?
Spengler,  see if you can find the word "Zuul" in any of the literature.  I'll take Miss Barrett home and check out her apartment.
Yes, but I have to tell you in private at a fine restaurant.
I'll cancel the reservation,  I found the name "Zuul" in ...  The Roylance Guide to Secret Societies and Sects.  I don't suppose you've  read it.
Well, the name Zuul refers to a demi-god worshipped around 6000 B.C. by the ... What's that say?
"Gozer" -- he was very big in the Sumerian religion.  One of their gods.
I'm checking on that.  I think we should meet Thursday night at nine to talk about it.
You think I enjoy giving up my evenings to spend time with clients?  I'm making an exception because I respect you as an artist and as a dresser.
I'll pick you up at your place.  I'll bring along the Roylance Guide -- we can read after we eat.
Yes.  I'm Dr. Venkman and this is Dr. Stantz.
One thing at a time.  We don't even know what it is yet.
I'm Walter Peck.  I represent the Environmental Protection Agency, Third District.
Are you Peter Venkman?
You volunteered, didn't you?  Aren't we paying you for this?
I'm studying the effect of negative reinforcement on ESP ability.
Then my theory was correct.
What?
Why not?
What do you mean "bad?"
I blame myself.
Ray, as your friend I have to tell you I think you've really gone around the bend on this ghost stuff.  You've been running your ass off for two years checking out every schizo in the Five Boroughs who thinks he's had an experience.  And what have you seen?
Looked at with your eyes.
Uh-huh.  I've heard about the rockfall, Ray. I think you've been spending too much time with Spengler.
Do you think it's wide enough?  How much?
No!  Nobody ever built them like this!  The architect was either an authentic whacko or a certified genius.  The whole building is like a huge antenna for pulling in and concentrating psychokinetic energy.
He's listed on the blueprints as I. Shandor.
What do you mean "choose?"  We don't understand.
Commodus is heaving out every thing that belonged to our father.  Except that he can't heave out his ghost.
Respectfully Caesar, Quintus and I must report.
On what charge?
He left us at dawn.
Commodus... he's a gladiator... is he mad?
You're hearing about somebody else.
When the Senate and the Emperor agree miracles can happen.
I need to give you my word when yours is worth nothing?
You don't know how wrong you are.
"But what if I wish to be purple?"
Centurions on both sides of the river are convinced the Germans will try one last offensive.  They've got nothing to lose and it's so very like them.
I've been overseeing production myself for the past three years, you'll be surprised at how wonderful our oil has become.
I refuse to be your slave.  I refuse --
On you!  Of course!  You are my bravest fighter -- the best fighter I have ever seen!
Oh, shit.  Take your time!  Don't get suckered!  This man is a murderer!  In his career he's killed over a thousand gladiators.  Please, just take the fall!
No -- why should I?
Let's get out of here, Elaine. Let's go somewhere else.
Of course not.
GET OUT!
Get out of here.
Then what?
Elaine -- that is not what happened.
I don't know.
I might.
Yes.
I don't know.
I don't know. I don't know what's happening.
What?
Who screamed?
Screaming isn't all right. Not in my house it isn't.
Mrs. Robinson -- I don't quite know how to put this --
Look -- I was thinking about that time after the party --
-- and I was wondering if I could buy you a drink or something --
Uh -- The Taft Hotel.
No. Now I know it's pretty late and if you'd rather --
What?
What?
What?
What do you mean?
Well -- I've always thought that you were a very -- nice -- person.
What?
Look -- I think I should be going --
Mrs. Robinson -- if you don't mind my saying so -- this conversation is getting a little strange. Now I'm sure that Mr. Robinson will be here any minute and --
What?
Get away from that door.
Jesus Christ!
Oh my God.
Let me out!
Yes. Yes. Let me out!
That's fine.
Well -- do you want to go up first?
I'll be up in five minutes.
Benjamin.
Isn't there something you want to tell me?
Yes.
The number.
The room number, Benjamin. I think you ought to tell me that.
Thank you.
Yes. But you might try and spice it up with a little originality.
What one.
What novel did you read.
There's nothing to tell.
Mrs. Robinson -- I have a date with Elaine. We're going for a drive.
Hello, Mrs. Robinson.
No -- they don't.
About an hour ago.
Oh no.
I've got to go.
No. No -- I'm just -- I'm just a little worried about my future. I'm a little upset about my future.
Yes, I can.
Your bank, Mr. Kringelein.
Not with strangers.
What do you want here?
Why do you hide in my room?
Because you love me -- you love me?
I don't want them now.
I know.
Yesterday I was a thief -- but now, --
I wanted money desperately -- Can you understand? -- That's why I wanted the pearls. I was threatened -- I was desperately in need of a certain big sum of money. I've been following you -- I've admired you. But I have forced myself not to think about you -- Last night, at last, I managed to came into your room and -- and now.
I couldn't go through with it.  Remarkable.
General Director Preysing!  Baron, when I was sixteen years old, I started as an office boy in that man's factory --
Do I know him -- I know him through and through.
You've lost everything?
Pardon me, Baron. Permit me again... 
I did not ask your advice.
Man -- I was at the clinic the whole night -- there are no words to describe what my wife suffered.
No -- no -- not yet. Well, I mustn't let it interfere with my duty. Any news here?
What? -- Who? -- Whom?
Good heavens. What for?
Man -- that's terrible. He was a nice fellow -- I am sorry about him.
I don't believe it -- he was a real gentleman. I know people... I'm so tired I can hardly see out of my eyes. No sleep for two nights and so many duties and now this killing in the hotel -- that means a lot of work. But it's too bad about the Baron, you always felt better when he came along -- always friendly -- such an agreeable fellow.
What, Doctor?
I had a very good opportunity, a young lady asked me to dance -- I ought to be able to dance, it seems to be very important.
Haven't you anyone -- Haven't you anybody -- you -- I mean -- Are you all alone in the world.
Everything?
I'm waiting for him here. The Baron and I have been together all day. A hundred miles an hour -- in a motor car -- and in an aeroplane -- It was marvelous --
Oh, thank you, Miss Flaemm. Oh, please, Miss Flaemm -- Permit me, Miss Flaemm, won't you have something sweet -- a Louisiana flip.  A Louisiana flip.
Yes -- that --
I'm the stenographer.
Moreover -- Do you mind if I smoke?  I went to Florence once, too.
Here, hold up!
Scratched --  We did not take the initiative.
You've talked enough today, you're hoarse now.
All right, Suzette -- quickly -- hurry.
Wait a minute. I've got to ask myself.
I could not think of not accepting.
The troupe, the scenery, everything -- all on board, waiting. You have a rehearsal in Vienna tomorrow morning. Come, Madam, are you mad?
I'm not getting away with anything, Bobo.
I was down on that horse, Bobo. Not as much as I should have been, but there was a lot of action on those--
Roy? He's always crying.
I like you, too.
Oh, Henry, no, that's just boring.
My son will be all right. If he isn't, I'll have you killed.
I don't know offhand what your best year's been, we can look it up. The idea is, we'll top it by fifteen percent.
You do not! Roy Dillon? Cornball clown pictures? Commission salesman? It's all a front, isn't it? You're on the grift, I know you are. You're working some angle, and don't tell me you're not because I wrote the book!
That's me. That's who I am. You were never cut out for the rackets, Roy, and if you --
Four grand. For the hospital. Is that enough?
I pay my debts.
You must have some money.
And Myra's stuff?
Far enough. Maybe up to San Francisco. Or St. Louis, someplace new. Start over.
You're smart, Lilly, and you're good-looking. You won't have any trouble finding a job.
Well, you're gonna start, if you hope to live through this. A square job and a quiet life. You start showing up at the track or the hot spots and Bobo's boys will be all over you.
Not any more. Lilly, listen, I'm giving you good advice. I'm following it myself.
I thought it over, and you were right. You wanted me out of the rackets, and now --
I thought you'd be happy for me. After all, you --
I know you do, so that's why --
No.
I have to have that money, Roy. What do I have to do to get it?
Are you sure?
You ain't seen nothin.
Open your door.
Open it and find out.
Well, mostly, I don't believe it.
No. I mean, I don't believe it. Lilly is not a suicide. I know my mother, nothing would make her check out.
Gun?
It may be Lilly, but it isn't suicide.
My mother... Well, I guess it doesn't matter now. She worked for gamblers. She always knew they might turn on her some day.
Unable to escape, she turns and attacks the killer, but doesn't connect.
Do I know you?
You're so predictable.
Afraid not.  You can pick your friends, but you can't pick your family.
You saw that Michael Meyers display.  You've got to be pretty twisted to come up with something like that.
Michael Meyers.
He's my brother.
You say, "The key to my heart," and I'm gonna hurl.
Reality check, dillweed.  This is 1995.
You can't expect us to stay here --
Lock the doors and call your husband. Get your family as far away from Haddonfield as possible.
Mrs. Strode, Michael Myers is here to kill his family.  And he won't stop until you are all destroyed.  I only thank God that I found you before he did.
Black magic ...  'In ancient times, Thorn was believed to cause sickness, famine and death. Translated literally, it was the name of a demon spirit that delivered human sacrifices ... on the Celtic celebration of Samhain.'
'When applied directly to another person, Thorn could be used to call upon them confusion and destruction -- to literally visit them with the Devil.'
Please try to understand, Terence. I've already made up my mind.
Amazing, isn't it?  I even taught him to drive.
You know what gets me?
One of them is the doctor, whose weapons are compassion, unselfishness, peacefulness-- maudlin concern.
He and his love are like a retiarius.  Do you know what a retiarius is?
How do you know that?
When?
Oh.  I'd forgotten.
Really?
Sorry.
You actually sold insurance!
Sir?
Nothing.
No.
No.
We thought a doctor might help.
We thought it was an emergency.
He's a very decent man, Harold.
Shouldn't you lie down?
Paul said you were awfully sick.
You shouldn't have talked to Norbert that way.
I have a brain.
Almost a Christmas scene.
Just one favor.
I want you to tell me that you loved me once.
There it is.  Give it to me.
Ahh--then she's still alive.
And still Mrs. Harold Ryan?
She still has just the one child-- the boy?
More and more we find ourselves laying aside false pride and looking into the pharmacopoeias of primitive people.  Curare, ephedrine--we've found some amazing things.
That's an editorial we, of course. I haven't turned up anything personally.
And terror, if you don't mind.
I dunno.
Wouldn't you rather have your mother marry me than him?
All my dreams have suddenly collapsed.  We did have a lot of laughs together, Penelope.
It is an emergency, isn't it?
Then get him.
Women are always late.  You'll find out.
Take plenty of cigars.
I must take you to an emergency ward sometime--on a Saturday night. That's also fun.  I came to see Selma, as a matter of fact.
Oh--look at the poor, crucified violin, would you?
Then we'd stay home and eat venison or something, and look through the scrapbooks.  I've got a friend who has a whole freezer full of striped bass and caribou meat.  I'm going to bring that boy back.
You're not Vice, are you?  Do you work for the Los Angeles Police Department, or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency?
I have to ask you that. If you were Vice you couldn't deny it. You ought to dress less square. You wouldn't get hassled so much. Here, let me help you get that tie off.
I like it, Mr. Van Dorn.
Not really. But if you want me to tone it down...
I am.
Wait, wait. I'm trying to figure this out. This is like Rona Barrett. Before you become saved, God already knows who you are?
So it's already worked out. The fix is in?
Wow. Then why be good? Either you're saved or you ain't.
You really believe all that?
I thought I was fucked up.
If you see anything from the inside it makes sense. You ought to hear perverts talk. A guy once almost had me convinced to let his dachshund fuck me.
It doesn't make any sense to me.
But then you'll forget about me.
Get out.
Get out!
Pretty good.
You ain't goin' nowhere alone.
Oh.  Why is it that you want to get into film financing?
What exactly do you have in mind?
In other words, you want to get laid?
It's cool. Why do you think I got in the movies? How much poon do you think you get in the car wash business?  Look, fifty thousand dollars buys a lot of pussy. You can get your joint pulled by beautiful girls every night for the rest of your life for fifty thousand dollars. So why fuck with the movie business?
If you want to watch when we shoot a film, for fifty bucks, I let guys stand around and watch. It's a lot cheaper.
Don't get me wrong. A couple years ago, I woulda jumped at fifty thousand dollars possible financing. But the Lord's been good to me. I can now finance any films I choose. Big ones, small ones. Right now we're setting up a two hundred thousand dollar feature film. Live sound. I like to keep my own money in my films. That way you don't have to share the profits. There's plenty of guys in town that'll take it, though. But if I was you, Mr... what was your name again?
...I'd just start my own business. That's what I did. Get into kid porn. That's big now. Why don't you come around the set? Meet some people. If you still want to invest, I'll ask around.
Okay. Keep in touch with my secretary.
You're taking a big chance.
Oh no? What you gonna do? Get a job?
Hello.
You're welcome.  Did you know him?
Me neither. I heard he was eighty years old. I'll be eighty next week. A good time to move on, don't you think?
I mean, seventy-five is too early, but at eighty-five, well, you're just marking time and you may as well look over the horizon.
Eh, fine.
Oh, it's fine. Fine.
Oh, it's only a machine, Harold. It's not as if it were <u>alive</u>, like a horse or a camel. We may live in a machine age, but I simply can't treat them as equals.  Of course, the age has its advantages.
No more revolts.
Well, I don't...
I like you, Maude.
... of you. You'll all end up like this.
Oh, you've thought of everything. And champagne.
Oh, Harold. 
Harold!
I don't know.
No. It's the junk. I like to look at junk.
Harold! That's <u>disgusting</u>!
Julia.
I knew you'd come.
Yes. You're a girl who remembers her promises.
You a doctor, too?
Are you crazy?
WHY?
You're in the Malahide Institute. It's a psychiatric hospital. But, hey, don't feel judged -- it was just the nearest place to bring you. Remember? You and your boyfriend...?
Don't worry. He's O.K. We sent him home hours ago. Jeez, what a story.
Liz left us, Red. Take the hint.
Skip to the end, willya?  How do I kill it -- ?
There is a place -- a dark place where evil slumbers and awaits to return. From there it infects our dreams. Our thoughts. Grigory gave us a glance tonight --
Grigory Yefimovich Rasputin --
Spiritual advisor to the Romanovs.  In 1916, at a dinner in his honor, he was poisoned, shot, stabbed, clubbed, drowned and castrated.
Icthyo Sapiens, April 14, 1865.
This -- ? This is nothing. You know what'll kill me?  Her.
I knew those men better than you did --
No one ever helps me. It's my job.
Not hungry.
Red, I --
I like that...
Look, do you want the bed in or not?
Oh, sod you.
It's just a puzzle box.
Who are you?
Well, I didn't mean to open that thing. You can go back wherever you came from.
I have to speak to my father.
It's important.
Poor baby.
Hush now. It's all right Frank's here.
That's right. This is Frank you're talking to, remember? FRANK.
What do you want me to do.
I don't think so. She'll want Larry first.
Maybe.
There's very little I can do about it.
Like this? Look at me! LIKE THIS?
I need a skin. Then we leave --
I don't know. Probably wanted a hideaway.
I cut myself.
Kirsty.
Just soda.
Please.
That depends.
Am I?
I'm not going to change my mind, Dad.
Of course.
It's late.
Please. I want to see you home. All right?
If there's a train.
We walk.
Sure. Why not?
Bullshit.  The guy was going to buy one record -- which we didn't even have -- and leave and never come back again anyway.  Why not have a little fun?  Big fucking deal.
He offended me with his terrible taste.
Oh, now you're defending that motherfucker?  You're going soft in your old age, Rob.  There was a time when you would have chased him out of the store and up the street.  Now all of a sudden I'm offending your golf buddy.  You're right, Rob.  I am so sorry. How are we ever going to make enough money to get you and Laura into the country club?
But in your opinion, would I definitely go?
Whatever.  Okay. "Tell Laura I Love Her." That'd bring the house down. Laura's mom could sing it.
I'd want "One Step Beyond" by Madness. And "You Can't Always Get What You Want."
Haven't seen it.
Oh.  Right.  But I'd forgotten about that.  I wasn't biting the idea.
It's the new --
No.  No.  Mom wants you to come to the funeral.  It's on Friday.
Did you tell that to Marco when he did his what-does-it-all-mean thing with you?
-- FUCK OFF!
Come on, Rob.  My relationship with Laura has obviously disturbed you a great deal.
We are not talking jokey understatement here, Rob.  We're talking actionable harassment.  Ten phone calls a night, hanging around outside my house...
We've noticed and we're glad.  But, you know... how are we going to make peace here?  We want to make things easier for you.  What can we do? Obviously I know how special Laura is, and I know things can't be good for you at the moment.  I'd hate it if I lost her.  But I'd like to think that if she decided she didn't want to see me anymore, I'd respect that decision.  Do you see what I'm saying?
Good.  So shall we leave it at that then?
Think about it, Rob.
You really believe that?
Hi.  I've been looking for an envelope of my receipts from last month and I'm thinking I didn't take them with me.  Have you seen them around?
I'm sorry to call, but I need that stuff...
We'll talk some other time.
Those aren't mine.
They're not really, though, are they? I know you bought them for me, and that was really sweet of you, but that was when you were trying to turn me into you.  I can't take them, I know they'd just sit around staring at me, and I'd feel embarrassed by them and... they don't fit in with the rest of what's mine, do you understand?  That Sting record you bought for me... that was a present for me.  I like Sting and you hate him.  But the rest of this stuff...  Who the hell is Nick Lowe?  Or Gram Parsons?  Or the Boredoms?  I don't know these people.  I...
I'm sorry to go on about it.  But, I don't know, there's a lesson here somewhere, and I want to make sure you get it.
You're being deliberately obtuse.
Well, think about it.
I don't know.  Sometime.  Later. Listen, Rob, would you have sex with me?
I want to feel something else than this.  It's either that or I go home and put my hand in the fire.  Unless you want to stub cigarettes out on my arm.
It'll have to be sex, then.
Hey, great idea.  What I'll do is, tomorrow I'll get a hold of a box full of mint Elvis Presley 78s on the Sub label, and I'll pay for it that way.
Fantastic.  The Girlfriend Lottery.
But it wasn't supposed to be like this.  When I met you we were the same people and now we're not, and...
Well, you were the kind of person who came to the Artful Dodger and I was the kind of person who deejayed at the Artful Dodger.  You wore jeans and T-shirts, and so did I.  And I still do, and you don't.
No, but...
But why doesn't it matter that we're not the same people we used to be?
And hairstyles and clothes and attitude and friends and...
You're tougher.
Harder.
I'm alright.
You're being stupid.
It's gonna be fine.  These people are ready for anything.
God, I hate that time.  That pick up stuff time.  I just went through that before I came here.  You know that song "Patsy Cline Times Two" I play?  That's about me and my ex dividing up our record collections.
Thank you.
Hi, Rob.  It's your mother.
Well we don't.
This one came unassembled.
I'd like to ask you about the claymore.
It's quite rare you know, some- thing so common in its time so well looked after all these years.
Are you?
It's beautiful.
Empty.  And fear.  Fear of those that would kill you and fear of those that would love you.  It can never last, and in the end you always end up destroying both.
It's all the same.  Half lives that never go away.
All of it finished.
Thanks.
You see that desk?  _Your_ desk?  You see the crap piled up on it?
Some cling to sanity through time with the one continuity and trad0 ition their lives have known: The Game.  You and I Conor, we are different from all others around us.  You know this, you can feel it.  We are flesh and bone like any man, but unlike our neighbors we are rather difficult to injure,  permanently.
You are still so very young.
Not even a single lifetime.
It's like to kill me first.
What would you like?
Like you.
Mulet.
Where did you learn that?
Your father must be smart.
Not tonight.  Tonight I have a drink with an old friend.
Of sorts.
That's none of your business.
A double guard's been thrown around the jail, municipal buildings, railroad terminals, and elevated stations to prepare for the expected general uprising of radicals at the hour of execution.
The Sheriff has just received four more letters threatening his life, but he says nothing can interfere with his duty.
Au revoir, mon capitaine.
Certified and everything. Got it right here in my wallet... What? No, he's not here -- I'm in a phone booth.
Thank you.
I know you will, Bruce. Are you going to live with your mother?
That'll be nice. A home with mother. A real honeymoon. In Albany, too. Ow!
Certified! I'm afraid Hildy'd feel ashamed to think she hadn't trusted you.
The money? Why?
Gee! Take a look, will you?
Give me the District Attorney's office.  I'll tell you what you'll be doing -- making brooms in the State penitentiary.  Hello, D'Arrasty! This is Hartwell. Come over to my office, will you? I've just arrested a couple of important birds and I want to take their confessions.
What's the matter?
Dead?
Sweeney?  Well, after all, he didn't do it on purpose, did he?
Well, haven't you got anybody else?
No!
Keep away --
That's what I'm afraid of. "Any time -- any place -- anywhere!"
Get away, Svengali.
Listen, you bumble-headed baboon --
Please! Will you just --
I'm not working for any other paper!
Look at this! 
Because it happened to be a colored policeman.
Especially with an election coming up in a few days.
Huh!
How much do you want on it?
Where's some paper?
What did you do with her?
You been in a fight?
What is it? Here!
Now don't argue, Hildy.  How about it, Judge?
What do you mean, I handed her? The patrol wagon was on the wrong side of the street.
I don't think she's talking much... You know what I mean?
I can't Hildy. It means my job! It means --
I know, I just want to give him a thrill.
This Egelhoffer's pretty good.
Don't you remember? He's the guy went to Washington to interview the Brain Trust, and gave out a statement that they were all sane. It created a sensation!
Do you want us to call the cops and have them give you the boots?
Just coffee.  And you, sir?
I've got a right to carry a gun if I want to.
That's good, because my health ain't what it used to be.
Now what do you say?
That's good, Earl. Oh, they've got another alienist to see you. He ought to be here any minute. Don't go to sleep, will you?
Hildy, how'd you like a couple of tickets for the hanging?
Phone for you, Hildy.
Oh, some insurance man. Are you in?
No -- what?
Don't you mother me! Playing cat-and- mouse with my poor boy! Keeping him looked up -- making us miss two trains -- and supposed to be married tomorrow!
You don't have to go with me at all! Just give me my son's money and you can stay here forever as far as I'm concerned. Stay with that murderer you caught!
What's that? Only -- you're getting too near. I don't trust anybody.
Keep away!
Ssh!
I couldn't work in the city. You see, I've got my family in the country.
No, I don't think so.
I got two kids going to school there, and if I changed them from one town to another, they'd lose a grade.
Yeah?
Come on, fellas.
I think you hit him, Grandpa. He was limping when he ran off.
Yes, you was. Make him talk.
We thought it was poison.
Thanks, son. I can hear it. I'm not sleeping, just closing my eyes.
...two Indians to fan me all night. The heat.
And I'm still just a lad myself.
Not till Christmas, I don't suppose.
There, there, my baby.
How many of our class left? You and me out of twenty-eight.
You might still have a house.
Look after yourself, Grace.
Am I? Maybe I am.
Tipsy, topsy, turvy.
Baby! Stop!
Come on.
I was just wondering.
Are you two gals all funny with each other?
You know... a couple of queers.
I was just wondering, cause you got a pissy look about you... like a real pussy licking bitch.
Sqeaky! No way, she ain't that hot.
Yeah but, she reminds me of this chick that I remember from fourth grade... called a... shit, what did we call her?  Oh yeah, Patty Pee-pee Pants... when ever she got called on by Miss Chumski, this chick would piss in her pants and start bawling.
Better than pissing... anyway so, what's your choice?
Yeah, no shit.
Oh yeah, I forgot about her. She was pretty hot.
I thought she tried to murder a witness for the prosecution.
Dude, talk about baggage, that ain't no carry-on shit, that's some heavy duty Samsonite shit.
Hot has got nothing to do with it.
I'll help ya.
I mean obviously we will compensate you for your troubles.
There's a dog in the road.
I gotta open the gate.
It won't work.
He should be back in a couple hours.
When?
Tell me about it.
Yeah, hey how far do you think we are from your Dad's?
Shhhhhh, quiet.
Turn on the headlights. See if anything is out there.
I'll bet you are... you are a naughty little thing aren't ya.
What!
Oh, come now... we're all creatures of God and freaks in our own way...  ...but if you'll notice...  right here, needs a little something, heh?
Wait, I want to say good-bye.
Call Wydell.
Chief said pick him up and take him with us on our house to house. Guy's an ex-cop, thinks he can help.
Yeah, well I guess it's tough to sit on the sidelines and wait when your own kid's missing... besides, ain't no such thing as an ex-cop.
That must be him.
It's going famously, son, famously!
Not at all.
Of course not.
Hmmmph.
Hmmph. Hmmph.  Nathan, we have to talk, you and I.
Not in front of the boy.
Was I? I wasn't a tad stiff?
But I like being human now.
Oh, Rosie.
I like you, too, Nathan.
Yeah  But I have some peculiarities also.
I think he's feral.
He looks perfectly fine.
I don't understand you. This is fascinating and you just want to run away. I mean, here we have a human being totally uncontaminated by civilization, totally free, and all you want to do is run back to your...
What?
Look at him. He doesn't understand English. He moves like an animal.
Nathan, what the hell are you talking about?
Oh no. You can't take him from his home, Nathan.
I won't allow you. It's wrong. He's happy here.
You'd be taking away his freedom, Nathan.
Of course not.
No.
I'm just preoccupied.
Yeah. It's nice. It's really good.
Shh. It's okay.  It's okay, Lila. You're what I want. You know that. You're exactly what I want.
Sure. Of course.
That's great.
Yeah. Puff and I got into a big, philosophical discussion. He's really quite well read, considering he's only been literate for a month now. He's going to make us famous, Lila.
Seemed fine. Quiet evening enjoying his new digs.
Shit.
I've fallen in love with somebody else, Lila.
I fucked her! Okay? I fucked her. I'm sorry. But that's what the hell I did.
Yes.
Yeah, well, I'm sorry. The human heart is a strange thing.
Lila...
It's wonderful! Do you think I'm ready? Do you really?
Oh, I will!  Your very trust has instilled an enormous sense of responsibility in me. I don't want to disappoint you.
Got it.
Yes... Derek.
Soon as I finish my coffee.
That's the way it's done.
All I want's the money.
What did he say?
What? And he -- he hustles pool?
How good is he?
C'mon, Bert. Let me play him.
I'm a businessman, kid.
Yeah, we're gonna make a lotta money together, from now on.
No, it don't have to be fifty. It can be thirty... twenty-five.
Aaaahhhh!
If it didn't happen in Louisville, it'd happened someplace else. If it didn't happen now, it'd happen six months from now. That's the kinda dame she was.
Okay... Okay. Nobody can beat you.
A son.
Talk to me, Charlie.
Aah! I've got no stomach for that any more. I've had that kind of life.
I'll connect. I'll get you your money back.
Never been out of it. I'm gonna beat that fat man... with that curly hair, and those diamond rings, and that carnation.
I told you you'd get your money back.
Oh no, nothing for me.
I don't rattle, kid. But just for that I'm gonna beat you flat.
I used to be an actress.
I'm a college girl. Two days a week, Tuesdays and Thursdays, I go to college.
I'm the emancipated type. Real emancipated.
I'm not.
I've got nothing else to do on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
I drink.
No. No more. I'm getting sleepy.  Thank you very much, Mr...?
The name should be Eddie. What should my name be?
I like it to be what it is. It's Sarah. That's a biblical name. You want to know its meaning?
No.
What do you want me to do, just step out in the alley? Is that it?
I've got something in my bag.
A loser?
Would he know?
Why did he tell you?
What does he do, this Bert Gordon?
Is he a winner?
Is that what makes a winner?
Does it bother you? What he said?
You're not a loser, Eddie. You're a winner. Some men never get to feel that way about anything. I love you, Eddie.
Well, what's the matter?
Game's over, Eddie.
You watch me.
It was warm.  I was outside.  The ocean?
With them?
We move.  Place to place.
Have you always had it?
Have you looked inside?
What's inside?
Who?
Please.
That's fine.
This should be the heaviest shower of the year.
That's a doozy of a dream, son.
It was all made of stuff that's happened to you in the last few days.  The sand pit in back of the house, and the meteor shower, and meeting your teacher and the colonel at school, and being afraid of the new kids because you don't know them ...
I'm sorry, Mr. Gardner.  I was out of my office for a minute and when I got back -- he was gone.
We'll be very careful.  But we have to see.  If something landed there, there would be a big scar in the ground. Wouldn't there?
Mom -- this is the best show all year.
It's really nice of you to help us.
We're going with you. I mean, we're going too.
We'll be well on our way out of there before we shoot that thing off.
Then get them out of there.
Checkmate.
Moishe, please, don't talk.
It's not me. They're overriding the system.
Yes, Sir.
My God, the Vice President and the Joint Chiefs...
You know me...
Don't worry, big guy. I'm sure she got out of here before it happened.
You're not going anywhere. You hear me? I'm still your father.
Yes.
Egyptian Mail. Morning edition.  Run!
Call Donovan, Marcus. Tell him I'll take that ticket to Venice now.
Arghhh! Oh!
I know who you are Mr. Donovan. Your contributions to the museum over the years have been extremely generous. Some of the pieces in your collection here are very impressive.
Yes?
It's a rubbing Dad made of the Grail Tablet.
So it did.
And the head.  You hit me, Dad!
Don't worry -- I'm fine.
Don't get sentimental now Dad -- save it 'til we get out of here.
What???
All right, move! Move! Rock your Chair. Do what I do.
Relax.
This could be close.
Junior?! Dad...
Because you're looking for the Holy Grail.
No.
If you don't let go, Doctor Jones, we'll both die.
My soul is prepared. How's yours?
No, he's a very shrewd old boy. Power behind the throne and all that. He actually runs this whole province.
No, no, that is Uhmed Singh, the present Maharajah's late father.
Dr. Jones, in our country a guest does not usually insult his host.
At last I have the ashes of my sacred ancestor!
Okay, Shorty... see you in the morning... I'm going to have a little -- word with Willie.
Mola Ram -- you're about to meet Kali -- in Hell!
Relax, I've been giving him lessons.
He told me they knew I was coming here.
The old man saw it in a dream.
He said that's whey they were at river -- they were waiting for the plane to fall down.
What?!
Just one arm!
PET IT??!!
THE WHAT?!
I'd be safer sleeping with that snake.
You're talking to an authority in that area.
A what?!
Yes.
Yes, they believe you.
What for?
Yes.
Yes.
You're gonna explain.
Yeah.
Yes...Yes...I'll explain it all. Just put the gun down.
Whatever you do, just...don't stop.
Find You?
Nothing!
We'll change your appearance.
What was?
What?
It is my business. It's my name.
Just hold them close and stay still.
Is that all?
That's not funny.
Trying to analyze this stuff. Now...go to the medicine shelf and take ---- and ----.
You said 100,000 yen for the right Sony Walkman.
The man we want has the PEM, and is across the border by now.
GRUNER switched the chip to him, not from him, then he led us away again...to Chiang Cho.
She's in love with you. Anyone can see that.
JOE It's not love. It's like. It's real strong like. And I got your information. Now, get off my back!
Don't worry.
Who's our little man?
No. If anything happened, you'd be stuck in there like he was.
I have a new client.
Yes. Joe.
No, it wasn't, It was intentional.
Not you. Them.
I don't know Who.
Sir?
Yeah. One of the corniest lines I ever heard.
That you're not crazy.
You talk to yourself.
Why do you do it?
You did.
You're talking to me.
You're doing...Okay.
They'd never talk in front of me. They'd walk away up the beach. Nervous about something.
Ryuji and Gruner.
Friend of Gruner. Just went along for the party.
It was a good job. Not many ways for a foreigner to make money here. Ryuji hires me to organize business meetings...take care of things.
I said just relax. I'm in full control.
Why did you, then?
Do something!
You are, I've seen you.
It was you.
But you did it. It was you.
I'm sorry. We're running behind. So many applicants...so few jobs... If you'll just have a seat.
...Mr. Athol will be with you as soon as possible. Will you be able to wait?
Whoever took it does.
Lowell?
Get me Wigand.
...fuck is this? Fuck!
Oh, no, of course they're not influenced by money. They work for free. And you are a Volunteer Executive Producer.
No, I'm questioning your hearing! You hear "reasonable" and "tortious interference." I hear... "Potential Brown & Williamson lawsuit jeopardizing the sale of CBS to Westinghouse." I hear... "Shut the segment down. Cut Wigand loose. Obey orders. And fuck off...!" That's what I hear.
I am? You pay me to go get guys like Wigand, to draw him out. To get him to trust us, to get him to go on television. I do. I deliver him. He sits. He talks. He violates his own fucking confidentiality agreement. And he's only the key witness in the biggest public health reform issue, maybe the biggest, most-expensive corporate-malfeasance case in U.S. history. And Jeffrey Wigand, who's out on a limb, does he go on television and tell the truth? Yes. Is it newsworthy? Yes. Are we gonna air it? Of course not. Why? Because he's not telling the truth? No. Because he is telling the truth. That's why we're not going to air it. And the more truth he tells, the worse it gets!
C'mon, what are you? And are you a businessman? Or are you a newsman?! Because that happens to be what Mike and I do for a living...
If we could take a look, Mr. Wigand...
Well, with tortious interference, I'm afraid... the greater the truth, the greater the damage.
They own the information he's disclosing. The truer it is, the greater the damage to them. If he lied, he didn't disclose their information. And the damages are smaller.
I'm going to the store. You need anything?
Soy sauce...
That's my stuff from the office...
I didn't want to leave it there...
I got fired this morning... Where else am I gonna take it?
Thomas Sandefur...
I can't... I've got to fly to Boston tomorrow.
That's right...
What's your interest in this, Mr. Bergman?
How are the rooms? Comfortable?
Oh, lots.
But in all that time, Mike, did you ever get off a plane, walk into a room, and find that a source for a story changed his mind? Lost his heart? Walked out on us? Not one fucking time! You want to know why?
I'm going to tell you why. Because when I tell someone I'm going to do something, I deliver.
Oh, please, Mike...
No, you give me a break! I never left a source hung out to dry, ever. Abandoned. Not 'til right fucking now! When I came on this job, I came with my word intact. I'm gonna leave with my word intact. Fuck the rules of the game! Hell, you're supposed to know me, Mike. What the hell did you expect? You expect me to lie down? Back off? What, get over it?
Like what? Corporate responsibility? What, are we talking celebrity here?
Is there anything you want to know about me, Mr. Wigand...?
Like what?
Johnson & Johnson. Union Carbide in Japan. I was general manager and director of new products. I speak Japanese. I was a director of corporate development at Pfizer. All health-related.  What else? Outside the "zone"...?
No.
You believe that?
You believe that because you get information out to people... something happens?
Maybe that's just what you've been telling yourself all these years to justify having a good job? Having status? And maybe for the audience, it's just voyeurism? Something to do on a Sunday night. And maybe it won't change a fucking thing. And people like myself and my family are left hung out to dry. Used up! Broke, alone!
I don't think you really understand --
I have to put my family's welfare on the line here, my friend! And what are you puttin' up? You're puttin' up words!
What?!
No.
I do not think that you "know" for me... what it is to walk in my shoes...  ...for my kids to have seen it... for them to know why I've put them through what I did... the public airing of that... the testament to why I did what I did... you're telling me is not going to see the light of day.
No, no. Don't call the police!  Just tell him I'm on the phone with you... My name is Lowell Bergman... Just tell him that.
There is -- there is no family.
Liane has filed for divorce...
Seven...
I'd rather play than talk about it.  What did you want to see me about? I don't like being back here.
We'd better go before we get thrown out.
Who's the pigeon?
Who do you want me to kill?
Is that... one person?
Sustained.
That was -- oh, shit. What if he's on his way over there?
Oh boy. If he only knew.
You didn't ask me here to pick me up. You could get in trouble for that.
Have you ever been married, Miles?
You don't believe in it.
You just haven't met the right person.
Although knowing you as I do -- there will be no settlement. This time it will be complete and total annihilation.
I'm a little embarrassed. I'm not used to losing control with such -- volume.
What is it Miles?
I love you. I want to have your baby.
That's true.
We were about to request the primary residence, and thirty percent of the remaining assets.
I wish I had your discipline.
It's not Ming. It's Tong.
At this point my client is still prepared to consider reconciliation.
My client is prepared to entertain an amicable dissolution of the marriage without prejudice.
My client proposes a thirty day cooling off period.
My client asks that you not initiate proceedings pending his setting certain affairs in order.
Heh heh.
That's the problem. I can't afford to give her anything.
I know that sounds rough but I'm about to close on a deal to develop some mini-malls, and I'm mortgaged up to my ass. If this deal goes south, I'm ruined -- I'll lose millions.
Well -- is that possible?
We wanted Ruth here for your protection as well --
Ramona! Don't get Mia Farrow on us.
Who's Rex's guy?
That's typical of your daughter. Takes those things for granted.  Why does she think I lugged her all the way from Miami  for the love of it?
Oh, she does, huh? Isn't that sweet of her! You don't , I suppose.
If I didn't I wouldn't be here!  I've got it all itemized. 
I won't thank you! I'll never thank you!
I'll shout to my heart's content! I'll scream if I want to.
Lower the boats!
But the lady says
Holy Smokes! You'll never get out yourself! Better phone for some help.
I didn't ask for your advice. 
You're not going to notify my father, are you?
If you play your cards right, you might get some money out of it. 
Listen, if you'll promise not to do it, I'll pay you. I'll pay you as much as he will. You won't gain anything by giving me away as long as I'm willing to make it worth your while. I've got to get to New York without being stopped. It's terribly important to me. I'd pay now, only the only thing I had when I jumped off the yacht was my wrist watch and I had to pawn that to get these clothes. I'll give you my address and you can get in touch with me the minute you get to New York.
You're not really serious about this, are you?
That's Father at work, What'll I do?  Peter, what'll I do?
What?
What if nobody stops for us?
You're an expert, I suppose.
There's no end to your accomplishments.
Oh, no!
Yeah. He finally agreed to let us have a room.
Talked him out of it. He thinks we're going to stay a week. I'll have to think of something before morning.
I'm glad you think so. If you ask me, it's foolish. I told you there's no sense in our staying here tonight. We could make New York in less than three hours.
Okay.  Cottage Number Three.
Whome?  Want to see me?
Husband?
Isn't he here?
Why, he'll be back.
Just your imagination.
Don't get sore, Joe. This is something you got to do for me. I need a thousand dollarsand I need it quick. I'm in a jam.
To tear down the Walls of Jericho.
Never mind . . . Listensuppose I should tell you that Ellen Andrews is going to have her marriage annulled.
That she's going to marry somebody else.
Would an exclusive story like that be worth a thousand bucks to you?
Well, I got it, Joe.
It's all right here. Give me the thousand and it's yours.
Wait a minute, Joe. Use your bean. I couldn't afford to hand you a phoney yarn, like that. I'd be crazy. There isn't a newspaper in the country'd give me a job after that! I could go to jail!
Sure. I wouldn't blame you, either.
I am, Joe.
Yeah.
For heaven's sake, Joestop being an editor for just a minute.  We've been friends for a long time, haven't we? You ought to know when I'm serious. This is on the level.
Looks like it, don't it?  Here's the woman, ma.
Okay. Just remember that. Now beat it.
Come on, scram! And stay away from that bus.
You knew you weren't talking to some low life fag, you know.  He had command of the king's English.
Always - like tits on a pig.  I wish I had a million of those bimbettes.
Like I told to the Washington boys, Bertrand called that summer and asked me to help the kid upgrade his Marine discharge...
Three, four.  He came in with a few Cubano swishes one time I remember...
Hey, where y'at, Frank?  You're wasting your time here.  Big Jim gave strict orders.  No FBI allowed.
Boss would fry me in hog fat if he knew... 
Yeah, I guess you do.
Frank, I don't want to hear it.
And that's where you met Oswald for the first time?
That's gonna be tough.  Nobody's talking.
He'd die pretty quick, either a heart storm or a ruptured blood vessel in the brain.
Not in a routine autopsy, but if we looked at the spinal fluid, there might be a high level of iodine, but it's difficult to know.  Whatcha thinkin', Jim?
If it's a suicide, I seen weirder, Jim. 
Would you say this "Leon" was actually Lee Harvey Oswald?
What?
Makes sense - he's a spokesman.
I know.
That's right.  When I saw him on TV, I was shocked.  I said to my family, "that was the man I saw in the truck."
That's what bothers me, Mr. Garrison. You see, they've been altered.  My statements...
It's not funny, Jim, I'm scared.
Well... yeah.
What are you driving at, boss?
Between six and seven seconds.
Didn't Hoover say something about that?  The leaves had fallen off in November?
The Zapruder film is the proof they didn't count on, Lou.  We gotta get our hands on it.
Why not just shoot Kennedy coming up Houston?  There's plenty of time - he's out in the open - a frontal shot?
I've been called everything under the sun, Jerry.  Call me whatever you like.
I don't know if I should talk about this.
If you buy what you read in the paper.
I didn't say that.  All I know is he died suddenly just before the Warren Report came out.
Well, I guess now that Guy's dead, it don't really matter... it was about the people hanging around the office that summer.  I wasn't really part of the operation, you know.  I was handling the private-eye work for Guy when that came in - not much did - but that's why I was there... it was a nuthouse.  There were all these Cubans coming and going.  They all looked alike to me.
Okay, you handle it, Numa.  I don't have time for this nonsense.  We've obviously got the bastards worried now.  I'm going to Washington.
The job manages to keep me pretty busy.
I went. I did. I took my mother and little brother.
I know. That's why I went.
Sure, 'cause I didn't ask her if I could go.
In his inside coat pocket.
This is Special Agent Ray Nicolet with Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. Would you mind if we looked in that bag?
Take your time.
Sure, ever been to the Riverbottom?
It's okay. It's a cop hangout.
I thought you might want a drink?
We could stop at the Hilton by the airport.
It's kind of a sports bar
Why does it need to be dark?
Great.
I am. Have a seat.
Why?
No thanks. There's gotta be other ways to get it out.
I'm helping him bring his money into America. He loves the idea. You just missed him.
Yeah, we were goin' over everything. That's why all the bags.
I know, I got your message. Ray wanted to have dinner. He wanted to talk about the sting we're plotting. That's what he calls it. A sting. He's being real nice to me.
Maybe. But I'm thinking it might be something like he wants the money for himself.
He's setting me up to make a proposition.
You don't propose something like that unless you're pretty sure the other person's into it.
Not really. But I knew this narcotics cop one time. Told me that in a raid, the whole package never gets back to the station. His exact words.
He weren't bullshittin' either, 'cause later he was suspended and forced to retire.
Don't be so literal. Ray believed it.
Well, you know I'm not going to show him the whole amount. He'll see fifty thousand.
In the bag underneath.
He won't -- I mean, he didn't the last time. He'll be expecting fifty thousand and there it is -- on top.
Not really. If he finds it, I say Mr. Walker put the money in, and I didn't know nothing about it. Like the coke.
Yeah, but I'm not in jail and I tried.
That's why you don't make a move till I come out of the fitting room.
Well, a suit. There's one I had my eye on.
I didn't say you did.
I know.
I'm fifty-five-years old. I can't blame anybody for anything I do.
What the fuck is that shit?
You planted that shit on me.
Ever meet her, or they talk about her?
Who's the other one?
What's her story?
And splittin' with her?
What did you say?
She told you that?
Was she there?
But she mentioned Beaumont by name?
Well, this sounds like a lady I'd like to have a word with. So everything's set for tomorrow?
Better get me another Sam's.  Join me in a Jaeger shot?
Gimme one anyway.
Sure.
Shut your raggedy ass up and sit down.
It's true, isn't it?
They know I'm delivering for you. I mention the half-million -- they don't give a fuck about that -- They want you with guns. So I say, well, if you want proof he's getting paid for selling them, let me bring the money in.
Max Cherry? You and him friends now? You tell him about this shit?
No.
Detroit.
We had done time together already.
We shoulda been there already and we woulda been if it hadn't been for your fuckin' around!
That's good money.
Then what?
Yep.
Well, why the fuck keep her around?
Why do you let someone know your business you can't trust?
What does that mean?
What?
Tell me.
You gonna tell me who it was?
You think you could do that?
Mister Robbie, isn't it? I have the ten thousand you put up. Isn't that why you called.
You know it's for you.
No! That was years ago! I've lived years since then.
No! The army did this to me! They've done something to my brain.  Jezzie! I want my boys! Sarah! I'm not dead! I want my family!
I could have told you that.
You need ... a doctor.
Okay, not you Rod. But the rest of us are flipping out for some goddamn reason. They're tryin' to kill us. Fuck it man, we need to find out what's going on.
I haven't seen her in months.
I'm with another woman now. We're both with the post office, Midtown, 34th Street branch.
Oh, you'd be surprised. They just don't have their doctorates, that's all.
Oh, that goes way back. They had a hiring freeze, one of those last min- ute things. Bad timing for me though. Middle of the war. The draft.  I'll tell you Prof, after Viet Nam ... I didn't want to think anymore. I decided my brain was just too small an organ to comprehend this chaos.
I doubt it's my mind that interests her. I tell you Prof, she's a fiery lady.
No. Of course you're not. You've just hurt your back. That's all. You're going to be fine. It'll just take some time.
Your kid dropped it off.
No. The little one.
They're weird names.
Well, personally, I never went for church names.
I don't let anybody call me that.
You sold your soul, remember? That's what you told me.
A good lay.
The best.
Jake, you are never out of your head!
Pictures. Your wife was gonna toss 'em so "what's his name" brought 'em over on his way to school.
I wanna leave. Get me out of here.
Where are we?
Where?
Where's Della? Bring her here?
Show me Della!
Here. I'll do it.
A chemist. Part of a chemical warfare unit out of Saigon. He said he knows me and that I'll know him when I see him.
I have no idea.  I was right. There were experiments. I knew it. I knew it. My God.
Hold me, Jezzie. Hold me.
A couple of days later. It was fierce. You guys never saw it.
Yeah. But not with the Cong.
They're awfully heavy.
Where am I?
I'm awake?
Where's Sarah? Where did she go?  She was here ...
That's a lie. My family was here.
Last night! They were as real as you are!
I'm looking for Dr. Carlson. Isn't this his office?
Yeah yeah I better call the labs, see what the hell is going on.
If we don't sever the hull completely she'll drag us down with her.
Get out of here!
The hull's imploding!
We could convert fission transistors.
Not so fast Yllo! There's a protocol here.
wHAT'S My status?! I've lost three men and your worthless fuck! After I kill this asshole I'm coming your Yllo!
Negative.
Yeah, that's it, scare the hell out of here, that'll work.
And what happend to ...?
I'm stuck!
She's obviously dealt with this guy before.
Forget her, she's a pain in the ass. Let her hang there.
Just get us to the ship!
Oh my God! Adrienne?
You need to get laid!
Yes, I've reprogrammed you. You are very brave. Bad ass.
Ssh.
JASON?! WHERE IS HE?!
Three...two...one...
I'm all checked out for light surf and look at it.
Dad, the ponds are for old ladies.
Sure, Dad.
What I do is trick him to the surface, got that? Then I can jab him, understand?  Think I'm gonna haul it in as if he's a catfish, like everyone else does?
Have you ever had one do this?
Here? You gotta be kiddin'.
You going to be all right?
I'll see you back soon. There's an extra pair of glasses in your black socks, and there's some suntan lotion and blistex in your kit.
Be reasonable, boys -- this isn't the time or the place to do some kind of half-assed autopsy on a fish. Ben...  do you have all the pictures you need?
Swell.
Why don't we just tow it in?
Be careful, for chrissake.
No...  You think we can get back with those?
What's going on with the beaches, Chief?
This is Quint, Missus.
He's busy.
Just fine, Missus. We'll be back soon. Everything's fine. We haven't seen anything yet. Orca out.
Real fine stuff but it won't mean a thing to Mr. Whitey, of course... he didn't go to schools in electronics. He was born with what he does best. Eat. He's a swimming appetite. 'Course he might eat this stuff, but then I've seen him eat a rocking chair, too.  Next time, ask me.
Nothing! A pleasure scar. Look here --
Look, maybe this is the wrong time to pursue this, but I'm not sure...
But you copy my work every week.
I don't mind. You definitely bring something to the table.
Or something.
Your mom must be really glad you're not taking me.
I'm not mad. I'm in a fucking great mood. Despite the fact that I'm trapped in a fat suit I can't take off, despite the fact that everyone is making fun of me behind my back, despite the fact that your little girlfriend gave me the stinkeye in art class yesterday...
No... I guess not.
Excuse me?
I'm an ultrasound technician, ma'am.
What are you talking about?
Yeah, because you're allergic to their saliva. I've made a lot of sacrifices for you, Juno. And in a couple years you're going to move out -- and I'm getting Weimaraners.
Oh, go fly a kite.
Technically, that would be kickin' it Old Testament.
You're kidding!
I came over as soon as I got that cold ultrasound goo off my pelvis. My stepmom verbally abused the ultrasound tech so we were escorted off the premises.
Most Fruitful Yuki is bad ass, man. You should be proud to be the same condition.
Sure.
Doesn't it look like it's waving? It's kind of like it's saying "Hi, Vanessa. Will you be my mommy?"
Your name, please?
Once! And she didn't die, if you recall!
I don't know. It's not... seasoned yet. Wait. Huh. Yeah, there's that pink plus sign again. God, it's unholy.
I'm pregnant.
Almost eight. You wouldn't believe how weird I look naked.
Trust me, you don't. I actually have to wear a bra now. And I have to rub this nasty cocoa butter stuff all over myself or my skin could get stretched too far and explode.
They're yellow.
Why do people think yellow is gender- neutral? I don't know one man with a yellow bedroom.
Or you could just wait a couple months. It's not like the baby's going to storm in here any second and demand dessert-colored walls.
Nesting, huh? Are you planning to build the crib out of twigs and saliva?
I just think it's too early to paint. That's my opinion.
I suppose anything's possible.
So you don't do any of those things.
What's Early been in jail for?
...Anything else?
Jeez... Adele!
Yeah I left him with the car... We're all squared up now.
I changed my mind, Early. I'm not gonna climb up that Hollywood sign with you... I decided. I think your mean, and you hurt people.
It's just a work in progress, kinda rough.
Who?
Henry Lee Lucas. Well he was only convicted of killing eleven but he claimed to have killed over three hundred.
Two brothers, prospectors, lived here. Up until a few years back.
...I think it's the best stuff I've done.
You try, I'm gonna pretend they're with somebody else.
I don't want to talk about it.
What the fuck is wrong with you Brian!? If you'll stop taking notes for once and open your eyes... you'll see that he is a homicidal fucking killer. He is... for real!
No.
I ain't got nothing against God. It's the people he let come into the world... lot of them should have been stopped at the door. What are you looking for?
You fucked it?
Yeah.
A little bit. But I didn't really want her to.
I don't know. That's too easy. I mean getting a virgin to suck your dick. That's so easy.
I want to knock her guard down. I mean there's a whole philosophy behind it. Having a virgin suck your dick, that's basic because there's nothing lost.
Right. But when you deflower a girl, that's it. You did it. You were the one. No one else can ever do it.
Yep.
I guess so. I gotta stop off home too.
Why not? You stink.
Come on nigga. Sup, sup then? Stop faking moves.
I think you're like the best girl I've ever kissed.
Do you care about me?
Everything is wrong.
Yeah, I guess so.
No.
No.
Mine?
It's like yeah whatever. But when you fuck. You wanna fuck that person. You're like ripping each other's hair out. Ooooh.
Did they ask you a lot of questions?
I don't know, eight or nine.
Everywhere. Fuckin' flophouse. We're still short on the rent. If you want, you and Casper can move in. You guys can share the bathtub.
Yes.
You don't have an investigation without me.  You got that?
Sit down!
Yeah, I am.  I think he's playing us. If I was a killer and the police were trying to make a case against me, what better why to draw them off than to put their attention on someone else?
But a hundred men could move him.
Do you know what I'm doing right now, Peter?  I'm looking at the name of the girl I'm going to kill tonight.
Not really.
Because she's the type.
I know what I said!  She looks just like...
I really wish you'd stop trying to maneuver me.  I find it irritating, not to mention insulting.
You're not playing very well.  There are clues all around you and you keep missing them.
You sonofabitch!
If you kill tonight and I'm in jail the police will know I'm innocent.
I've figured out the message.
Can we correlate data?  Look for specific things, like player's ages... stuff like that?
Okay.  Run a search to see if there are any players with a rating above two thousand that live on the Island.
I just can't believe it.
How come the police never had a record of Sanderson before.  This doesn't come out of nowhere, there has to be a history.
I can't sleep.  My beds lumpy.
That has nothing to do with it.
Okay.
That's great.
Call dispatch.  Double the patrols.  I want that area blanketed.
We're going to work on the message.
The most logical choice.
"Wee Willie Winkie runs though the street."  We think he might be making a reference to himself.
Upstairs and downstairs in his night gown -- He could be saying the house he's picked is two stories.
Are we going to go through this again?
I went out.
Mate in five.
Nothing.  I just came in for a steam.
You know, Andy thinks you're doing this.
No.
Because I think he's wrong.
The line was busy.  I'll try again.
It could be anything.
Never mind my ears! Go away!
Move quickly. We are coming for you. We are in the Fortress.
You have rope?
You won't have to.
He thinks you betray him with Lyssa.  Colwyn! The waters deceive you!
We must enter the swamp.
What business?
Not sleepy, either?
Colwyn, don't be a fool. You can't do battle with that thing.
Smart lad.  Bring me my spices!
The greatest boon of your otherwise worthless life, blockhead, is the privilege of dining on boar roasted by the hand of Ergo the Magnificent.
He will not come. You will be my queen.
Yes. It is the Western Ocean.
It is not necessary. They will not follow.
You cannot stop time. Go now, before it runs out.
There is sand enough for only one life. Go now, save the other.
I'll explain you, Leon: they'll ask you to fill in a lot of forms and you can't write and they'll ask you your job, your employer's name and you can't tell them: My job, I'm a hitman and my employer is Tony, his record is longer than his resturant's menu.  That's why you can't have a bank account!
Yes, yes...
Why?
That wasn't bullshit, I said we love each other.
...Don't you like me?
Good morning, Mister... It's Danielle!
...I got lost, Mister.
It's not me, it's dark here... and I can't find the switch.
Yeah... And still in Messina.  He's my uncle.
No... Dino's.
High-top Nike Cross-Trainers with heel support and air-cushioned soles.  They're nasty.
Put out a P.B.S.... Or whatever it's called.
Sergeant, I'm a psychologist and I know the difference between normal whims people have and actions that clearly display psychological problems... My uncle lost his wife and it devastated him.
I think my uncle is suffering from a condition called Mania which is linked with depression.  It is a time when an individual will act over-confident, and will act out impractical, grandiose plans. Sometimes these plans can be dangerous.
A couple days to a few months if untreated.
You do?
You have?
Okay.
No.  How far in one attempt -- what's the farthest someone like myself could walk?
You're talking to me?
He's plastered.
No it's not.  He should be here with me now, not trying to find some fucking bottle of Johnny Walker.  He's never been there for me.  I've always been alone.
His name is Maurice.  He's dancing around everything else.
If he's in trouble with the law -- fine.  Not our problem.  He yanked two people from a car wreck, let's give him some space.
You know what... maybe I ran onto the field and hit a home run.
Never have children.  If they're not a burden to you, they're a burden to someone else.
I said, 'I would do anything for her'... and she didn't believe me. I said, 'I'd walk across the country for her'... she didn't believe me.
It's mine to risk.
Forty-seven years.
That's funny.  I wonder if you'll take two hundred and fifty dollars to fuck me?
To death?
I like hearing you talk.  If you feel up to a short walk, there's a place to eat around the corner. All the food in Vegas is terrible so the place doesn't really matter. How does that sound to you?
Seriously, Ben... I need to keep pretty low-key around here. Maybe next time you could nap this side of the door. That was the landlord.
Very well... umm... I never expected to have to ask you this again... but how did our evening go? I remember getting to the casino... I remember kissing you... that was really nice but everything after that is a blank.
Oh, and what did you do?
That's impressive. How did you do that?
We?
Let's stay for a while.
Sorry. Look... you seem like a nice girl. I'm just sick of everyone in this town trying to get my money.
No.
You took my class in LA. You had the best high kick I've ever seen. Are you one of my lawyers?
No. I was in the shower.
I guess.
Yes. But I can't tell you what it is.
I saw Mrs. Windham standing over the body of Mr. Windham.
No, she was crying her eyes out.
Spill.
Trust me. You've got the equipment, you just need to read the manual.
Really?
So?
Did she do that to you, too?
Neat.
We're here from Austen, Platt, Jaret & Donovan --
I'm quitting.
What, like on va-kay?
She was a Delta Gamma! Not in my pledge class or anything -- she graduated five years ahead of me. But I used to take her class at the LA Sports Club. She's amazing!
How can it be the right thing if we're not together?
So you're breaking up with me because you're afraid your family won't like me?  Everybody likes me!
Just because I'm not a Vanderbilt, all of a sudden I'm white trash? I grew up in Bel Air, Warner! Across the street from Aaron Spelling! I think most people would agree that's way better than a Vanderbilt --
I'm seriously in love with you -- Isn't that enough?
See?
It's not a Theta --
I have something far more pleasant awaiting me.
Do it now!
No more listening!  Your time is at an end, insignificant whelp!
It looks... er, delicious...  Such a fine bouquet... very aromatic...
Well... I... I don't want to be rude, but... it's generally known that --
Please don't misunderstand.  I am grateful for your hospitality and --
Better we eat him than the other way round.
Send Oona up above the tree tops. She be our eyes.
Dwarves be very sensitive about their feet.
Very secretive, they are.  Keep their feet covered up.  Best if you don't mention it.
No, thank the Lord, but she be sore envenomed by the spider's bite.
We'll find it.
Heading true north.  We continue in that direction.
We'll trust in faith, Gump.
We'll need more siege machinery and longer scaling ladders.
We do both.  Our frontal attack a diversion whilst we drive a tunnel under...
Patience, lad.
Hush up, Screwball.  Do your own worm-sticking if you like the taste so well.
Rise, Screwball, and into the basket with you.
Shhh!
In these woods you are a commoner. Now be quiet.  True royalty approaches.
You've freed me, Jack...
No... it's not you he's afraid of, it's... light...
Sunlight... It destroys him.
That's why he goes masked during the day...
In the dark... where I join him...
And I... love you...
Couer de Noir!  A demon if the Devil ever made one.
That would be the Baron's way. There'll be no light or life in the world until the alicorn is taken from him and he vanquished.
You'll need the fastest steed alive, for Couer de Noir's castle rests at the very edge of the earth.  Only the sharpest sword and the golden armor of Achilles will protect you from his fury.
Follow the raven in her flight, Follow old black wing to the edge of night...
Come sit beside me, sweet boy, and I'll draw you a map.
Ask away, sweet man.
Princess?  I know of no princess.
Is she fair, this princess?
As fair as me?
She's dead!
Dead, dead, dead.
Far as you're concerned she's dead, believe it or not.
Heading north still?
Haven't heard a bird sing in days...
Yes, yes... Jimmy Squarefoot good friend to one and all...
We did a lot of the wiring too.
I don't think Dad wants you home.
Who are all these people?
Maybe your tongue...I don't know, my mouth is numb.  Why did you do that?
I can use your mom's.
If he tricked me into loving him, is what I meant.
Not if what he left me was real.
He builds models for architects.  His dad, on the other hand, was the real deal.  Designed and built the coolest houses I've ever seen.
He buys and sells the world.
I did tell you, didn't I?  That I'd be ready to start the Berlin model today?
Uh huh.
I'm sorry.
Not a shower.
To check up on me?
Why would you be there?
You live in Cory's parents' cabin?
No you don't.
My dad used to play a game.  I never really understood what it was until after he was gone.
I was just thinking about my mom.  She wouldn't leave him.  I remember one time she made us dinner wearing sunglasses.  I mean it was dark outside and in.  But we never talked about it.
To hide a black eye.
I think she was terrified of living with him...but maybe even more terrified of life without him.
Everything would have been better if you had.  You'd have liked your grandmother. And there'd be a girl out there that'd have her mother.  I remember reading about her in the paper.  They couldn't find her father and her mother was dead. I still feel guilty about that.
Good for you.
Check the permits.  It was built as a guesthouse.  It's a legally rentable unit grandfathered when South Laguna was incorporated.
Why does he have a lock on his door?
Well, for later then.
My stupid back.
I'd rather you not be here.
Not a perfect day.
Is Lois still here?  I'm starved.
What are you doing home?
Why?
Can we really help build a house?
What am I gonna do out there, Ray? I can't go home to my mama like this. I'll get the strap for sure.
It's a hell of a lot longer when you're innocent.
You have to forgive me if I don't laugh.
I was hoping you were gonna say an engagement ring, Claude.
I don't see where that's any of your business.
Hey, man, don't ever call me that.
Shut up. It's too damn hot. What do you know, anyway?
Claude.
What do you want, Claude?
My daddy always said when a man starts talking about the weather keep you hand on your wallet.
Cut the bullshit. What do you want, Claude?
Yeah.
We? Did I hear you say we? As I recall, you're the one who said there is no we. Guess we got some bad news in that letter, huh?
On your behalf. What happened to we?
Well, let's just think about that for a moment. He's a successful lawyer up in New York City and you're down here with a bright future in the cotton picking business. Eeny, meeny, miney, Maynard.
You know what, Claude? This whole time we've been down here, you've done nothing but think about yourself, acting like this whole thing is my fault. That plan with your cousin, did that include me?
Hell, yes, Yankee Stadium. Bombers are playing a double-header against the Red Sox.
I don't know. Who do you want?
Sure, it says Allie Reynolds right here in the program. He's warming up right now. Man, we're so close to the field I need cleats. How'd you get such good seats?
They must be the right people. Whoa, there goes the hot dog man. Let's get a couple. Damn, that smells good. Nothing like a ballpark hot dog, huh?
Ketchup? Who eats ketchup on a hot dog? Mustard's what you want.
Make 'em throw strikes.
What the hell are you doing in that trunk?!
I ain't escaping! We're picking up the new super just like I told you.
You ain't getting out of that trunk.
Go where, Ray?
And what will we do when we get there? I'm sixty-five years old, Ray. So are you. What are we gonna do out here? Get married, have kids, settle down? That boat sailed without us, man.
Forget about that. You run if you want to, but you're not taking this car.
I ain't spending a month in the hole so you can take a joy ride.
Hey, there's Wilkins!
Why the hell not?
Grandma Dodi's Pork Rib Joint.
You heard what the man said! Move it!
Hell, no! I just got something in my eye.
Don't say that, Rayford. Don't ever say that. He gave up hope. That's where you gotta be different.
I gave you life. And they can't take it away from you. Remember that. You'll get outta here someday. I believe that. You gotta believe it, too.
Are you offering me a bribe?
You may be able to buy your way out of trouble up in New York City, but down here we take murder seriously.
Greenville, that the nearest town?
But you do. What does that say about you, Ray? What does that say about me? I've given you a lot of leeway over the years on account of your father. But he didn't last long enough to teach you the meaning of the word respect so I guess I'm gonna have to school you myself.
Hey, that's Dad's throne! How did Adrian get that? Is Dad okay?
I was going to let you out, eventually, Cassius. I swear.
You know, we saw you save your girlfriend's life.
She's so nice.
That turn you on there, RuPaul?
What can I do about it?
Nobody's as evil as my brothers. Those dudes put the wick in wicked.
But those are my roommate's sodas...
Now he's got no ears! You happy, Nicky? Your father's got no ears!
So go get 'em, Dad!
Beast.
Oh, would you grow up.
We know where to find Nicky.
Dude. Seriously?
Sometimes, sure.
East Rutherford.
Why? Did she hurt you? Do you miss her? Need a shoulder to cry on?
You walked in. I saw you. Don't you remember?
I don't care... Just get it over with.
What an old, old man you're getting to be, Francis. Weren't you ever a Yellow? I bet you were even wilder than --  come on, Sandman.
...and he was hunting the first one, this one. Wasn't he? Wasn't he? This one was running, the other one was hunting him...
I'm going to run.
You know something.
Both... running's what I'm interested in.
It's different now. Help me.
Yes.  I don't know what else to do -- with him following us.  Why do you keep running from your --
He's good, isn't he?
They won't believe us.
They won't listen.
We'll convince them.
Why don't we rest here? We know we can eat these.
He had a mother and father -- and he knew them.
All this. All of it.
I don't know... but it does.
What makes you think so?
Mother and -- ? You knew your mother and father?
Thank you.  Tell me -- what do those words mean? "Beloved husband"... "Beloved son"... "Beloved wife"...
Stay? They lived together all their years?
No, I'm okay.
What is?
Yeah... Laurent.
I used to.
Up the stairs - down the hall.
Yes, there was a man with you... She brought you here... She didn't know what else to do.
Nothing, Marsh. Vanished. There's an APB out on him. His photo's been faxed nationwide.
Nothin'.
No... There is, I mean, I use it as a practice room... it's soundproofed.
A videotape.
I don't know... There's no return address on the envelope... In fact, there's no address on it.
No, nothing.
I wish I knew.
Do they aim for the head or for the heart?
I wouldn't... The brain would know what's going on. Your heart would be ripped open trying to pump blood, blood pouring into the chest cavity. Savage pain, Marian.
What?
Sure. Sure I do.
Yes. Might as well - all of it.
I'll dispatch a convoy to meet him.
Okay, brother.
Okay, sister.  No offense. No offense!
That's what they do with cattle just before the slaughter. Fatten them.
Please don't call me Lovey.
So that's where you are. I might of known it. No wonder you couldn't hear me.
And be poisoned out here in the open?
All right, I will! I'll let my hair down! Why not? It can't make any real difference now.  Hey Lovey, were you ever chased by the police?
Leaving?
When are you going to start?
I think I'll stick around. I'll leave with the porters on their next trip.
Well - I'm
Well, no. You see, I got this plumbing business
Oh, no - you don't want to go yet, honey.  She'll stick around too.  Is that right?
Our Valley is very rich in a metal called gold, which fortunately for us is valued very highly in the outside world. So we merely . . .
Buy and - sell? No, no, pardon me, exchange .
That, my dear Conway, is the story of a remarkable man.
A Belgian priest by the name of Father Perrault, the first European to find this place, and a very great man indeed. He is responsible for everything you see here. He built Shangri-La, taught our natives, and began our collection of art. In fact, Shangri-La is Father Perrault.
Oh, let me see - way back in 1713, I think it was, that Father Perrault stumbled into the Valley, half frozen to death. It was typical of the man that, one leg being frozen, and of course there being no doctors here, he amputated the leg himself.
Yes. Oddly enough, later, when he had learned to understand their language, the natives told him he could have saved his leg. It would have healed without amputation.
Yes, yes. They were very sincere about it too. You see, a perfect body in perfect health is the rule here. They've never known anything different. So what was true for them they thought would naturally be true for anyone else living here.
Rather astonishingly so, yes. And particularly so in the case of Father Perrault himself. Do you know when he and the natives were finished building Shangri-La, he was 108 years old and still very active, in spite of only having one leg?
You're startled?
Forgive me. I should have told you it is quite common here to live to a very ripe old age. Climate, diet, mountain water, you might say. But we like to believe it is the absence of struggle in the way we live. In your countries, on the other hand, how often do you hear the expression, "He worried himself to death?" or, "This thing or that killed him?"
And very true. Your lives are therefore, as a rule, shorter, not so much by natural death as by indirect suicide.
Why, Mr. Conway, you surprise me!
I mean, your amazement. I could have understood it in any of your companions, but you - who have dreamed and written so much about better worlds. Or is it that you fail to recognize one of your own dreams when you see it?
Then everything is quite all right, isn't it?
Yes.
You've very kind Mr. Lovett.
Oh, I'm so glad.
Why, no.
Now, what would you like to do?
Splendid!
I'm sure you were. When would you like to start?
Then it's done.
Thank you.
Are you the High Lama?
Come on! Quick! This way.
It looks like it.  Smell those fumes?
George. George - do you mind? I'm sorry, but I can't talk about it tonight.
I don't believe it! I can't believe it. She's lying.  You're lying. You're lying! Every word you've been saying is a lie! Come on, say it!
Where are we going? Huh?
All of it. Father Perrault and his magnificent history. This place, hidden away from the rest of the world, with its glorious concepts, and now you come along and confuse me entirely.
On the contrary, you're not strange. And that in itself is confusing. I have the same idea about Shangri- La. The sense that I've been here before, that I belong here.
I can't quite explain it, but everything is somehow familiar. The very air that I breathe. The Lamasery, with its feet rooted in the good earth of this fertile valley, while its head explores the eternal. All the beautiful things I see, these cherry blossoms, you - all somehow familiar.  I've been kidnapped and brought here against my will. A crime, a great crime, yet I accept it amiably, with the same warm amiability one tolerates only from a very dear and close friend. Why? Can you tell me why?
I wonder.
Then it wouldn't be a garden spot for long.
The first thing we want to do is to cable the Foreign Office. All of England is waiting to hear about my brother. There's a cruiser at Shanghai ready to take him back.
What the hell...
I guess I lost:
Yes, air? -- OOOMPH.
Oh yeah?  The hell you weren't. Little pither just out of school...
I understand.  Hey, it works for the Hasids, right?  No one recognizes them.
I guess it's simple, huh?  They're either gone... or dead.
A what?
The Pentagon.
All of it?
Me, too.  I feel a long day coming on.
What do we do?    Lean into it.
Actually... I don't know.
Give or take.  It was right around your civil war, I think, when I was here last.  We were waiting till your planet was warm enough.
This guy.  Where was he?
So whattya say, kid?  You in or out?
Don't tell me.  Insects.
He'll turn around.
Oh, Jesus...
Baltimore.  Eastside.  Solomon P. Eddie M.D.  I was a plastic surgeon.
I work graveyard, swing and day all by my lonesome.
I understand.  Sir.
Beauty?  The precogs don't even always agree with each other!
No maglev system.
Georgetown.
Your secretaries were all kind enough to give me a look around the office...
I'll write the paranoia off to the whiff you been doping on all night.
Okay.  Fine.  Where the hell is that?
What a big boy.  How old are you?
NO!
You can tell me how someone... could fake a prevision.
No, it isn't, Lamar.  There was nothing anyone could do.
My God...
I know.  He came to me, told me about the missing data stream.  He was concerned that you might find it.
Danny, tell me what you're thinking.
How?
I'm sure you've all grasped the legalistic drawback to precrime methodology.
How many?
I know who you are.
You don't understand... they're a hive mind.  It takes all three for their predictive abilities to work.
Maybe if he'd taken one of the males.  But the female, she's the key.  She's the one they listen to, the one with the most talent.  The one who takes care of the other two.
Somebody's getting comfortable.
You gonna bust my horns, or you want spaghetti
How could you let her see this?
Just so you know, I bought you out with Maxie. I suggest you leave while you can.
Tell you the truth, I don't give a shit for me. But that little girl is so special, and you're gonna fuck her up.
It's bad. Before you even showed up, he said you were Maxie's 'token goons', and not to be trusted. He wanted to TCB alone. I was gonna ride shotgun to keep the English dude above board. Now he's spooked. This shit's snowballing.
Was gonna be tomorrow morning. Now, who knows?
Yeah.
Where's the drop?
Excuse me, we need to make a call.
It's important.
Listen, man, we really gotta...
Shhh...  Yeah, yeah... No. No. I'll be there.  You gotta get me to the Magic Castle at four.
I tried your ATM PIN. I gotta kill an hour. Let's grab a beer.
You sure?
So we're working?
You want us strapped, don't you?
And you grew up in Manhattan?
What do you mean 'kinda?'
Drinks are free, right?
Yes.
Ruiz? Oh, he ain't here.
Nah, see, Maxie just asked him to set that shit up as a favor. He, you know, he tied in with the club. Set us up so, you know, you feel at home.
Well, he ain't gonna be around no more.
You think this shit's funny, Ho?
You think it's funny, motherfucker?
We're going to New York?
And the money. Where do we bring the money?
And where do we bring it?
Outfit? What's he talking about?
Man's rep travels.
Nnnnnnn!
That really you, Red?
Man, I don't want to hear all that.
A black man playing big league ball is something.
Mr. X, I was out there tonight. I saw what you did. I want to be a Muslim. I ain't never seen a Negro stand up to the police like that.
Shall I tell my sisters that we oppose marriage?
What do you think?
I'm tired of praying.
Please, go ahead.
For the white man to ask the black man if he hates him is just like the rapist asking the raped, or the wolf asking the sheep, "Do you hate me!" The white man is in no moral position to accuse anyone of hate.
Not yet. But the way things going, that boy gonna turn her out any day.
Please make way, please --
Baby, I got to let this old man win. Keep the faith, and tell Billie I'll see her later.
You the man!
Watch your tongue, boy.
Off the top of my head, I don't know what they could've been.
I show, you give me the information?
Where?
[Do you know who I am?]
[Listen! I will give you a life for a life.]
[Her life for your life.]
It's loaded.
A bodyguard has to be close to someone all the time. Willing to talk. I'm not good at that.
Different door. Not far from here.
I'm not crying.
You need to practice.
The gunshot holds no fear.
I'm fine.
The food's fine. Sometimes I don't eat.
It's Creasy.
Los Arcos. Was a little girl kidnapped recently? About twelve maybe?
What was her name?
We'll see. And thank your father in the morning. A man always needs to be thanked.
I think it's fantastic.
[And left three more dead men.]
What?
Listen. You people go grab a table. I'll be back inna minute. I'll be right back.
I was gonna call that girl from last night. Take her to a movie tonight.
Listen, Angie, I wanna tell you, you were very impolite last night. I introduced you to the girl, you just turned and walked off. Now, why did you do that?
I keep one eye open when I sleep, because she's gonna come in, stab me in my bed.
Thank you.
Oh, I'm fine.
Maybe that would be a good idea.
Well, I don't know the people, of course, but as a rule, I don't think a mother-in-law should live with a young couple.
I don't think a mother should depend so much upon her children for her rewards in life.
It's silly of me to argue about it. I don't know the people involved.
That means he'd have to marry the girl when she was one year old.
Sure! Sure! It's gonna be nice! It's gonna be nice! I'll come over tonight to your house, and I talk with Catherine, and you see, everything is gonna work out all right.
I heard you, Ma.
She's twenty-nine, Ma.
Get ridda her. This is money inna bank.
This is a good deal here, Marty.
Siddown, Thomas, siddown.
Lemme tell it, Tommy.
We want you to do a very big favor for us, Aunt Theresa.
Well, sure, but I'm also worried about Walt Waldowski  Painless. His poker players got in an argument and asked him for a ruling, and he said what difference did it make, it was just a card game.
You fixing to add overtime to a twelve- hour day? The union ain't gonna like it.
Or her figger.
...No cases over the age of temptation but deliver us eight. from evil. For Thine is the kingdom, the power and...
Finest kind. We'll sit where we can get the best view.
Way we hear it, the Pride is supposed to have run up the highest lifetime batting average ever recorded in Wayne County.
Sure you have, only as 'Spearchucker' Jones.
Like the Spearchucker said, that's possible. Anyway, it's been an interesting association.
A football game?
But what about Major Houlihan?
N-n-no thanks, G-General.
All you have to do is ask.  The quarterback is saying they'll run the old Statue of Liberty. Their left end will come across and take the ball out of his hand and try to get around our left end.
You want it straight? Medical history records no instance of anyone taking this particular prescription and surviving.
And if it isn't, why don't we call Washington on your telephone? You tell your story, we'll tell ours.
They're coming.
We may be in trouble, I can't catch my breath. I've got the occupational disease of oversized ex-athletes.
Yes, I know. Hi, Ho-Jon. How did it go?
I'm sorry to hear that. You think he's unfit for military service?
Why would he do that?
Let's get his clothes off quick.
You can cut the bow.
That. It's out of the act.
Major Burns will be out of your tent in twenty-four hours.  Tell them Captain Pierce and Captain Forrest are on their way.
I'll tell you my news. I'm retiring from football.
What's that, Henry?
Nice.
Well, all those guys in the bleachers think
Against what?
You got me.
Oh, yuh did, huh?
Why can't you call right, you bone- headed, pig-eared, lop-eared, pot- bellied
Yeah, that's the one.
Well, don't say anything at all. Just sit down.
Look, Mr. Connell . . . I just can't afford to be without work right now, not even for a day. I've got a mother and two kid sisters to . . .
That's all, Ned. Thank you.
Take it easy, John Doe.
Oh, let me go, will you!
Oh, quiet, quiet, quiet.  Say, tell me something did you read that speech you're gonna make tonight?
I know why you're hangin' aroundyou're stuck on a girlthat's all a guy needs is to get hooked up with a woman.
Yeah? Well, you can have it!
Oh, you trust him, eh? Well, that's fine. I suppose he trusts you, too?
Why, D. B., you're not going to fall for
Okay. I just came in to get warm, myself. Come on, let's go.
Willoughby. John Willoughby, Long John Willoughby they called me in baseball.
You mean you'd like me to do it, huh?
SWAT wants to go in.
Yeah... Yeah... Now I can hear it.
Whoa!... The government. They control everybody's mind. You're too fucking stupid to know that?
You want a convertible or hardtop?
Yes, I do. That way there's no misunderstandings. I need to make sure no one's hurt, then we can take care of business.
You've got a lot of hard work ahead of you if you want to be a negotiator.
I don't really like to drink.
Well, if I have to, I have to.
So what do I say to this guy?
What? Bring somebody in so he can cut his nuts off?
Fine.
He's cutting down the visibility.
You don't know shit, and I suggest you leave.
Can I come in?
He was going nuts at the park. He met this very attractive poodle. They made plans to meet again next weekend.
Yeah, I could get used to this Paradise shit.
What?
Depends. What's up?
Define concern.
Yes, I believe he has --
About what?
Not my problem.
Unfinished business.
Perfect opportunity for you to demonstrate your continued worth.
But have them wait for me 'till they move in on him.
You've got the keys, send someone in --
Where?
Her?
This.  No point to it.
Because you'll never believe me.
Speed?
Ah... sure.
... Let's take a look over there.
Don't lose hope yet, Alpha!
We can take these guys!
WE'RE OUTTA HERE!
Look closer.
Tommy, you are the Falcon, Winged Lord of the Sky.
Ah, the old and doddering.  I'm going to SCOURGE their puny minds, reducing them to ZOMBIE'S. And then I'll put them to work rebuilding my empire.
How dare you?!  Nobody shuts up Rita but me!
I ain't no fuckin' kike!
And I ain't no nigger either!
That ain't exactly been the lucky spot lately.
Can't we get a couple whores over?
Long as Charlie says.
No. I'm here with you.
I'm doin' business here!
It's nothin'. I'm gettin' married.
No. We ain't even...
Guess I'm not a single type guy.
Come off it, Bugs.
He's trying to make it.
He'll know you were smart enough to stay away, Boss.
You know that if you come, we gotta invite Maranzano.
So he can talk to all the families behind your back? Maybe have his own meet at 3:00 AM under the goddamn boardwalk? No. You're too smart for a sucker play.
Come on, Charlie. We got business.
I found that out.
That's why I'm here.
Talk English. Okay? I did lousy at school.
That's just what I'm sick of. Everybody lookin' ta knock somebody off! Greedy for what you got. A bunch of fuckin' hogs at the trough.
Yeah. But he needs me alive.
I don't know. I guess it was...
Sad commentary, huh?
I want him to have every chance, Doctor. We can certainly give it...three months.
That's not going to stop his nightmare -
Kid, listen: <u>that's all I'm saying</u>. And you didn't hear it from me.
I had to park two blocks away. Is something -
Julie?... Hey, you <u>are</u> a looker.
You can't do this! You'll get in trouble!
How am I gonna get past the guards?
Stu? Stu? Let's not disturb the nice Reaper.
Let's not kick the nice Reaper's ass.
IT'S NOT WORKING.
Uh-huh?
That's the Satan's Disciples' New York headquarters.
I've never had any problem with them. People say it's the safest block in the East Village.  I just hope their motorcycles don't keep you up at night.
It's Marika.  Is Paula there?
Oh.  I thought today was Saturday.
It was done to stop me from talking about a section of the Appropriations Bill!
Yes! This was how I could be put out of the Senate and out of the way! They even *promised* me that if I--
Eight to five Little Boy Blue is plastered.
Yeah. What about the second act?
Wha--? Yes, sweetheart-- Wha--?
Yes, yes--phone, phone--  A--an outrage, pet--an outrage--I'll look into this--  Hello--Joe!--What!--No! Not really! Terrible!
Jim--if I fling a party man like Horace in the face of those angry committees--
Will you please tell me *exactly* what he's done?
Me! Jim--how--?
Y-yes, Jim.
Than what?
Emma! Will you *please*--?
Yeah, for the fifth time, Senator-- Washington.
The porter's got them. They're coming.
Boy! My head's like a balloon--for two whole days. I never knew there was so much American history.
"Boy Stuff." Why, printer's ink runs in your veins, Jeff. You're just like your father.
Even to the hat. Same old dreamer, too. One look at you and I can see him, back of his old roll top desk, hat and all, getting out his paper. Always kept his hat on his head so as to be ready to do battle. Clayton Smith, editor and publisher, and champion of lost causes.
You don't have to tell me Jeff. We were a team, the two of us, a struggling editor and a struggling lawyer. The twin champions of lost causes, they used to call us.
His last fight was his best, Jeff. He and his little four-page paper against that mining syndicate and all to defend the right of one small miner who stuck to his claim. You know, they tried everything, bribery, intimidation, then--well--
Shot in the back. I was there. I can see him at that old roll top desk, still with his hat on... still with his hat on...
No.
The gentleman has said repeatedly that he is speaking to the people of his State. He has been waiting, as he so fancifully puts it, for them to come marching here in droves. Would the gentleman be interested in knowing what those people have to say?
You mean--you tell these men--and Senator Paine what to do?
You're a liar!
Punch?
Well, then, I--I *thank* you, Miss Saunders! Nothing better could have happened--. Yes *sir*, Miss Saunders, we're going right ahead with it!
Why, the Bill--the Bill--to make a National Boys' Camp...
Sure! A Bill. Senator Paine and I decided it was the one way in the world I could make myself--
Yes. Sure. It was his idea. *I* should have been the one to think of it--
I know--but you--you're going to help.
Right.
Oh, but this one is so simple.
And with your help--
Oh, just a day--
Tonight.
Oh--dinner. Yes. Well, I'm hungry, too. I thought--maybe--we could have something brought in--you know, like big executives who eat off trays. You see, we've got to light into this and get it going--
How?
Committee, huh?
Why?
Why?
Yes, I see that.
Some committee's got it.
Calendar?
What's that?
The Steering Committee.
Yes. Sure. What's a Steering Committee?
*This* is.
We're over in the House.
Yes. Shall we start on it right now-- or order dinner first?
I said--shall we get started *now* or--
Saunders--!
Are you drunk?
The truth! Well, the man wants the truth! "What *is* truth?" asked so-and-so, and turned away!
Yes, sir--
Well--I can *manage*--
Yes--a camp bill that will never get beyond a first reading. So calm down, Chick--and--goodnight.
He did it.
I don't care to meet anybody until I get paid--come on--come on. One dollar each, please, for the Milk Fund.
Finally, there was only one answer to a man like him--the truth--which I rose and gave to this body!  Mr. President--he has told lie upon lie--every lie a desperate attempt to conceal his own guilt. And now, he is trying to blackmail this Senate-- as he tried to blackmail me! To prevent his expulsion, he would probably even try to hold up this Deficiency Bill--vital to the whole country--which must be passed immediately--*today*! *Anything*--to force you to clear his bad name and save his hide!  Gentlemen--I--I have no more patience with this--this *rascally* character. I apologize to this body for his appointment--I regret I had ever known him. I--I'm sick and tired of this contemptible young man and I refuse to listen to him any longer! I hope every member of this body feels as I do!
Yes. Elsie Taggart was the midwife.
He sure is.
Oh, did I? I'm sorry . . .
Uh-huh.
You have?
He sounds like a person worth while knowing.
No, I don't mind.
A girl?
We're not going out tonight.
I'll put you on another job. You need never see him again, eh?
Oh, as bad as that, huh?
But what if they fall into somebody else's hands, why - uh
But a half million dollars! My goodness, where are we going to get
Let me go! I wanna see him!
I wanna see that guy!
Let me go!
But your honor
Make three reservations on the first train out to Mandrake Falls, Vermont.
Mandrake Falls.  M-A-N
Oh, I wasn't worried about that.
I was wondering where they're going to get another tuba player for the band.
I don't think we've got any suitcases.
Will you tell the gentleman I'm not in?
I guess it is. But I personally wouldn't care to be head of a business that kept losing money. That wouldn't be common sense. Incidentally, where is the $180,000 coming from?
Me?!
Excuse me, gentlemen, there's nothing natural about that .
What about it, Mr. Deeds?
No, I mean - about my client.
Yeah, what if I am? What about it?
I write poetry.
I'm kind of nervous. I've never been away from Mandrake Falls in my life. Kind of like to see Grant's Tomb, though.
Every man to his taste, sir.
Well, sir, he sometimes had as many as twenty in the house at the same time.
That was something I was never able to find out, sir.
You try it.
Yeah.
"There's no shame in getting a little therapy", right, Doc?
It could happen. What about his state certification exams? The records seem to be in order.
What kind of doubts?
What exactly is it supposed to do?
-- I find it degrading. Maximum gynecology and minimum turn-on --
-- Which I don't necessarily agree.
I've had my moments.
I thought it was -- Nobody ever said, "I should have spent more time at the office."
What do you do?
We've been talking about her, mostly.
You've done well.
My patient had to leave early.
...so accomplished.
Thanks for your help, Lionel.
What do you mean?
No, I really don't.
Why don't you tell me?
I don't think I can afford it. I don't want my dad paying.
Did you get headaches before this?  But you get more now? Or more severe?
So the headaches may not even be a part of this?
Of course.
What?
I don't know. Depends. I'm in a bad mood.
Do you think that's what he wants?
This is exactly what I wanted.
You'd be surprised. Most guys have kids or wives or girlfriends. They're busy. It's not as easy as you think.
Well, you know... that's the thing. Like I said, just about everybody in town works for me. And it's just not the same asking someone to throw a ball when they work for you. It's like an order or something... And no one -- no one -- asks me.
You are Panda, monarch of modems.
Okay... let's say that, for now.
Holy shit!
You want my advice? Far out!
I don't even know why hang-gliding is considered a legitimate sport.
In the desert? What for?
Just looking for you, O'Connell! I wanted to be with my friend!
Intestines.
You will not believe it.
I did not know, so when I heard you were coming, I asked him that myself.
He said... he was just looking for a good time.
Because that's where I found it. I was there.
And the fact that they say it's made out of pure gold, makes no nevermind to you, right?
Quarried granite with a cobalt lining.
Very slowly.
I have no choice.
Way to go, Evy.
Oh.
OWCH! That's really got to hurt.
And now he's going to use it to bring his girlfriend back
Fantasizing... about you.
And some sandwiches --
They'll think we're just a bunch of weirdoes.
Well, I give to the United Way, and I feel that sort of covers --
Frankenstein!
Or you'll what? CAN ME?
Monica, where are you?
When are you going to take off that mask?
Yeah.
What a jerk -- and like nobody knows who he really is!
Are you serious? This is the break we've been waiting for!
Yes.
Oh hi, Mom.
Looking for... the TV Guide.
Shut up.
But we gotta find out what's going on in there.
I, personally, am convinced that he will withdraw his army from Moscow, and attempt to establish himself in Poland for the winter.  In the end, he will not allow himself to be cut off from Paris.  But I believe that if he is offered any encouragement, by Your Majesty, he will postpone this decision as long as possible. He is a gambler and he will trust to his luck.
It is a terrible shock.
A glass of champagne, please.
Yes, I am.
Oh -- where do you come from?
Ajaccio.
I very much doubt that he will.
I'm afraid he has been rather upset by the outcome of the battle.
No...
No.
Of course.
No.
Yes.
One had better legs.
Yes.  They were the easiest.  I made love to one of them within ten minutes of our first meeting.
Not in the least.  After all, what is adultery -- only a brief transaction on a couch, requiring a few minutes of privacy.
I gave it to Berthier... this afternoon.
I thought he would be seeing you before I would, and would give it to you.
I'm sorry, I thought he would give it to you.
He's downstairs -- somewhere.
Oh, then you are...
Monsieur Varlac, I will count slowly to five, and if you have not begun to get down from the cart by then, I will carry out your execution, on the spot.
If the French army had been commanded at Jena and Auerstadt by a tailor, the King of Prussia would certainly have gained the day.
Why you say that?
Ain't the rest room this way?  I gotta pee.
Well get along with this one.  Go ahead of us.  Don't get seen and don't let that mutt out of your sight.
Cheeco.
Lay down, Day-Day.  Stop moving.
Okay, plan B.
Nothing.
That pump was full of money.  I saw where they put it.  Stay right here, I'mma climb in and go get it.
No, man, just wait.
So what?  Let's make'em wait.
Ya'll making me look like a punk.
Smokin' what?
Yeah, it was.  How you get up here?
You could sell your Beamer.
I don't know.
What?!  This look like a 7-11 or something?  Get the fuck outta here!
Keep pushing.
Shut yo' ass up.
What's he doing here?
What can I do for you Mr....Watson?
I would also like to apologize.
For not believing you.
Yes, I'm listening.
You fucked up.
Look...my daughter ... she's going to die...unless you can help me.
No way.
What's that? You have to speak up.  I'm a little deaf in this ear. Between that and my wooden leg I'm a mess. Compliments of the United States Army Artillery Corps.
I'll have you out of here in two shakes o'f a lamb's tail.
Don't think I won't.
You worthless piece of shit! Gimme that!
You're a big girl, huh?
Young love.
No.
He took the secret with him when I dropped him.
I been mindin' Pearl.
It's more fun hearin' stories in the dark.
Mr. Powell!  Willa has run away!
It's awful soon after Ben's passing.
John don't like him much.
The boy worries me. It's silly, but it's like there was something still between him and his Dad.
There's something else.
The money, Icey.
I would love to be satisfied Harry Powell don't think I've got that money somewhere.
I know you did, Reverend. Oh, I know how you tried!
You what?
Ssh...
Huh?
You ain't my Dad! You won't never be my Dad!
You think you can make me tell! But I won't! I won't! I won't!
Under the stone in the floor.
No.
Because John said I mustn't.
She'll not be back. I reckon I'd be safe in promisin' you that.
It's about that John and that Pearl?
Pearl and John.
Get the kit!
Uh-oh...
Don't ask -- just give me some help nailing this guy when I bring him out.
Nan, I --
Just tell me who did it and I'll go get him, baby.
How you know that?
Right.
So he's alive?
I told you.  It was dark, but I'm sure there was someone else IN there, under the covers with her.
I dreamed about this guy in a dirty red and yellow sweater; I dream in color, y'know; he walked into the room I was in, right, right through the wall, like it was smoke or something, and just stared at me. Sort of... obscenely. Then he walked out through the wall on the other side. Like he'd just come to check me out...
You should be more careful, Anna.
About what?
I haven't talked to anyone about Paris. I haven't said a word.
I have nothing to hide.
Or it might be the firing squad!
Where is your courage, Comrade Buljanoff?
That's right... and we might as well face it.
You didn't get legal advice?
I don't know how I can get you out of it this time. How will it end? What will happen to you?
Blue? Let's offset his mood. Find a striped one, and brighten it with a great blaze of tie.
Thank you, Louis.
It is Thursday!
My name is Count d'Algout. I telephoned.
I just want a word with Monsieur Mercier.
Two thousand francs.
A day.
A cow?
Yes, monsieur.
We did our best, Comrade.
The hearing is set for the twentieth of this month.
We did our utmost to have it set ahead.
Yes. It is unfortunate.
That's a strange angle.
The telephone is ringing.
But one of your friends may be in need of you. You must answer.
Foolish? If this dress were to walk down the boulevard all by itself I would follow it from one end of Paris to the other, and when I caught up with it I would say, "Just a moment, you charming little dress, I want you to meet Ninotchka... you two were meant for each other." Ninotchka feels more comfortable.
And General Savitzky.
Much happier.
The one I got they wouldn't let me read.  It began, "Ninotchka, my darling," and ended, "Yours, Leon."
Huh?
No.
I just couldn't sleep. I got up and went back... and then got up again. These last few days... whew!
Count d'Algout was for several years my personal representative and if it is necessary to sign any affidavit for him I'll be delighted.
Just in case they don't give you your visa to Russia I want you to know that I have signed a contract for my memoirs and rented a lovely little chteau in the Touraine, and if you feel the need of a change...
You were very careless with our precious jewels, my dear. They're too expensive a toy for two children to play with.
Don't worry. Fortunately last night a very trustworthy friend kept his eyes open. Perhaps he overstepped his function as a waiter but he fulfilled his duty as a Russian.  I just put this on for sentiment. The rest are absolutely safe. I assure you. But if you feel like notifying the police...
Won't it be rather embarrassing for a Soviet Envoy to disclose the circumstances under which she lost them?
That's very simple to answer. They were given to me by my mother. They were given to her by her mother, in fact they're mine, you cannot steal what belongs to you!
Can you recommend a restaurant?
Where do you eat?
Where is that?
Where is it?
"Ex-CIA"?  There's no such thing as "ex-CIA," John -- they're all Ivy League Establishment.  Is he one of these guys with a beef against us?
Yes ... I got the money.
I'll bet he would.
In Richard Nixon's long history of underhanded dealings, he has never gotten better value for his money.  If I were to open my mouth, all the dominoes would fall.
Find out what the hell he was doing at "CREEP."  This could be trouble. These CIA guys don't miss a trick. This could be a set-up.
Sir, there's dead American kids here. Let's say we don't apologize for Kent State, but maybe we could have a national prayer day ...
It's marked.  Also there's June twenty third.  And this year -- March twenty first.  Those are the ones ...
The hell he will!  Fire him, too.  If you have to go all the way down to the janitor at the Justice Department, fire the sonofabitch!  And ...
That fruitcake!  What about him?
What's Liddy got?
Sir?
I'll talk to Helms.  Oh, Pat asked if you're coming to the Residence for dinner tonight.
Yes, sir.  I'll talk to Helms, and, uh ... what's our press position on this Watergate thing?  What do I tell Ziegler to tell them?
You never told him?
Wait till the Mai-tais wear off.
What about the documents he promised?
Thou must.
Yes ... It involves some old and forgotten papers.  Things I signed as Vice President.  I want the originals in my office and I don't want copies anywhere else.
Would you walk with me down to the paddock?  I'd like to look at the horses for the eighth.
You asked if you could count on my support ... As long as I can count on yours.
We'll see about that.
Here, Tim ... Tim.  I'm as frustrated as you, Henry, but don't you think this one's a Democrat problem.  They started the war; it makes them look bad.
Jews and Negros don't win elections, Henry.  Better to hang them around the Democrats' necks.
Yes, Mr. President.
That was Mr. Kennedy.
You know, this kinda thing, you gotta be brutal.  A leak happens, the whole damn place should be fired.  Really. You do it like the Germans in World War II.  If they went through these towns and a sniper hit one of them, they'd line the whole goddamned town up and say: "Until you talk you're all getting shot."  I really think that's what has to be done.  I don't think you can be Mr. Nice-guy anymore ...
You all know me.  I'm one of you, I grew up a stone's throw from here on a little lemon ranch in Yorba Linda ...
Uh, is your mother ... still alive?
She must be very attractive.  Would she like an autograph?  She might remember me ... Where's Trini?
Who the fuck are they?  Bob, are you working on revoking the Posts's television license?  Good.
No.  I'm not going to listen to any more speeches ever again.
It's over, Dick.
Not that.  Us.
Then I'll be there for you.
Can I just ask for one thing?
Will you ... would you kiss me?
Brezhnev's coming in three days.  I don't want to deal with them.  And him.  And you.
No, but I liked your book on nuclear weapons.  We have similar views on the balance of power ...
Couple hundred on his person. Those hombres would've taken the stash.
It's all the goddamned money, Ed Tom. The money and the drugs.  It's just goddamned beyond everything. What is it mean? What is it leading to?
If you'd a told me twenty years ago I'd see children walkin' the streets of our Texas towns with green hair and bones in their noses I just flat out wouldn't of believed you.
It's the tide. It's the dismal tide. It is not the one thing.
It could be.
The old boy shot by the highway?
That's very linear Sheriff.
Believe you're right.
Yes Sheriff.
You want me to wait til you've quit the building?
No. But I gave my word.
To your husband.
Your husband had the opportunity to remove you from harm's way. Instead, he used you to try to save himself.
I don't say anything. Except it was foreseen.
Try standin' in the door and hollerin: Mama I'm home.
C'mon, pack your things. Anything you leave you ain't gonna see again.
Did you not hear me? We can't give out no information.
You know who it is.
With what?
Is that what you're asking me? Is there something wrong with anything?
Sir?
...Where you want me to put it?
If your expenses run higher I hope you'll trust us for it.
How well do you know Chigurh.
That's not an answer.
I'd just like to know your opinion of him. In general. Just how dangerous is he?
I know, I've seen him. Sort of.
I was saying that it seems probable that she witnessed the murder, but her memory of it is gone, at least for the time being. I also think you ought to have her stay with someone tonight.  Any idea who Chloe or Lonnie are?
Well, you should find out. She keeps talking about them...
Yeah?
...and half the other guys in this town. Including you, I believe...
Anyway, so what?
You said a woman couldn't have done it.
So you're saying Betty Sizemore -- our Betty Sizemore -- who you were in swing choir with -- has now hired somebody to scalp her husband in her own kitchen while she watched? You're amazing.
That's a nice name for what you need...
...I... I know what you are.
I've got a pretty good idea. You're here to kill me, so kill me. You want me to be afraid, but I'm not. I don't care who you are, or why you two killed my husband...
I wouldn't have put it quite that way, but...
I don't think I am.
Do what?
Betty! Listen to me! Del is ...
What happened when you were twelve?
Wow... You just gave me goosebumps, you know that? You make it all sound so real. Great improv...
I know. Listen, we need to take a time out here. Can we talk seriously for a minute?
At last! I know how much you want this. You're gifted and extremely determined, but... it's not up to me.
My treat. You were saying... something about how stupid you've been?
Kinda like you'd been saying it since you got on the plane...
Mmm-hmm. Listen, I forgive you, Mr. McCord...
...George. I do.  My best friend once said if you were any handsomer it would be a crime...
...it's too bad you're such an asshole. 'S the only thing that Del was ever right about.
Thanks, Roy, you're sweet... a big liar, but sweet. I liked your editorial this morning...
That's horrible!
Man, that is love.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Shhh! I heard you the first time.
If you didn't want to do it, you should have said so! Is this about gas money?
No, please. Go ahead, it's your funeral...
Well, what if this guy's just playing with you? What if he's lying about who he is?
Does he ever talk about medicine? His patients, the hospital?
Georgia. In case I didn't tell you, it's cash only, gentlemen.
Hmmmm. "Five Stars," huh?  Is that stupid, Wesley?
IT SURE IS!!
We don't. But a '97 Le Sabre'll be easy to find if it's here, town this size...  He said he gave his wife some car as a gift, remember?
I know that.
Maybe she had to use the bathroom. She pees, doesn't she?!...
Oh, five years, give or take.
Aren't you a sweetheart... no, not quite. Anyway, she's been with us awhile.
No... she just wanted something outta life. Anything. And with Del, she wasn't getting nothing. That's her husband, Del. I'm sorry about what happened and all, but that's the way I feel about all of this...
If it helps bring her back, be my guest...
...who doesn't?
What the hell's going on?
Look Joyce, I need your key to the files, not advice, okay? This is a complex case.
I don't think she will. She's a slut, but I just don't think she's that mean. Jasmine'll bring her around...
You mis'able little sneak thief...
Gopher, Everett?
Caintcha see it Everett! Them sigh- reens did this to Pete! They loved him up an' turned him into a horney- toad!
Everett, my beard itches.
Well now Pappy I wouldn't put it that strong...
I ain't worn it since our divorce came through. It must still be in the rolltop in the old cabin. Never thought I'd need it; Vernon bought one encrusted with jewels.
We ain't gettin' married with his ring!  You said you'd changed!
Ain't gonna be no weddin'.
No weddin'.
Sell that. I figured it could only have painful associations for Wash.
Isn't it, uh...
Wait a minute - who elected you leader a this outfit? Since we been followin' your lead we got nothin' but trouble! I gotten this close to bein' strung up, n'consumed in a fire, 'n whipped no end, 'n sunstroked, 'n soggied -
Well people like that reform. Maybe we should get us some.
Great.
I ain't never going back to that school, sir.
I don't care about that. I just ain't going back. You don't want me? Okay. I'll find me another place.
I wrote. Not every week...
I never said any of that!
Okay, I wrote those things... and yeah, I had big thoughts of getting together with your mom... but when she hit me with being pregnant, I saw who she was. I'd had quiff lay that shit on me before!
No, sir!
Stop eyeballing me, Mayo, or you're out!
Yes, sir!
Yes, sir!!
Don't worry. I'll respect you afterwards.
Lynette, watch your mouth! Somebody might overhear.
Yeah, I saw 'em. Poor guys.
Don't worry. It grows out about an inch by them.
Lynette, just keep your mouth shut until we get to the motel. Will you do that for me, please.
Where's that coming from? I wouldn't fuck now if my life depended on it!
That's no excuse for not going after what you want.
Twenty-two years ago.
Yeah. All week long.
Sure.
I can't let her go off and have the kid by herself and not do anything. If it's my kid, too, then I've got a responsibility, don't I?
But it would still be my kid. That's the point.
It's mine.
God.
Who else but God could think this shit up?  I spend ten years building those fucking rooms to keep people out, now I gotta figure out how to get in.  God, man, He just loves the irony.
I don't know, she keeps screamin' the same thing over and over.
We've got the Kid!  WE'VE GOT YOUR KID!!  What the fuck is she thinking?!
Yeah.  Kidnapping.
Pure idiot.
Lookin' doubtful there, Big Guy, but ten out of ten for attitude.
He's talking about Bernard Pearlstine.
Don't!
Open the door.
Say fuck.
"Get the fuck out of my house."
Yeah, but where's the third guy?
What do you mean? We're black ain't we? And we care about improving the plight of out people don't we? Or you figure oppression stops at that thing dangling between your legs!
But nothing, we want full fledged membership in the Black Panther Party... and none of this "Okay sugah as long as you stay in the background washing my socks and rubbing my feet" bullshit either!
Well as the Rev says, God helps those who help themselves.  We'll be our own stoplight.
Just hold on a god damn minute. I...
Mothafuck... Hey!!! What the hell!!!
Yeah, it was alright. Hey, can you give me a lift?
No, Panther Headquarters.  Least that way we could hang out more like we used to.
Neither your stomach or your opinion matters here Dorsett... What matters is that Mr. Trafficante and the Bureau have come up with a solution to our Panther Problem. One might say...The Final Solution.
Yeah... but it seems they're bringing Malcolm's widow Betty Shabazz to town, to speak at a rally, do an interview for Ramparts.  And they want us to help with security.
Yeah.
You got that right. And brother, I got a feeling it's going to get a whole lot thicker.
He had a feeling you'd be coming by.
All of the above, man...  And then some.
It's alright.  I'm very happy for you.
Pride will do.
You couldn't have known.
Thomas is dead but you've done nothing for which you should be ashamed.
Please accept my apology for not having done so sooner.
That one is a bit more difficult.
And what are inappropriate levels of hostile attention?
Restrain them from the targeting of civilians, including women and children?
I consider them linked.
As long as your soldiers attack civilians, I will order the shooting of your officers at the outset of every engagement.  And my men are excellent marksmen.
The middle colonies?
Anything about the convention in Philadelphia?
Yes, sir.
She said that?  Oh, my Lord, she said that?
He left us.
Gabriel.
No, thank the Lord.  He's more like his mother.
Thank you.
We could go stay at Aunt Charlotte's farm.  She's to the west.
No, he won't.  There are two things you need to know about Cornwallis. First, he is a very proud man, He would rather risk defeat than share a victory.  If you give him what he thinks is an out, he'll take it.
Bite?
Who is this Paxcow? Is he like the boogeyman?
Lovey...Church might be still alive when you're in a high school...and that's a very long time.
I won't...is Missy in heaven, do you think?
Sure, carnation. Like in that movie you rented, Audrey Rose.
Do you believe that?
Jud, do you remember the name of the student that died on Louis's first day at work? The one that was hit by a car?
Ayuh--they get older as you go toward the middle.  Pete LaVasseur's dog is buried there...  the Stoppard boys' racing pigeon that Missus Cowley's cat got...and I think that's the cat himself right there, although it's been so many years I can't tell for sure.  Missy Ellen! Come over here just a minute!
Nothing.  Do we plant him on the outer circle or start a new one?
Don't worry about that.
Because it's right.
This babe has said enough.
Timmy Baterman. That was wrong.
According to what Mr. Crandall says, the road's a lot more dangerous than the operation. Church will be just the same. Well--almost the same--and we won't have to worry about him getting turned into catburgers by one of those damn Orinco trucks.
AnaMaria!  Have you seen Gibbs?  I need to put together --
Simple.  I have something you won't more than anything.  The way to free you from the curse of the treasure.  You have something I want -- more than anything.
You give me the Pearl.  Then I tell you who you need.
Because, right about now, the H.M.S. Dauntless is lying in wait in the harbor.
Turner blood doesn't flow pure in his veins.  Best play it safe, and spill it all.
It's a pirate medallion.
Your father is frantic with worry. Our mission was to rescue you and return home.  That is what we shall do.  Mr. Turner's fate is regrettable.  But so was his decision to engage in piracy.
About the day we met. Do you remember?
Me!
No, I'm -- rescuing you.
You'll be positively the most fearsome pirates to sail the Spanish Main.
That he is.
The wind is quarter from astern ... by the time we're underway, we'll never catch them.
I said, no lies.
I do.  And I practice with them. At least three hours a day.
Remarkable how often those two traits coincide.
Depends.
On whether the stories are all true.  If they are, that's a waterfall that spills over at high tide, with a short drop to an underground lagoon.  If not --
And no lies!
Speak.
Do you know what I see?  I see man making his own clouds.  I see man coloring his own sky, and like this garden it is a site that makes my heart sing.
Oh no.  You're not like me.  In fact, I'm betting you're the same greedy, remorseless, egomaniacal bad guy you always were.
You're right.  Place a call to our friends at the network and to Mr. Joplin at the E.P.A.
Considering what?
In the meantime, why don't you find something useful for Dr. Bright to do.
Yeah.  But it wasn't a group.  It was one man.
Smell?  Uh, something like methylcyanoacrylate.
Yes.  That's it.  He's got it.  Oh God, he's got it!
That's what I thought.
Once the subject was polymerized we were unable to reassemble the original organic structure.
That's right.
I'm glad you came to me for help.
On the counter.
We don't have time to argue, Susan.
It's a miracle.
Yes, that is what I was thinking.
Yes, he might be.
No? Why not?
So, it's obvious, huh?
I'm afraid she's right, Mrs. Schuyler. I'm really very sorry, Mrs. Schuyler, that you feel this way. I was in hopes that you would like me. I'm not the burglar that you think I am. After all, we're married. I think the thing to do is to kiss and make up - Mother.
Oh, you can't carry a tune - you can't carry a tune - all you are good for is to sit and spoon, spoon. Oh no, I won't wear garters
Look out for my lipstick, Stewart.
Are you crazy?
Will you stop being silly, Stewart?
But I don't want to meet your gang.
Meaning, my friends aren't worthwhile, I suppose?
That's exactly what you mean. Heaven knows you've made that clear to me often enough. Well, I'm sick and tired of it. I've given you party after party - I've taken you to some of the best houses in this town - and introduced you to people of importance - and are you grateful? No! You insult them and act like a bore. I'm sick and tired of having to make excuses for you and the things that you've done. Perhaps it's just as well you're not coming tonight. Maybe I can enjoy myself for once without having to worry about you, and what you're going to do.
I was so worried for fear he'd knock over a vase or something. I must have acted like an idiot.  What does it say about the reception last night?
Stop it. Anne. You're behaving like the person you're married to.
It was a miracle. The man was ill or something.
But right now I'm acting in the capacity of Mrs. Schuyler's attorney.
I know, I know. But there's no truth in the story whatsoever.
Sure, sure. That's all right. That was a great story, Bingy. A great story - wish I'd printed it.
You've raised it up to the chin, I see.  Go on in the other room and get yourself a drink.
A what?
Aw, you've been reading a lot of cheap tabloids. Anne and myself are going to move downtown in a nice little flat, we're gonna forget all about this social stuff, and we're gonna be known as Mr. and Mrs. Stew Smith. How do you like that?
Yeah, live on my salary - that is, until I finish writing my play.
My play.
Siberian bloodhound?  No. That's been all rewritten. It's laid in Araby now.
Sure.
There you are. You caught on. You see, you're nice and you're smart too. You caught on right away. Outside! Go on! Outside! And don't come back!
On now, Stew, don't be too hard on her. I wouldn't call her a brewery horse.
And the rest of us are truck horses?
Well!
Nothing.
I dyed one and washed the other.
Conrad.
I don't know a thing about him, but isn't he the one you're always yelling about?
I have it here.
Come right in - I'll get you a drink.
Sure.
It's all right. Bring him in.
Why
Now the lady said you may go
Thanks.
No, I ... I was just ... worried about her.
Hello Bill.
But I really should get home.
Where are you gonna go?
What are you doing?
So.
"Changes."
No. What?
One of those ... big beds?
Well--it was dark out ...
It was accessible to everyone.
I thought the books were blank?
I don't know.
Just watch. You know why those guys just get cats out of trees? 'Cause nothing burns around here, that's why! They don't need any firemen ...
Sure.
Oh. Thanks, Margaret.
Oh, no ... You baked those for Whitey.
No. You baked them for Whitey.
They just grow like that?
Marathon starts at 6:30. Contest's tomorrow at noon.
Of course it is Howard. That's why they call it a Marathon.
Weil wouldn't you! You look for someone for years ... You pour your heart into it ... This is a privilege you know.  I don't think I better talk about this right now.
I don't think we should discuss this until I'm a little bit more composed.
Maybe in a day or so when I'm not so emotional ...
Why?
Why don't you just take me back without it?
... Yeah.
Yes.
Oh my Gosh, Bud ...
What happened?
Ok. Thank you.
OH MY GOD. Look at that.
We got disconnected before....
See the thing is I could make it really easy on you -- I already have your credit card number, your information, address and stuff. This is so awkward asking like this, I'm sorry --
I need help.
I don't have a girlfriend --
I know I did. But I don't.
I didn't lie.
This is....illegal....I'll call the police.
That's not mine it's one of the guys that works here. That pudding's not mine.
Yes.
Nothing.
Nothing.
What's that? What is that that you're doing?
I know what you mean, I know what you mean, I get this feeling --
IIIIIIIIIII don't want to hurt anything ever, but what I'm talking about is -- have you ever held a little puppy or a little kitten and it's just the cutest, softest, most precious thing in the world and out of the blue you get this feeling in your gut and all you wanna do is squeeze it. Just fuckin squeeze the shit out of it. To take a little puppy and smash its skull...just so precious, so beautiful. Just so god damn wonderful and cute you wanna smack it and kick it and love it. Fuck. I don't know. I don't know. And you, you.....I'm looking at you and I just....your face is so beautiful I just wanna smash it, just smash it with a sledgehammer and squeeze it...you're so pretty.
That's fine.
Hi Walter.
Business is very food, thanks. ELIZABETH What's very food?
Hi, Lance.
Wait a minute --
Please don't do this.
Ok.
Can we maybe ask for more money on this?
Ok.
At your service, Count.
He's not the man who's cast a shadow here.
It's not even noon --
That monstrous God of yours? He strung up his very own son like a side of veal; I shudder to think what He'd do to me.
Your wig. Remove your wig.
Playing dress-up with cretins? That sounds like a symptom of madness; not its cure.
Oh indeed?
Gibberish, my friend. He rants and he raves --
Was ever a man more risqu? He wants to take me every way!
Is it awfully violent?
Is it terribly erotic?
How do you propose I write it? With dust, upon the air?
Now is the time to secure your epitaph. The benevolent Marquise, Charenton's most revered philanthropist... or Satan's Bride.
It's the way of all martyrs, isn't it?
Mr. Welles certainly is a caution
And attractive in a hammy sort of way.
You know that can't happen.
Why is that, Louis?
Nailed us, hub? The crazy old man and his whore.
Bought and p-p-paid for. Just like one of his goddamn statues. Well at least in the movie he married her!
I am not that woman.
"You talk about the people as if you owned them. As though they belonged to you. As long as I can remember, you've talked about--"  Orson, I am so goddamn tired--
All right! Enough! I've heard this from Schaefer and RKO. I've heard it from everyone--
Nonsense
Orson, please ... it's too bright
This girl on a dock. White dress. Never said a word to her.
She was . . . innocent
Mank, sit down. You missed the opening of the new picture but I'll go back--
Yeah, ain't it swell?
Again
That soulless monster gets no tears from me.
Yes!
I'm Christ
Yes! Vibrant and modern and stark like a Picasso sketch drawn to flashes of lightning I We shoot the whole thing in the gallant American West--
You were great, Jake. Just like old times. Good thing Sugar Ray wasn't here tonight. Oh Jake, this is State's Attorney Bronson and his wife.
'Cause I wanna catch her alone.
She ever go with them? Like Salvy?
What does that have to do with it? She don't look 15 to me. I heard somethin' with Salvy. She was with him once or somethin', I think. It was like some blonde. That's the one...
Yeah, she's nice.
You wasn't with her, were you?
You wasn't with her?
You know, like bang her or anything?
Nah, not now -- all those hard-ons around. I'll wait. Not now.
I remember the first time I met Vickie... I know there's somethin' up. I know she's doin' somethin', but I can't catch her...
What do you mean?
When I'm away, did you ever notice anythin' funny with her? Tell me the truth.
I want you to keep an eye on her when I'm not here. Understand?
What did Tommy say?
Yeah, I know.
Stop it. What're you, crazy?
I ain't ever talked to a movie star before.
Oh no? I thought you was a movie star.
Now take your panties off.
Do I have to kill you, eh?  Do I have to kill somebody to get an answer?  I know about you at the Copa. I know all about it.
No. I won't talk to you where you can use your hands on me.
I got a lawyer, Jake. We're getting a divorce. I'm getting custody of the kids.
I'm sick of it. I can't watch you this way. You're too drunk all the time. There's too many girls. I can't... I don't wanna talk about it. I made up my mind.
Look, I'm just tellin' you how Tommy feels. Jake is makin' it hard on himself. Tommy wants him with us. It's as simple as that.
When the lock is broken -- yes.
Who left -- where?
That depends on who "they" were.
Who are you?
Why should I?
I don't know what you mean.
I only have a hundred dollars or so.
Probably. But when I do, it'll be to someone who thinks of life as more than a new dress, a lobster dinner, and the latest scandal. I need a woman who'll go anywhere, do anything, and love it.
Get back there! He'll see you!
What?
You can tell that from here?
Would four of them -- ?
Then I wouldn't worry too much. But let's keep an eye on her.
Mrs. Doyle?
Jeff again.  Has Tom come in yet?
You haven't even heard from him?
Yeah -- I want to get this thing off and get moving.
You can't fit in here -- I can't fit in there. According to you, people should be born, live an die on the same --
Something too frightful to utter.
Thinking about Thorwald?
Not a word. He was going to check on the railroad station, and the trunk. He must be still on it.
It's utterly beautiful.  I wish I could be creative.
I do?
It's just a picture of the backyard, that's all.
A new disease.
I'm glad they let you out.
I heard about it.  You're lucky he lived.
Know the Millertown bluff?
You make any sandwiches?
Well--
I think I know my son.
No, honey.  No, he's not here.
What's the charge?
I hitched.
My personality's showing again. Should I leave?
I had to go to a head-shrinker.  I only went twice though.  My mother said it cost too much, so she went to Hawaii instead.
What do you think?
I have to talk to someone, Mom.  I have to talk to you both.  And Dad this time you got to give me an answer.
No.
Leave me alone.
I don't know why--!
I just get so--  Boy, sometimes the temperature goes way up. RAY  Okay.  Okay.  Let it out.
Bully for you.
Now that's true!
"Life is crushing in on me."
Where what was.
Who lives?
Won't mother be proud.
I feel as if I'm walking under water.
We have to go back!
I don't think.  I know.  He looks at me like I'm the ugliest thing in the world.  He doesn't like my friends--he--
Gabriel -- !
Gabriel, what are you doing!
To all those cons...
We musta written what, twenty of 'em? And they were before this guy. One, two letters apiece, ten to the racetrack guy in Leavenworth --
-- plus the forty to Mason... how many letters is that?
What.
Blackjack, Nick, blackjack I am good at. I mean, they'd give us some free games or something, wouldn't they? Since you worked there?
And the slots, slots I'm good at too. Wouldn't that be fun?
We could live it up and --
You're not hearing me here --
He didn't "find" Nick's letters, did he.
You told him about Nick's letters.
You're in on this.
Here and there. Restaurant, uh, that's the main expansion. Tables've been moved around; the big man's office, I dunno, might be upstairs now.
I'm almost done.
If he wanted a photographic memory, he shoulda kidnapped one. I'm working on it here.
Oh, I know you, Nick. I know you real well.
The hell I can't.
I don't know.
Five million?
Christmas... Eve...
Put it on.
No, Gabriel... no...
Hey! HEY! THERE IS A POWWOW SAFE!
What... Powwow...
I don't steal any --
And Monster... he was talking with the casino manager. Nick was talking to him.
How do we take them out?
How do we do that?
I'm just saying.
I'm just talking.
Alamo...
I'M NOT NICK!
You don't hafta lift shit. You don't really work there. But as far as the records are concerned, you do. I call up Matthews, the foreman, tell him he's got a new guy. You're on the schedule. You got a timecard, it's clocked in and out for you everyday, and you get a pay check at the end of the week. And ya know dock workers don't do too bad. So you can move into a halfway decent place without Scagnetti thinkin "what the fuck." And if Scagnetti ever wants to make a surprise visit, you're gone that day. That day we sent you to Tustin. We gotta bunch of shit you needed to unload there. You're at the Taft airstrip pickin' up a bunch of shit and bringing it back. Part of your job is goin' different places - and we got places all over the place.
This isn't all that bad. We can give you a lot of legitimate jobs. Put you on the rotation at Long Beach as a dock worker.
Let me say this out loud, just to get it straight in my mind. According to you, Mr. Blonde was gonna kill you. Then when we came back, kill us, grab the diamonds, and scram. That's your story? I'm correct about that, right?
You two take the manager in the back and make him give you the diamonds. We're there for those stones, period. Since no display cases are being fucked with, no alarms should go off. We're out of there in two minutes, not one second longer. What if the manager won't give up the diamonds?
Fuck you, wrong. I'm right! What the fuck do you know about it anyway? You're still listening to Jerry- fucking-Vale.
Sorry, it's my book now.
You do?
Freddy Newendyke.
Shit. I don't remember that at all.
All this blood is scaring the shit outta me. I'm gonna die, I know it.
No, I'm not!
Look, I ordered coffee. Now we've been here a long fuckin' time, and she's only filled my cup three times. When I order coffee, I want it filled six times.
He ain't dead.
I think he's just passed out.
What are you gonna do about him?
But I'm going to have to leave 'em here. They're --- well they're not the sort of people you're used to.
And one of 'em is sick.
I'm Clay Phillips.  My brother Steve.
Can we get a doctor at that ranch?
Not on this trail, I don't. I've been over it before. Anyway, you ought to be pretty sleepy. Why don't you climb in back.
There won't be any rest of the trip. Over the hill is a stage road and when we hit it you get dumped into the first stage that comes along. So keep your money. You'll need it for the fare. I'm fed up with you. I was fed up with you before we started.
Why?
I haven't got the job yet.
Like what?
How'd you happen to miss?
Good thing you didn't.
Sit down and eat. Till I say the word, you're doing what you're told.
You keep your nose out of my life, young fella.
All right, you didn't know.
Nobody asked you to.
Me snoopin'? I came down here to take a bath.
They went on like I told you.
Until Pa gets around to driving us to Minden.
No we don't. But that's where we're going. From Minden we take a stage to Reno, then another one over to Auburn and another one to Placerville. Then it's a day's trip to Sonora.
He certainly could. About a month.
Stop it --
I can't read, Ma'am. I just look at the pictures.
There's plenty of use for reading -- you'll see.
Thanks, Steve.
Never happened!
Yes, I feel their spirits. Cora... Keaton... I am here to communicate...
Yes, of course, Uriah. I feel his evil presence.
But he could still be haunting the house. He's angry that he had to leave.
Open chest!!!
Great!!!
Huh?
Oh, Buddy, I've never had someone be so protective of me!
This is Ray. What's up? Where are you?
What's your location? I repeat, what's your location?
Made you say it!
Father, I don't understand. Tell me what happened?
Yes, it was reported, but never substantiated.
Why don't you shut up, Professor? Just relax.
Yes, I thought that it would be best.
Hi.
What do you know about it?!... Listen, the ghost is too powerful. The only chance we have is to use this machine.  I need you to go get the others and meet us upstairs.
What?
I'm totally freakin' dude. I keep having these nightmares, then I wake up screaming with these awful back spasms. I can't take it anymore, man.
Alright, but I ain't drinking. and you're gonna have to look after me.
Carl can't believe how much I make at swap meets.
Aw, Mom! I hate Mr. Stubbins!
Oh Mom...
Dr. Sutphin is your wife a big reader?
Officers, I've never said the P-word out loud, much less written it down!
Look officers! Life doesn't have to be ugly.  See the little birdie? Listen to his call.  Peter Pan! Peter Pan! Peter Pan!
It's a shame. But they should brush their teeth, honey.
I beg your pardon?
Mrs. Wilson from the telephone company. I understand you're having problems with obscene calls.
Let the record show I'm just standing here.
No, honey, it's the police.  Hello, officers.
Yes, but I lent it...
Yes... but... I didn't...
No...  I don't have room in my kitchen...
We have mice! I mean it, Ralph! I saw one!
Yes, I understand.
No.
How much have you got?
For the time being, I imagine that must do.
Yes.
Oh, I'm making investigations.
Look, Mary, now that I know you better, I think I can be more frank with you. I don't believe you. I still can't understand the reason for such a wild tale. It's like some of Jacqueline's stories.
There is a very simple way. Got a telephone book?
I don't think that's a good subject for jokes, Mr. Hoag.
Don't be ridiculous. For months I've had the best private detective in New York looking for Miss Gibson.
You don't even know Jacqueline Gibson.
It may make very fine poetry, Mr. Hoag, but it doesn't make good sense.
Why wait?
And then?
You will die.
But it's a small room, Jason.
Bella Romari If I were not seated, I would embrace you in three movements like a sonata.  Ah, my wonderful one. Fly with me tonight. We will take your coffee machine and live with the gypsies.
Uhhuh.
Actually I want to ask two favors of you -- one as a poet  one as a detective.
They may have found her.  Mrs. Cortez - this morning I told her Jacqueline was no longer under my care.
No. She's no longer under my care.
I can't give up looking for her, Mrs. Redi, no matter what you're hinting at.
I don't believe it.
Sh-h-h Nancy. The other children.
It won't hurt.
Thank you.
Kids? What about them?
Yeah, actually, I do. But John doesn't. At least not right now.
I don't know, he just said he wants to wait. I quit asking.
The... interviews are about sex, Ann.
Yes.
Everything about sex.
Like what they've done, what they do, what they don't do, what they want to do but are afraid to ask for, what they won't do even if asked. Anything I can think of.
Yes.
Mostly. Sometimes they do things.
No, not to me, for me, for the camera.
I'm sorry this came up.
Maybe you want to go.
Absolutely not.
I'm not in love with you.
I... I can't answer that precisely.
That's very flattering.
Ann. Are you asking me hypothetically, or are you asking me for real, right now?
Are you going to see Elizabeth while you're here?
No, but I wanted to. I really wanted to, partially just to piss you off.
About a week ago. I don't know what brought it on, I just started feeling like I didn't want him to touch me.
Oh, yeah.  But see, I've never really been into sex that much, I mean, I like it and everything, it just does't freak me out, I wouldn't miss it, you know? But anyway, lately we haven't been doing anything at all. Like I said, it's not that I miss it, but I'm curious the way things kind of slacked off all of a sudden.
Do you have to say that?
You know what. You say it just to irritate me.
Well, he doesn't strike me as the kind of person that would go in for that sort of thing, anyway.
Well, I wonder why.
Oh, for God's sake. Really, Cynthia, really, I don't think he's your type.
I have a pretty good idea.
He doesn't have a phone.
But he won't.
He's not getting a phone, he doesn't like talking on the phone.
Let me talk to him first.
I don't feel right just giving you the address so that you can go over there and...
And... do whatever it is you do.
Well. I can't stay.
Cynthia Patrice Bishop.
My first sexual experience or the first time I had intercourse?
I was... eight years old. Michael Green, who was also eight, asked if he could watch me take a pee. I said he could if I could watch him take one, too. He said okay, and then we went into the woods behind our house. I got this feeling he was chickening out because he kept saying, "Ladies first!" So I pulled down my underpants and urinated, and he ran away before I even finished.
No. He kind of avoided me for the rest of the summer, and then his family moved away. To Cleveland, actually.
When I was fourteen.
Very much live.
Not really. I didn't picture it with veins or ridges or anything, I thought it would be smooth, like a test tube.
No. If anything, after I looked at it awhile, it got more interesting. It had character, you know?
It was warmer than I thought it would be, and the skin was softer than it looked. It's weird. Thinking about it now, the organ itself seemed like a separate thing, a separate entity to me. I mean, after he pulled it out and I could look at it and touch it, I completely forgot that there was a guy attached to it. I remember literally being startled when the guy spoke to me.
He said that my hand felt good.
Then I started moving my hand, and then he stopped talking.
Could be risky.
No, I mean doing it at my house.
Maybe.
Cynthia, I don't think you want to, I mean, you should see the way he dresses. I really think he's in a bad way.
You're intrigued?
Did he put you up to this?
Graham.
I can't believe I let him stay in my house. Right under my nose. That deviant fucker was right under my nose and I didn't see him.
God, you... you're mean.
Maybe I don't want to leave. Maybe I want to talk.
I knew it, I knew it. Things are getting complicated.
I'm not going to give you my keys.
Let's get outta here before somebody hears us!
No. I don't think so.
OK. But late.
I hit it. I hit it with my cane. Then I carry it on the cane and I throw it down to the incinerator, down to the garbage.
Rollo, you know me. Once a GP, always a GP.
You oughta be careful yourself. Might end up cutting your throat.
Who was she?
Good!  I'm gonna be there.
Looks like 'Rest Home' for this marriage.
They probably meant Irving and wanted you to swing.
It's happened before.  Remember Lieutenant Orpheus?  He disappeared into that Underworld series and never came back.
Ah yes.  Farley Flavors.  You know, I find it...
Not at all.  You have your life.  And I have mine.
TENDERNESS AND INNOCENCE IN DENTON`
He's a lame dog, remember?  But even he wouldn't want to see you like this.
No...couldn't I do this later?
We understand you've been going through a rather trying time.
CRIMINAL
I'm a bad girl. I'm a bad girl.
Yeah, I'm here.
So I guess that's it.
Oh, yeah. Real well. Still do.
Hi. Well, nice to see you guys here. Bye, Miles.
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
I liked it a lot. A lot of improvements. It just seemed overall, I don't know, tighter, more... congealed or something.
Oh yeah. Much better.
Well, then I guess it must have felt new because everything leading up to it was so different.
I told you. Filet and salmon.
I don't know. Salmon. Don't you always have white wine with fish?
Let me call Christine.
I owe her a call anyway.
Just a minute!
So what's the plan today?
I don't know. Casual but nice. They think you're a writer.
She's been leaving messages here too.
Yeah.
I don't want to talk about it.
Yeah, it's Frass Canyon. It's a joke.
I don't have to.
What?
Jesus, Jack. Jesus. And you walked all the way back from Solvang?
That's five clicks, Jackson.
You said it looked like a car accident.
I'll pay for it.
See you.
Yeah, Siena's a sweetie.
She's with her grandmother. She's with Steph's mom. She spends a lot of time over there. Steph's... well, she's Stephanie.
What rehearsal dinner?
Miles, don't call me when you're drunk.
Ken.
Miles, I don't care if you come to the wedding or not.
I'm going to hang up now, Miles.
Exactement!
And I could have already put clean sheets on the other bed and the fold- out. You are staying. Wendy, Ron and the twins are picking us up at 11:30 to go to brunch at the Sheraton. They do a magnificent job there. Wendy is so excited you're coming.
No dad!
You love walks.
Yes it was.
What's furry, furry rabbit?
What time is it?
I'm sorry I hurt your arm.
Me too.
Who wrote this book?
You're scaring your sister.
No.
Don't worry.
Honest to God, Emmett, he would've killed me.
Sure.
They've been kind to me.
I guess I put a good scare into him.
In my town, when you're looking for someone, you ask me.
Which way do you mean?
I've got a job.
I can't say I'm convinced you're going anywhere.
I've got no reason to run. It was a fair fight and there were plenty of witnesses.
The other guy drew first.
I wanted a drink and a bed. I guess I came to the wrong place.
Is there a place in town that takes... my kind?
That ain't right.
Good luck, Mal.
I just got to town.
I run the place. What can I get you?
What do you mean?
It wasn't her body.  It was her body of work.
I am telling the truth.
No!!  I can prove it to you.  I'll take you to her.
You can have everything -- office, car, assistants -- all I want is the picture.
So there's no problem -- I can have the rights, the negative too?
I don't need a star.  All I need is an actor -- I'll reshoot the part, cut out Nicola and replace her with a real actor.  A real leading lady.
Better late than never.
You really think so?
Thank you.  I'll tell Simone you liked it.
Soon.  Soon.
Everyone you know is lying.
Lainey and I just wanted to congratulate...
No... it's life.
Of course.
... so much like her?
I do find myself physically attracted to you, Mr. Taransky.
Hello, Hal.
You never were together, Hal.
Clyde.
Really?  She didn't mention it.
That's the point, Hank.  No matter how good they are, they're still Mickey Mouse.  Everyone's tried. Everyone's failed.  It can't be done.
I don't know anything about computers.
What's that?
You do?
You saw that?
Listen, Hank, it's been a rough day.  I'll call you about his next week.
I'm already dead.
If anyone asks about Simone --
Exactly.  Don't you wonder where I'm really hiding Simone?
Me and Simone.  What I did.
Er,... good.
What do you want -- ?
-- Cashier's check went out to our anonymous tipster this morning -- worth every penny too.  Who says there's no place for checkbook journalism?  We'll be running stills of this for months, then release the whole tape -- we'll get our money back -- maybe show it on an exclusive pay-per-view event. Do you realize what we have here? We have the only independent footage of Simone in existence.
Perfect.  God, I'm so relaxed around you.
Not, "Eternity Forever"?  The legendary unproduced script that was too good ever to get made?  I'd kill for that part.
I trust you... Besides, I don't know if I'm up for the Amish today. You can't curse or spit or anything around them.
Next time I won't be scared of you.
What about Mrs. Marschal?
No, walking around, like regular people... They can't see each other. Some of them don't know they're dead.
It means I wasn't what everyone thought I was...  I was a fake.
Someone else can help you. Someone else can make you happy.
I definitely won't.
Yeah.
They did?
Oh my God.
They used to hang people here.
It's our pleasure.
Chuck E. who?
Nikes? What-the-hail you talkin' about?
The hell with this.  I'm coming back up!!!
Well, why don't you hold these as evidence in the meantime.
Cowshit? Are you sure the Aztecs even had cows?
The Sheriff?! We don't need the sheriff!!! We need to get the hell out of here!
That's a good idea. Maybe we should have a little "talk" about grandaddy Jethro.
People say he was a murderer.
Yeah. Our own. I don't see why we got to go along for the ride.
Tell me you checked the bus before we left, Carl.
I... heard something... came in here last night. Must have gone to sleep.
You've been... hiding him all these years. Helping him... irrigate the land. With blood...
CARL??? Carl did this?!!
Just checking out the lights.
I know what people say, Bill. I... Remember, back in high school I worked at my father's gas station?
Think we should get up a search party, head in there?
Your momma wasn't too proud when you came out neither, Wally.
Took the kids to his Mom's for the weekend.
Wearing white, just like on our... wedding day. I remember it.
And you said the worms are part of him. They're all linked, like one creature?
An animal that doesn't procreate. It spreads, grows. A living disease.
America's bored.  Now, what do you want?
Whaddya want to know? My sign?
Having fun.
Driving?
They're both a challenge.
Yeah, I do. Especially from that angle.
I don't know. We were planning on seeing the Astrodome.
Yeah, it's tough when your cheek- bones are your main asset.
Bandit II?
See ya, Kate.
Yeah, I can tell he's gonna be a major asset.
Can a pig whistle?
Yeah, guy?
It's gonna be close. Real close.
Bandit, this is Mister B, and I'm gearjamming this rolling refinery. You got another Smokey on the rubber?
That's a Texas bubble gum machine on your back porch.
And everybody, all the time. Yeah, it's a chore.
Heller was buried in agency lore, anytime an operative failed or was perceived to have failed, Hoover blackballed their memory. Look at Ness.
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, he had the badge and everything. It said "FBI" on it.
Yeah.
I sent Hugo, he should be there!
Look at that, we didn't have to fill up the whole blackboard after all. Now, do you know anything about that?
GET IN HERE GODDAMMIT!
Israel's legal representation, the firm of Culpepper, Brody and Reed, which is currently the subject of a joint SEC and Treasury Department probe, were left holding the bag after he skipped bail. Over three- quarters of a million dollars on a bond that's set to expire in less than a day. Rupert Reed, one of the firm's partners, has learned of Israel's whereabouts and dispatched a local bondsman by the name of Jack Dupree to pick him up and return him to Las Vegas... that can't happen.  We have a Gulf Stream standing by at Reagan International to transport you two to Lake Tahoe.  It's very simple gentlemen. Valacchi, Fratiano, Gravano -- no former witness against the mob has been as crucial or has brought more to bear on the potential dissolution of The La Cosa Nostra, than Buddy Israel.
It wasn't elective. It was undertaken to save his life. And it wasn't cosmetic, it was reconstructive... Look at the date of the first procedure.
The same year that Sparazza murdered Agent Freeman Heller...
Yeah... Sid?
Nah, nuthin' on my end --
The try t'wild out on my boo and it's on and crackin'! I'm layin' niggas out.
Naw baby, they heard about that Triad hit, the work ya'll put in and they recognize the skills. And this ain't no tryout, tap-dance "show us your shit" thing neither -- if ya'll want this then I'mma go git it for 'ya.
Yes.
Why did you agree to come here?
Oh, that's a relief.
That's right.  And we all have to sleep, eventually.
Why?
I'll be right back.
As I said, it is beyond our comprehension.
How could she not be real?  I can smell her, taste her.  She does exactly what she did... it's not possible.
I don't think do.  It's not sleep; it's something else.  It's all around me.
I'm disgusting.
You're lying.  I'm not human.
Then you'll die.
We want to talk freely.
It's okay... I've never been a detective before either...
Not too sure about that.
No, no seriously!  There's a study done on this, you walk this way, the muggers are gonna single you out.
Hey.  This is my business.  Do I tell you your business.
They called here after you left...
Yeah.
I know.
Listen, I'll... see you again.
Absolutely.
Let 'em eat their hearts out.
I want you and Tommy to stay with my mother.
Me neither.
I can't do it, you know that... He's not gonna allow it anyway, Mike.  No way is he gonna let anybody walk out of that house alive, who can finger him.
I'm relieved at 4:00 A.M.
Yeah, I think so.
Uh, Uncle Ben, I--
No. No, that's okay.
Come on, laughter's the best medicine!
Lemme down, bugface!
Hmf-hrr?
I hate people with alliterative names.
I hate your relatives, I hate your coffee, I hate your shoes.
What's your problem?
Why?
Your records are older than you are.  Have you never heard of new wave?
Hi.  I've got sort of a hypothetical question.  Do you suppose the bite of a radioactive spider would transmit that spider's proportional strength and agility?
I mean, I suddenly have immense physical power, and the ability to crawl up walls--
Yeah, a psychiatric hospital. Listen, I'm serious--
Ach, theories!  This was first hand, experiential knowledge, the essence of the universe.
Luck.  The right place at the right time.
I don't think I'll be running into him.
I'll try. Thanks.
Bonkers.
Just drop me off here.
Any news on Dunbar?
In this barracks?
Who is it?
Who is it?
That's right.
Ask Security.  You tell him, Price. You've got me shadowed every minute of the day. Or haven't you found out yet?
Okay, Security -- what happened?
Yes, it would. Do we know each other?
Naturally. It would be rather awkward to have three men in one bunk.
They also smell of moth balls.  When were they issued? This morning?
Raus! Raus! All of you!
Who wants to eat? I just wanna get over there!
I don't care if they wear galoshes!
Let me go!
So what? There's other women!
Cut it out. Animal! I'll fix you up with a couple of those Russian women!
Sure, Animal! I'll get you over there!
It takes a gimmick, Animal, and I figured us a little gimmick.
Sharp. Sometimes I'm so sharp it's frightening.
I'll open mine, too.
Kill it, Duke. It's got us all spinning.
I still say this is my tag. Any objections, Hoffy?
With your mother's pull, how come you're not a chicken colonel by now?
Don't you know? Because I got my own ideas.  Let's have that civilian stuff.
What about the radio?
Give me the radio.
All right, gentlemen, I will find it myself. Now let's see.
Russian women prisoners?
Come on, let's get that mail. Anything for Stanislaus Kuzawa?
Full disruptors.
Wait. The Bozeman,why did it change course?
It has occurred to me on several occasions. But I believe this may be the appropriate time.
That is true. However, I believe my growth as an artificial lifeform has reached an impasse. For thirty-four years I have endeavored to become more "human"- to grow beyond my original programming. And yet I am still unable to grasp such a simple concept as humor. This emotion chip is the only answer.
I am quite...preoccupied with concern about Geordi.
I hope so, sir.
What happened to you?
Oh, of course.
That's right.
I hadn't planned on it.
I always do.
We think they were looking for something- they practically tore the place apart.
You want me to contact Starfleet?
No, sir.
What I can't get out of my mind is the image of Rene- my nephew. I just can't believe he's gone.
What if I told you I found a new truth?
Time has no meaning there. The predator has no teeth.
Plasma coils...is there any way we can use that to our advantage?
Yes. He has a long journey ahead.
Dr. Marcus, it's your planet.
Underground deposit?
There's only one thing it could be... Short range scan.
It would seem that Grissom was destroyed by an enemy attack.
Logic indicates that is the case.
That may be difficult...
I have already made one transmission too many...
Request permission to beam aboard immediately.
None that I can detect, sir.
Aye, sir!
Yes. And I know you.
You would have done the same for me.
Because... the needs of the one outweighed the needs of the many.
Yes, sir. It's getting larger as we close in.
Approach control... this is Enterprise. Ready for docking maneuver.
Report status!
Spare me your human platitudes, Kirk. I have been to your Government. I have seen the Genesis information, and your own report.
"Met his death"?  How could you, his friend, have assumed that? Why did you leave him on Genesis! Spock trusted you -- and you denied him his future!
You missed the point, then and now... Only his body was "in death," Kirk! And you were the last one to be with him.
Then you must know that you should have come with him to Vulcan.
Because he asked you to! He entrusted you with his very essence -- with everything was not of the body. He asked you to bring him to us -- and to bring that which he gave you: his Katra. His living spirit.
He would not have spoken of it openly.
Kirk, I must have your thoughts. May I join your mind?
Perhaps they wish to take you prisoner.
How is that...?
Peace and quiet appeals to me, Lieutenant.
You know what they say, Lieutenant. Careful what you wish for: you may get it.
Amazing! I don't know what to say --
Thank you.
Where <u>they</u> went. Saavik.
The order comes from Starfleet command, Dr. Marcus, direct from the General Staff.
I have my orders.
Mistake? We're all alone here. They waited until everyone was on shift-leave to do this. Reliant is supposed to be at our disposal, not vice-versa.
Ssssh!
I'm Doctor Marcus!
It's not much different from Enterprise.  When I was a guest aboard her some years ago, Captain Kirk kindly allowed me to memorize her technical manuals. And now, Mr. Chekov, let us review: You say you have no details of Project 'Genesis' ?
Inoperative.
Chekov, who is this man?
Scotty, let's have it.
He'll die -- !
I am understandably curious.
Yes.
The prefix code is 16309. All commands from each Starship bridge are relayed electronically; each ship has its own prefix combination code...
The ship -- out of danger?
Humor... that is a difficult concept ... it is not logical...
As your teacher Mr. Spock is fond of saying: I like to think there always are possibilities.
Aye, sir.
Trying, sir!
I'll try, Captain.
Aye, sir.
Back home, we call him the miracle worker.
Let's hope so, Bones. Mr. Sulu, set us down in Golden Gate Park.
That's crazy! Who would send a probe hundreds of light years to talk to a whale?
Captain, their call is being carried on an amplification wave of enormous power!
Negative. It's impacting on all our systems!
Shields, aye.
I was not.
What does that mean, exactly? Take their chances.
Tell me when the whales are going to be released?
Who do you think I am?
Mr. Sulu: full power descent!
Judging by the pollution content of the atmosphere, I believe we have arrived at the late 20th Century.
How will playing cards help?
I will, Admiral.
Hover on my mark, Mr. Sulu! Mr. Chekov, stand by de-cloaking -- Scotty, ready for power build up!  Mark, Mr. Sulu...
283 degrees... 15.2 kilometers...
About 60 feet, Admiral.
I suppose I can, sir; are you planning to take a swim?
Mr. Scott, don't make jokes, we are in danger of -
Mr. Sulu, if you please.
I demand to see the owners! I demand --
It's not our custom to have guests here at all, let alone hold anyone against their will.
I just... haven't gotten around to it yet.
The "mighty" Federation could learn a few things from this village...
Data doesn't breathe.
No.
It's nothing personal data. You have to remember these people have rejected technology. And you...
Until this week, that young man probably never saw a  machine, let alone one that walks and talks...
Another time.
This was too important for the Enterprise to be on the sidelines, Admiral...
Sir, Commander Worf and I have been working on several tactical plans to safely...
No, sir. But it wasn't easy... being among them...
Do you know how they were damaged?
The Son'a reports claim they didn't fire until after he malfunctioned.
Why would they fire at him without provocation?
Fail-safe?
So, you're saying he still knew the difference between right and wrong.
And yet he attacked us. And told the Ba'ku we were a threat...
On screen.
Commander Riker...
Ask them.
Beam him out!
Very well. We'll take an hour. Break out some rations...
Hmm, I should feel right at home with them...
Activating injector assembly.
Yes. But until then, you'll have to make do with what you've got.
It is impossible to imagine sensations for which I have no frame of reference.
And I need to control this ship. Let me into your mind.
I am unlike any lifeform you have encountered before. As an android, I am in complete control of my neural net. The information contained there cannot be forcibly removed.
Understood. Keep me informed.
Always am.
One minute to warp threshold...
I'm an old friend of Cochrane's... I wanted to see how he was doing.
Yes.
I think he was running a test on an old rocket engine... and one of the fuel cells burst.
Trade. Okay. The photographs... for a straight answer.  Who are you? And how do you know Zephram?
'Fraid not.
Population... thirty-five billion...  All Borg.
Onscreen.
Assign another team if you need to. I want to re-establish communication with the Captain as soon as possible.
Just a little queasy...
Right.
I'll keep that in mind.
Riker here.
The longer we wait, the less accessible the hostages will be, Mr. President.
I wish I knew. Uhura?
No way.  You see this?
In space, no one can hear you sweat.
I don't wonder. Stop me if I'm wrong but do we really have any way of knowing if this is the real you?
Yes.
Yes...
Those words WERE spoken by me.
Who else?
Quite right, Mr. Chekov. What is now required is a feat of linguistic legerdemain - and a degree of intrepidity. Before the Captain and Doctor McCoy freeze to death.
We must do this again soon.
Anything else you want to tell me?
Come on, Saavik, you COULD knock -
Right -
We have volunteered to rendezvous with the Klingon ship that's bringing Chancellor Gorkon here, and escort him safely through Federation space.
I'M going. You are going to be responsible for getting me out of this. Meantime we're not going to be the instigators of a full-scale war on the eve of universal peace.
Probably trying to figure out why we're reversing, wondering if we detect her.
Sir, I speak to you as a kindred intellect. Do you not recognize that a turning point has been reached in the affairs of the Federation?
You can't prove any of this...
What's left of it.
Aye, aye, sir.
But you didn't join a conspiracy.
Please, Beverly, this is hard enough.
I'm counting on it... We've been ordered to head to sector 3274. Starfleet is diverting the fleet to meet us there.
Sorry, sir.
We're about to find out... Power up disruptors and fire on my mark.
Fire!
How many of you did Dr. Soong make?
I would like to pick you up now. May I do that?
I know how he thinks.
Do you have life support?
Understood.
Sir?
What are you doing to Counsellor Troi?
That will never happen.
On screen.
Patience. Diplomacy is a very exacting occupation. We can wait.
The honor was mine. Captain Riker.
Come to dinner on Romulus tomorrow. Just the two of us. Or just the one of us.
I know.
In time.
I am.
Let's go.
They're holding position.
They will obey, Praetor.
Probably kids.
Thank you.
It's taken on a disguise.
It's made itself look like the woman's dead husband.
I don't know. Someplace called Elmo's. Look, I just wanted to tell you that I'm all right and I'm on my way home.
No. You'll want to ask a lot of questions I don't want to answer right now. I already have a ride.
Steering wheel.
Gear shift.
Dashboard.
Smile.
Yes.
Closed.
Shit!
I know that. But the buses don't go there.
That's easy. I'll explain that in a minute. This is your ticket. When you get on the bus here, the driver will take this part. You will ride to Omaha. When you get to Omaha, ask the driver. 'Salt Lake City, please. I do not speak English.'
I was afraid.
No. Get in.
I'm not sleepy anymore. Let's drive for a little while longer.
Nothing.
If you want to keep it, you can.
I will.
Sure.
Then why did they try and sneak in the back door? Tell me that. Why didn't they contact us first and say...
It was the husband. The police finally got a hold of the witness at work and showed him a picture of the woman.
What's all this squid shit?
Oh my God.  I don't believe this is happening.
What're you going to do?
No, Lenny.
You understand?  Attorney!  Right? Am I right?
Shutup a second!
Okay... what about Strickland?
Naawww.
Yeah.  Pretty zany, huh?  All this shit caused by a random traffic stop.  Hey... nothing means nothing. You know that.  Look around... the whole planet's in total chaos.  You gotta take what you can, while you can.  Cause some shitbird can come up and put a fuckin' .22 in the back a your head any second.
That would be between me and Faith, wouldn't it?
Coming with you.
No idea.
Yeah.  I'm ghosting pretty bad.
Mace, the guy had a knife.  To my throat.  In my living room. Relaxing might be right out, okay?!
No shit.  You got someplace in mind?
I can't tell you.  You've got to see.
Mace.  I know what you think about the wire.  But I'm asking you to do this.  It's that important.
You never told me.
No, it's not.
See you downtown.
Um... he was older.
To be honest, when I'm working, I don't look at faces much. He knew the guy's name.
The bearded guy, the creep. Oh, one other thing. Testa, if that's his name, he kept mentioning my feet. Said I had very pretty feet.
I'd appreciate it if you kept this to yourself.
This is Agent Mackelway.
Yes.
I didn't wait on him. Fifty or so, white, regular build, needed a shave -- that's all I remember.
He had an orange hat on.
Just step outside, sir. Now. Keep your hands where I can see them.
I spoke with Lloyd Daitz.
"Was?"
You suspected all along, suspected he was alive. That's why you came to El Paso.
How long ago?
You knew the arm slash was not "Zorro."
What did you think of the Suspect Zero theory?
Shut the fuck up or I'll shut you up.
Don't be too harsh.
Huh?
Of course he did. He came on to every attractive student. Which bothers you most: that he exploits suffering or that he came on to me?
No, Mack, I do not think you're a square and definitely not a nerd.
That's true.
What's that?
I found a peephole into Deviant World. I'm gonna reach in and yank some of those creeps out.
Not the way I can.
Don't confuse what we do with who we are.
I...
I'll give you a little hint. You're a smart guy, figure it out.
Yeah.
I screwed up twice, sir.
Four hundred and sixty, sir.
I wished to be reinstated at Computer Crimes. I was undiplomatic in my request.
I like working for the Bureau, sir. I like catching bad guys. It's all I care about.
It's over for you.
Just like that?
How was it hard?
Tell me about it...
Yeah.
It's been six months and I'm just starting to get over it.
It does.
Well, it still sucks, but you start to see that there are advantages to being single.
What what? What advantages?
...Four days..?
I believe it too. He really just wants her to be happy.
I understand.
I heard you might be moving back...
I'm not home and going out of town tomorrow for a week. Can't you talk for five more minutes?
Goodbye. I lov... 
I know. It's like the opposite of inbreeding. The hottest one percent from around the world migrate to this gene pool.
I've been around here six months and I still can't get over it.
Wait till summer. I swear, you can't leave the house. It hurts. It physically hurts.
Ah, there's the rub...
Oh boy.
She wasn't your type anyway.
So, what? Eleven?
What about you, Mikey? At least I got balls. You're always whining about some bitch who dumped you a year ago...
...Whatever. You're like a whining little woman. Big deal. You got a fuckin' number. Whoopee! You'll fuck it up...
Sorry. We got knocked out pretty quickly.
This is the hot new place, besides, you love pirates. Tell me Mikey doesn't love pirates.
You gotta love the pirates, baby. The pirates are money.
I should've said Renaissance, right? It went over her head.
"Age of Enlightenment". Shit. Like some waitress in a Las Vegas coffee shop is going to get an obscure French philosophical reference. How demeaning. I may as well have just said "Let me jump your ignorant bones."...
...It's just, I thought "Renaissance" was too Excaliber, it's the wrong casino. She would've gotten it, though...
I hope so.  We gotta go soon.
We didn't do so bad after all.
Yeah.
What a surprise.
That's so bullshit. This is so bullshit.
You are so money, and you don't even know it...
...it's on.
Yes, I understand I'm listening.
Barzini.
The gun will be there.
We gotta move...
Why do you come to me?  Why do I deserve your generosity?
What percentages for my family?
And what is the percentage of the Tattaglia family?
Should I bring him in.
It's been two years.  He's probably in trouble again.
I'll need him.
This one could seduce the devil.  A body! and eyes as big and black as olives.
This was a beauty.  Right, Calo?
And hair.  Black and curly, like a doll.  And such a mouth.
The cops have it locked in and I got my people there visiting Pop all the time.  What about the hit list.
I've tried calling and writing.  I want to reach Michael.
Tom, we're going to be legitimate all the way, and you're the legal man.  What could be more important than that.
Sure.
He's my father's godson; he owes him his whole career.
Goodbye.
You're right, kid, Clemenza is okay. It was Paulie.
On the three days Paulie was sick this month, he got calls from a payphone across from the old man's building.  We got people in the phone company.  Thank God it was Paulie...we'll need Clemenza bad.
Maybe.
The hotel, the casino.  The Corleone family wants to buy you out.
Meet my father, Herbert Richard Greenleaf 1st.
I don't know why people say this country's civilised. It isn't. It's fucking primitive.
What time is it?  Oh God! Do you always type your letters?  That should be two Ts.
This is so good of you.
No!
Okay, you get in. I'm like a prune anyway.
So tell me.
Really? To Italy?
Oh God, I don't think so.
Marge and I are getting married.
How?
I love Marge.
Tom, I don't love you.
I'm actually a little relieved you're going, to be honest. I think we've seen enough of each other for a while.
Did this place come furnished? It doesn't look like Dickie. Horrible isn't it? -- so bourgeois.
Where's Mr MacCarron?
Bird. That's jazz.
Tom, you startled me! You're back.
Yes -- I'm on a good streak, thanks.
Where's Dickie?
Ha. Did he say why?
What does that mean?
Is that what he said -- he wanted to be alone?
To the manner born.
You were at the Opera? Well, that explains -- yes I was there. I was there with Dickie.
Marge, I don't know you, so I have no right, but Dickie loves you. He's -- I think you'll find he's coming home to you.
He told me everything. I was supposed to meet him fifteen minutes ago, so I... I'm going to go now, I think. Unless he meant us to meet -- which would be a little cruel, wouldn't it?
Excuse me?
Hello Meredith.
Well, you've spotted me and so you get the reward.
Just kidding. Are you alone?
I am. I really am. And I've been travelling. I just can't seem to get that far north.
Thanks.
No I did not. I did not kill Freddie Miles and then kill Dickie Greenleaf. Is he accusing me?  Ask him if he's accusing me!
Just because he doesn't like Americans!
You're such a liar...
I want a .32. Revolver. And a palm gun. That .22 there.
I can believe that.
Oh, uptown. You know. Some joint. It ain't much.
I had a regular job for a while, days. You know, doin' this, doin' that. But I didn't have anything to do at night. I got kinda lonely, you know, just wandering around. So I decided to works nights. It ain't good to be alone, you know.
Yeah, well...  In a cab you get to meet people. You meet lotsa people. It's good for you.
Just people people, you know. Just people.  Had a dead man once.
He'd been shot. I didn't know that. He just crawled into the back seat, said "West 45th Street" and conked out.
I shut the meter off, for one thing. I knew I wasn't going to get paid. Then I dropped him off at the cop shop. They took him.
Oh, you see lots of freaky stuff in a cab. Especially when the moon's out.
The full moon. One night I had three or four weirdos in a row and I looked up and, sure enough, there it was -- the full moon.
No, Travis. You're a sweet guy and all that, but I think this is it. I'm going home.
No, I don't feel so good. We're just two very different kinds of people, that's all.
It's very simple. You go your way, I'll go mine. Thanks anyway, Travis.
I'm getting a taxi.
This is gotta be a game, right?
Ouch!
I'm great. Always set my fingers on fire. If you want to see another trick. I do this thing with my nose.
Ah, yes, the guy at the newsstand, Mr. Asbestos...
Is he Italian?
You sure he's not Italian?
Well, If he had been Italian, they could have been shot off. Sometimes the mob does that to teach guys a lesson, If they blow a job or something.
Don't be naive. They can't kill everybody. They have different punishments for different things. Like, if they kill a stool pigeon, they leave a canary on the body. It's symbolic.
I don't know. Maybe they don't leave a canary. Don't be technical. What I'm saying is if this newsstand guy's Italian and his fingers are gone, maybe he's a thief.
With the other hand, right?
I know that guy. His hand looks like a paw. An old Black guy, the newsstand at --
Show me how he did that again.
We call him Dough-Boy cause he likes the dollars. He'll chase a buck straight into Jersey.
You looking for some action?
All right.  You see that guy over there?  His name is Sport. Go talk to him. I'll wait here.
Where is home?
I don't know, sir. I don't follow political issues much.
Well, he should clean up this city here. It's full of filth and scum. Scum and filth. It's like an open sewer. I can hardly take it. Some days I go out and smell it then I get headaches that just stay and never go away. We need a President that would clean up this whole mess. Flush it out.
You would, huh?
My name is Henry Krinkle -- that's with a "K." K-R-I-N-K-L-E. I live at 13 1/2 Hopper Avenue, Fair Lawn, New Jersey. Zip code 07410.  Got that?
Great, hey. Thanks a lot.
That's just about the dumbest thing I ever heard, Wizard.
Neither do I, I guess.
Yeah. Sorry, Wizard.
Thanks.
What is happening?  Where's Mason?
It's all I could think of.
What's that?  Mason?
Mr. Chairman, as I understand it, the Fifth Amendment pertains to self-incrimination, and I can't incriminate myself because I've done nothing wrong.  Besides, incrimination is why you have Mr. Clyde working for you.
Go on home, folks.  And thanks for the welcome.
Eventually.  We were going to be  engaged... when you came back from  overseas...
No... I can't... I have to... I can't...
The witness need not be hesitant to say anything before this committee, as long as it's the truth.
Shhhhhh.
Nine and-a-half years...
Son, I think you loved the Bijou even more than I did.  You've got to remember that.  You've got to.
Did you... did you...
Did you fix the damn film?  It broke in the last reel.
Anybody take it?
Vultures...
It's possible.  I just don't remember.
I... no, I... I just can't...
Wouldn't blame him if he was.
What's his rent?
Well, that's not what they think.
You should keep track of your old school chums.  Turns out she eventually joined the communist party.  On top of which, she's Lucy Angstrom Hirschfeld now, and she happens to be a writer for "Studio One" on CBS.
So, our lawyers had a talk with the Committee's lawyers.  That Elvin Clyde fella won't be too happy about it, but we cut a deal. They cleared you -- and they're gonna thank you publicly for your testimony purging yourself.
Climb down off your cross.  They already knew about her.  She was subpoenaed six months ago! Who the hell do you think named you?
Sure.  Come on in.  I was just packing.
You look familiar, fella.  What's your name?
It's a lovely garden.
No. Just a few hours.
Well... something like that.  I'm sorry. I don't mean to sound so mysterious.
It gets a little chilly here at night sometimes. Especially if you're over near the bay.
No!
They're birds!
I don't know, honey.
I wish I could say. But if I could answer that, I could also tell you why people are trying to kill people.
It's nothing.
They're back!
Yes, very.
Yes.
I told you. We met yesterday.
Yes.
No. I only led her into believing I believed she was... Mother, it's really very complicated.
Mother, where did you go to law school?
I suppose so. Her father owns a big newspaper in San Francisco.
I know, Mother.
Yes, Mother.
I know, Mother.
Mother?
I think I can handle Melanie Daniels by myself.
I know exactly what I want, Mother.
But they'll be back.
Where can we go, Mitch? There's no place to go.
We'd never make it. They're probably all over the road.
If...  If... when we get to San Francisco...  If they're already there?
If they are?
I'm frightened, terribly frightened. I... I don't know what's out there, Mitch.
I started to say... inside...
We know what it is, Al.
Bodega Bay. He goes up there every weekend.
Up on the coast. About sixty miles north of here.
About an hour and a half on the freeway. Or two if you take the coast highway.
I'd hold the birds for him, but I'm going away myself. Someone's got to feed them, I suppose.
I'm awfully sorry.
Yes.
Why would I want to see you, of all people?
It was no trouble at all. I simply called my father's paper. Besides, I was coming up here anyway, I already told you...
I loathe you. You have no manners. And you're arrogant and conceited and... I wrote you a letter about it, in fact, but I tore it up.
None of your business.  Am I still bleeding?
I'm trying to get you to stay for dinner. We're going to have a lot of roast left over.
Cheers.
Mmm?
With my little sparrow leading team.
I thought they'd have stopped by now.
Almost two a.m.
How about you?
I have no idea.
No one called it a war!
That would hardly be possible.
Of course -- it's the soul of the business -- the pay --
It is a pity.
From the Municipal Council -- they're the bodies of paupers --
Who would believe that?  And you know, someone else might recognize her.  She was as well known as the Castle Rock.
It was a woman when we put her in.
Your son, ma'am?  He must have been a fine boy for the wee dog to love him so.
You're uncommon friendly tonight, Toddy. More like the old days.
I've drunk enough tonight.
You mean we would sell the bodies to the doctors together? Dig them up?
Burke them?
I come from Lisbon.
Aye.  He's a good lad.  That's why I ask you, MacFarlane.
Aye --
I'm not dying for your goddamn illusions. You got that? You think you and your girlfriend had some rosy future ahead of you? Bullshit. She was already bored, why do you think she was looking around? You're nothing, Corvis! Less than nothing.
A scar. On the arm. Of the man who planted this in Alex Corvis's car.
The scar.
My dad was right! He said you'd ruin her life.
No matter what happens... you're innocent... I promise...
You two are majorly demented. Anyone ever tell you that?
Honey. I just can't.
Erin. I know you think she's been talking to you.
Thanks -- I'm enjoying it right here.
What a brilliant idea. I never would have thought of it.
I think we've all been hearing too much about "space men."
Yes, I have!
I don't know, Bobby. I'm inclined to doubt it.
Velocity is the time rate of change of position.
We'll finish it tomorrow... Goodnight, Bobby.
Then why not a meeting of all the Chiefs of State?
Bobby and I have had enough excitement for tonight.
I've got a good lock on my door.  And Bobby's going to sleep in my room tonight.
Goodnight, Mr. Carpenter.
Back to the boardinghouse. I'll be safe there for the afternoon -- and I can keep an eye on Bobby. He's the only other person who knows anything about--
That's right.
In this case the secret wouldn't be worth much. He doesn't know the answer himself.
It's really quite simple... The three- body problem, you know.
Can't stand light?
The Prince of Darkness.
El Vampiro.
What?...
I will, David!
Chill out Edgar.
A big legal war wasn't going to improve anybody's situation.  We've all been through enough.  Besides I was raised better than that. Thanks for having us, Dad.
This is Michael.
Does that mean we are, or we aren't?
Then let's act like friends. Let's talk.  I know this is a new place, and --
Soon as I finish this comic.  Okay?
Lucy.
I'm not looking for a tape.  What I need is --
Do I look that needy?
No, no.  Just worrying about my boys -- as usual.
I thought you said they needed discipline?
Star.
What do you mean?
Me, too.
Michael's great.  I like Michael.
They'll be coming for <u>all</u> of us.
You're supposed to watch me and entertain me, and make me appreciate the brief but happy years of childhood.
He was protecting <u>you</u>!
Screw it, I'm going up anyway.
I've asked him to try and locate the site.  Okay with you?
Maybe.
I don't know who to trust.
Watch Clark.
Watch him close.  Ask him why he didn't kennel the dog.
If it did get to him.
Cut him loose?
We got morphine, don't we.
We'll see.  Let's try Clark.
I guess I'm the only one.
When was the last time you used it?
I am going after them.
Copper thinks they swallowed pieces of it during the fight.
It'll come.  It needs us.  We're the only thing left to imitate...  Give me a hand.
The generator!
What?!
Can't hear you.
What happened?
Yes.
I'm used to that.
No...
We have lost the capacity to reproduce.  But the species must continue.
When a creature shows too much independent thought we remove them from the gene pool.  We're breeding them for submission.  Soon they will be fully domesticated.
Yes.  Initiative and daring are not desirable traits in the Eloi.  But you should be happy for her.  She won't remember the creature she was.  She will... become.
I -- what are you?!
What's happening to the moon?!
No... let's walk through the city.
I have something for you...
For God's Sake, David --
You care for me.  And you're concerned.  And I have to start living my life again.  I hear it from Mrs. Watchit every day.
Hiding?
That's because I'm working.  You remember that?  You used to care about your work.
All right, all right -- here -- everything --
Why not?
You liked it there.
Learning was important?
Did you have fires at night?
It must have been safe.
It sounds like a wonderful place to live.
Do you have it?!
Very good.  Now if you will excuse us for a moment.
Dean Fulton...
And you've no idea where he went?
Don't act like I don't know what's real. [Beat] I'm not the one that's crazy here.
I know. [Beat] You killed me, didn't you?
I didn't kill myself. I died from a blow to the head. How'd it happen? I have to know.
I wish they'd skip the formality of this annual review and just cut our budget. Our silence on the matter should be enough to appease the civic conscience without wasting an hour we don't have.
Mom, this is the guy that drove us home that afternoon we were stuck on the highway. The guy you yelled at for no good reason...
I'm sorry for upsetting you, [beat] but I'm not lying to you.
[Beat] What?
[Beat] What?
Me neither. Who was the boy she was talking about, Eugene?
You think Lorenson kills you?
Let's see if they have an address for Becker. I also want to figure out more about the kid you helped her with.
Because that's the part I believe is true. You probably did help her somehow with the boy and Eugene's name did come up over and over again on the abstracts I pulled.
William, you're not making sense.
You're bleeding pretty bad there.
You thought my father was crazy?
Come on. Tell me what you do know.
Well, what time is it?
You still don't believe me, do you?
No. Listen to me...the kid, Eugene...
No. [Beat] I mean I found out while I was in it that my body's gonna be found in four days.
[Beat] Thanks.
Sure.
I'm sorry, Doll, I just didn't want you to be late.
There's two girls out there that had a chance, they had a chance...!  And you blew it for 'em.  Now they've gotten in some serious trouble, some very serious trouble and for at least part of it, I'm gonna hold you personally responsible for anything that happens to them.  I've got no feelin' for you.  But I may be the only person in the world who gives a rat's ass what happens to them and you're either gonna tell me every damn thing you know, so there's a small chance I can actually do them some good, or I'm gonna be all over you like a fly on shit for the rest of your natural life.  Your misery is gonna be my goddamn mission in life.  That's a sincere promise.
I know!  I'd tell you if I knew! Goddamn!  I know something happened, or she wouldn't have left.  I'm trying to remember everything!  Find that fucking kid.  He probably knows something.
You do?  Is he a funny uncle? 'Cause if he is, then he and I got somethin' in common.
Thelma?  It's me.
Are you in town?  This sounds long distance.
Louise, just tell me what the hell is going on here!  I come back, nobody knows where you are.  Is Thelma with you?  Darryl's been callin' here every half-hour sayin' he's gonna kill you both when you get back, he's goin' nuts.  I don't envy her if she is.
Maybe.
It's nothin' like that.
Yes.
In the back?
Am I in trouble?
Can't you tell when somebody's hittin' on you?
Maybe.
What?  Oh, I don't know.  Let me look.
I'm sorry.  I'm just not in the mood for company right now.  Here.  Take this map.  I need you to find all the secondary roads to Mexico from Oklahoma City.  I think we should stay off the interstates.  We're too conspicuous.
I don't want to go that way.  Find a way that we don't have to go through Texas.
You know how I feel about Texas... We're not going that way.
Thelma!  I'm not gonna talk about this!  Now find another way or give me the goddamn map and I will!  You understand?
Don't worry about it.  You want anything?
Let's get it over with.
We should have just ignored him.
Hit it.
Eeuww.
Gosh, didn't he say anything positive at all?
About two hundred and fifty miles.
You, too, sweetie, the best.
So you admit it?
Good-looking?
What?
Huh? But why did Healy?
No.
Loser? Woogie was all-state football and and basketball and valedictorian of his class.
What can I tell you? It's a healthier lifestyle down here, and it's easier to succeed when your head's clear. Those guys I worked with back in Boston, they were a bad influence.
Not for me, buddy. I don't drink anymore.
I don't know. I guess... it just seems that women today are more impressed by the mighty buck than by some schmo who spent the last seventeen years scraping by on Peace Corp wages.
Some buildings I'm working on.
Well, just until I get my PGA Tour card.
You're a movie buff?
Have you seen it?
A fucking moron.
Not to worry. So... see you tonight, right? Right?
So she's married?
Huh?
Three different guys?
Oh my.
She's in a wheelchair?!
What do you mean 'why'?
Who the fuck do you think you are making up that bullshit about me?!
Oh that makes a lot of sense. Why would I rat myself out?
You were following us?
Bet your ass I have. It's an important job, Neighborhood Watch is.
These ain't strangers, they're neighbors. This only picks up signals in a half-mile radius.
Meaning these are the people you live amongst, you got a right to know if they're creeps. For instance, did you know there's a guy down the hall cheating on his wife?
I confirmed it on the scanner. I knew something was up because Puffy used to bark like hell whenever he saw him and you know Puffy only barks at bad people.
So maybe I could find a nice gentleman to take you to the movies.
Love? Come on, I wouldn't call it love.
Well that's what I'm trying to figure out. How long have you known him?
Oh Jesus...
Yup, that's right. Junior prom... kinda.
Oh yeah, healed right up. No visible scars.
No short game.
All right, let's go.
Really?
Would you shhh! Mary's gonna hear us.
What do you mean?
Giddy-up.
Yes.
Of course. Our pledge can be relayed to any government official Secretary Khruschev sees fit to satisfy.
McNamara's on his way back here now. We need to pick the right ship. No subs. No armed boarding parties either. We need a little more time to figure this one out.
You can't take him out this late in the game.
Then talk to your brother, goddamn it. The two of you don't need any advice to get into trouble.
Kenny. It's over.
Time is of the essence.
The Soviets are in control of the SAMs. It's hard to believe with their centralized command structure that it could be an accidental launch.
Dean Rusk!
Acheson's scenario is unacceptable. And he has more experience than anyone.
Have to hope it's a signal that he'll back down on the real issue too.
And if this is a move to appease the hard line, then it may just be the bone he needs to regain control of his own house.
Rug samples.
Oh, yeah -- right.
-- did you understand me when I said that --
Goodbye.
Who the fuck is he?
That's right.
Yeah, alright, alright -- fuck you -- give a yuppie a badge and he wants to take over the world. Go get a tail on Eagle Bear, and stay with her. Cuz Jimmy's gonna show. And I want you to make the collar.
No way, Cooch.
Good question. Hardly sees anybody anymore. Hasn't left this place in twenty years. Did you bring some tobacco?
She's your sister?
They found prints at Blue Legs' place.
Yeah. It's time to beat the drum. You better wait here. He don't trust the white man.
If you ever need a place to come back to and listen to the trees a little... we'll be here.
Go ahead, Ray.
Okay, Ray. I'm coming in. If he starts to leave the area, move in. And hold him. Over.
No. Can't say that I have, Richard. Richard do you know why I'm here?
Yes, Washington sent me, Richard. They sent me here because this whole thing has been fucked. Do you know what I mean when I say this whole thing has been fucked, Richard?
Was there ever a girl who didn't like fighter pilots?
You know. The finger.
They know the rules... That's the deal. That's why you're up there. It's him or me. That's the price of admission.  It bothers you, why? You're part of it.   Everybody dies. Most people don't get to die for something.
I'm fine.
What?
He was a friend of mine. A good guy...great guy. It was my fault.
I was flying...my responsibility.
Maybe I shouldn't take it.
Not to me.
That's three.
Remember one thing.
Outside of this gate... I...am Top Gun.
Bring it left. Bring it left, You're high.
What is?
What?  What is it?
You're crazy. We're level.
You're not. We're level. Look at the instruments, we're okay!
We're not! Trust me! We're okay.
Goddamnit, Mav, you really are a slow learner. Don't worry, Fung, I've got it.
Oh, no. You did the flying, I'll do the talking!
Hey, see any controls back there?  And anyway...we beat the Son of a Bitch!
Right.
I guess that's what I'm doing, then.
Well, you'll just have to make do with him .
FIRE, OR CLEAR OUT, ICE.
YOU GOT TOO MUCH NOSE TO TAIL -- I'M COMING IN.
Tell me one thing.
How's it goin', Coog?
ENGAGING THE OTHER GUY. WOOD, YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.
He ain't got five kids to feed.
The Last Resort!  Quick!
Fuck you.
I know that.
Who told you to think?!  I don't give you enough information to think!  You do what you're told!!  That's what you do!
I'll do what I can.  It's getting messy in there.
Come on...put his head in place.
Oh, I get it; I'm dreaming!  And this is all part of that delightful vacation your company sold me.
Well, if this is my delusion, who invited you?
How much is Cohaagen paying you for this?
Bullshit.  It's all coincidence.
She's real.  I dreamed about her before I even went to Rekall.
That's right.
We don't have much choice then, do we?
Harry, you're making a big mistake! You've got me mixed up with somebody else!
What the hell is this?
You know I do.
Doug...
What's in the two week package?
How real does it seem?
Come on, don't bullshit me.
What about the guy you lobotomized...Did he get a refund?
What are you talking about?
I'm not a hooker!  That's my cover.
I just has a terrible thought...What is this is all a dream?
You can't fight'em that way...
Burt, can you hear me now?
I'd vote for outer space.  No way those are local boys.
Howdy, Rhonda.
You bet.  You gonna be staying up here?
Right.  We plan ahead.  That way we don't do anything right now.  Earl explained it to me.
He's only got one damn jacket. That's him, I'm telling you.
Fifteen lousy bucks.
You got <u>that</u> right!
Well, that's why Edgar never got down off that tower.
Don't worry about me, jerkoff.
Civil?  I'm civil.
Yeah, Heather, we got you.
Yeah, geography.
Like <u>what</u>?!  There's nothing left that'll make it to the mountains!
True.
Correct.
Sustained.
What about entrapment?
I specialize, Roger...
I'm not a kid anymore, I can't be all over the map --
So go take your job on Wall Street.
Hey. You plan to be a criminal defense attorney, know this going in: Everybody's guilty.
A Complaint Follow-Up form.
"Cecil Stipe"? Have we seen any affadavit with that name?
...What do you mean?
But what?
That's why I hate experts.
Hey -- you believe what you want. Shu Kai Kim is innocent.
You know how I know? 'Cause Reynard says he's guilty, and Reynard's full of shit! Look --
Neither.
I didn't put him in a wheelchair. Reynard did. He can get around without one -- it's all in my report.
I guess he... wanted you to think he was... somebody he wasn't.
Maybe... because someone's afraid.
I don't know. The truth, maybe.
About Chinatown. What went down.
You tell me, man.
How can I tell you what I don't know!
I don't know shit, man! Goddammit --
They g-got the wrong g-guy.
I always t-tell the truth.  That's why I'm here.
That's big of you, Bob.
The same three detectives on the Jimmy Chin case.
-- What trial?
No! They g-got the wrong guy! I saw it! The killer wasn't Chinese.
Here he comes.
Thank you, Carl.
Maybe I just live here, what do you think about that?
You can tell J. Edgar that I was at a party and I got fifteen fuckin' witnesses.
Teresa Banks.
I've thought about that. I think her death is what you would call a "freak accident".
Agent Desmond, would you hold the finger for me. There's something up there.
He's not the murderer.  But he's a bozo.
Donna, are you my best friend?
YES YOU DO, DONNA. What a downer you are!!!
Laura, no, I'm not. I'm not Bob.  Poor Laura. I wish I could help you.
Not now.
Okay.  Oh god, it's Johnny Horne's birthday today.
I can't tonight.
I just can't, James. I can't do it.
What were you doing in my room?
I had to see Bobby. I know you really don't like Bobby, but there was a problem and I didn't think you would understand.
I'm sorry, Mom.
A friend from school.
They don't call them lovers in high school, Leland.
How would you know if Bobby didn't give her that?
If Leo comes here, he won't believe that I am out doing the "Meals on Wheels".
Frank Galvin's... who's calling please? Bishop Brophy's office...
Huh!
What did these people do when her heart stopped?
'Code Blue,' what does that mean...?
Why wasn't she getting oxygen...?
Tell me one?
She THREW UP IN HER MASK. Let's cut the bullshit. Say it: She THREW UP IN HER MASK.
In your opinion, what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye?
Now, Dr. Towler's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes. In your opinion is his estimate correct?
That's perfectly all right. I'm kind of rushed. Do you mind if we walk while we talk?
You're really...  You, are you the one they told me was the nurse?
Mrs...
Yes.
That's a wonderful profession. My daughter-in-law's a nurse. What did you do, stop?
Thank you, your Honor, I'll continue. Dr. Thompson. Did you examine Deborah Ann Kaye last night at The Northern Chronic Care Facility?
What...?
We, we... No... we just had a small reversal in the case...  I have some, uh... I have some work to do...
They, uh, they got to my witness.
Let me talk to Mickey.
Dr. Halpern's taking all his...
He's... you can't reach him, Sir. He's in the, on some island in the Caribbean, they don't have a phone.  He'll be back in a week...  If you'd like Dr. Halpern's number...
Yeah? And what are you going to do tonight?
...one of the other nurses?
All right. Who wasn't in the O.R.?
Yes.
Yes, that's correct.
Yes.
Yes, the roving nurse...
We, we were rather busy...
As I've said we had some more...
We had rather more important things on our mind than taking notes.  We were trying to restore her...
...we were trying to restore her heartbeat.
We'd gone to 'Code Blue,' we were administering electro...
Then our first target will be the initial landing place outside Los Angeles.
There's only about one explanation for a thing like this..Got a pin?
I feel like I did one time when I was small.  Awful scared and lonesome...I'd wandered off - I've forgotten why - but the family and whole crowds of neighbors were hunting for me.  They found me in a church.  I was afraid to go in any place else.
How could it happen to everybody's watch together?
It's always been a good persuader.
D.O. to number three..come in.
Okay.  Send the tanker in, but you stand by until that thing cools off. Over.
Well, there's some fellows fishing at Pine Summit might be interested.  They probably saw it come down.  I'll let 'em know...What's it look like?
I don't know.  A couple months.  Why?
I don't follow.
Chase, you'd better come home.
Chase, it's Dylan!
He was just here!
Everything is not fine!
Say how they find their way back home.
Trying to get up...trying to get into our world.
Read me some?
Steady...
Dunno.  Just have this feeling today...
Interestingly enough, in the dreams there is one person.  A gatekeeper, so to speak.  Someone Freddy's got to get by before he can enter our world.  It's you, Heather.
Dramatically speaking it makes perfect sense.  You played Nancy, after all, the first to humiliate and defeat him.
But it was you that gave Nancy her strength.  So to get out he has to come through you.  And it's inevitable that he'll hit you at your most vulnerable points...
Your father?
You miss him.
Mr. Lawford, stand by to ease the mainsheet.  Rick, get on the jib sheet.  George, John, Philip, Tim and Dick go aloft to unstop the forecourse.  George will show you what to do.  Tod, show your men the forward pinrail and stand ready on the buntlines and clewlines. Forecourse first... work upward.
Yes sir.
My old man split along time ago.  It doesn't mean anything.  You just take care of number one that's all that matters.
Yes you could.  You did.  This is all you.  Nobody else.
I guess.
Fine.
Look, I appreciate, you know, the concern and all, but like he said, I can take care of myself.
Who?
Jesus, you never told them?
You can't run from the wind son. You trim your sails, face the music and let the chips fall.  Bill, let's close her up, dog, tight.
I thought we'd have a better chance if I headed into the wind so we could spill air from our sails.
Well, we've come to give our boy a little break from the monotony.
Spirits have a way of bringing that out.
They're in a hurry to grow up.  They don't know about consequences or responsibility.  That's being sixteen too.  I promise you one thing...
They'll know about it in the morning.
Shut up donut.
What is it... the secret?
What?
No.
He climbed when he was ready.
Don't mind him, Chucky.  You're talking to a guy whose idea of big romance is a palm full of Vaseline.
No way... GET OUT!!!
Forty bucks...
Real good, Chet... It's been awhile.
No... She's fine. Back home.
Set one up.
United States Marine issue, before they made the unfortunate switch to the less dependable nine millimeters. I have it here, in my briefcase.
He is my sponsor. The General is the head of the secret police of Honduras.
Marietta, settle down now darlin'... I want what's best for her, too - like I said, I'll do what I can to bring her home.
You ain't actin', mama.
I can't hardly understand you when you talk with one of them Mores in your mouth.
Yeah?
You think of the weirdest damn things to say sometimes, peanut. Ain't we been doin' a pretty fair job this far?
At Pee Dee, all you think about is the future, you know? Gettin' out? And what you'll do and what you'll think about when you're on the outside again.
It ain't altogether terrible just to let things go along sometimes. Lula, I done a few things in my life I ain't too proud of, but I'll tell ya from now on I ain't gonna do nothin' for no good reason. All I know for sure is there's more'n a few bad ideas runnin' around loose out there.
Maybe two, three months after Juarez. I was visitin' my cousin, Junior Train, in Savannah, and we were at some kid's house whose parents were out of town. A girl comes up to me that was real tall, taller than me.
Yeah, it's a real problem for me, Sailor, you know? When I went in that drugstore by the restaurant in Biloxi? I saw 'em by the register and the girl throw 'em in. I'm not big on resistin'. So what about a leech?
I got one on me at Lake Lanier. Lifeguard poured salt on it and it dropped off. Felt awful. He was a cute boy, though, so it was almost worth it.
Well, I ain't upset about it, darlin'. Just give me an odd feelin' there a minute, is all.
It's me who's wastin' time, Sailor, bein' with you.
Leave me be for a minute? Mama gets all insane and then I see you practicin' your individuality and personal freedom with some oil-town tramp. How you figure I'm gonna feel?
I'm afraid she is, baby.
I know you ain't particularly pleased bein' here.
Boys frightened, Lula. This ain't no good.
It's a mistake, honey. You two go on. I'll walk back to the depot.
He ain't never known me, Lula, so there ain't much for him to forget. Not seein' each other for six years makes it next best to simple for us, too.
What makes sense, is all.
I don't understand this... I don't understand this one bit. He was supposed to meet me right her in this lobby. Somethin' bad has happened - I jus know it.
HELL NO!!! That's the last thing we need... A buncha cops runnin' around.
No.
So I hear.
He's right, you look horrible.
She left me. Crabs.
This morning. I found a note in the kitchen.
Back up. Go out the other way.
Hey, I heard all about it -- the parents, the grandparents, the China town thing -- and I believe you, okay? That's why we're here. Now go get dressed.
Call it a hunch.
You did.
So I hear. You've also been smoking a lot of marijuana, I understand.
How long have you been having them?
How long have you been smoking marijuana?
That's probably not the problem, then. What about your lifestyle. Any major changes recently?
And your wife left you.
I spoke with the woman who saved your life. You're lucky she came along when she did.
No sweat. Only do me a favor?
Stop calling me Vernon.
A little.
It's colder in there.
He's dead, James. Believe me, I know a dead dog when I see one.
I put you on the floor.
I thought you might -- I don't know -- swallow your tongue or something.  I guess you really miss her, huh?
Shit, James, you're hungover. What do you think's the matter with you?
Smoke the rest of that joint, James, and you can start on the box.
The hell I am.
I never said that.
I didn't mean it that way.
Shut up, James. You're annoying. Carrie and Howard don't know what the fuck they're talking about, okay? The entire class combined -- including the lovely Hannah Green -- has about one tenth of one percent the talent you have, okay?
That's why she hates me. That's why she makes me sleep in the basement.
I thank you.
I hope that isn't true. We need all the downy innocents we can get.
It beats 'What's your major?'
She's left before...
Totally. I'm sorry. A lot was happening this morning. Can you talk?
Would Walter really press charges?
Why yes. How did you know?
It's Grady, Walter.
GRADY Tripp. English Department.
I have... eight-fifteen. That's not right, is it?
This is important.
I... I...
I'm in love with your wife.
Sara. I'm in love with her.
As a heart attack.
No, I'm going ho --
Something wrong with that?
I like the noise.
No thanks.
I don't want to see any goddamn pictures.
Is that right?
Why not?
The mother sure has her hands full.
Have a seat.
Fairy tales?
No.
Woodsman?
I don't know.
Little Red Riding Hood.
What?
Why's that?
Yeah, Mary-Kay, I think I do. Thanks a bunch for the advice.
What will happen if I do?
I don't feel anything.
She was born after they put me away. How can I have feelings?
Have to talk about something.
I'm not afraid. I'm just saying that Carlos has a thing for his daughter, and if he isn't careful he's going to suffer.
I'm not that crazy.
If I'm not, then what the hell am I doing here?
You know why. It's part of the parole deal.
Talking to you is like riding on a merry-go-round.
I see my sister.
Are you okay?
K through sixth.
I like the noise.
You must hate it.
I suffer from insomnia.
When I do sleep, I sweat a lot. Usually I get nightmares and wake up screaming.
No. Never again.
I'm not scared.
Maybe you should be.
Nothing.
I'm alright, I'm dealing.
Yeah, okay.  Okay.
I don't know.  Divorce ain't final.  Forgot to take it off.
Bud, something really important is happening here.
Who's hysterical?  Nobody's hysterical!
Can we negotiate later?  There's Big Geek.
How?
We've only got one suit.
Aaargh!!  I'm freezing!
Okay... Hippy's not going... McWhirter, you can run Little Geek.
Why bring it here?
You watch yourself.
Give me that!!
Gotcha, Cab Three.  Who is that?  That You, Lindsey?
How deep?
He's hallucinating badly.
Yes, fairly well. But I went to bed last night planning to do some thinking about a number of things ... instead, I fell asleep.
And you say that came from Lisca Bianca?
Look... I'd like to get back to Lisca Bianca.
But even here we were supposed to find who knows what... And all we bring back with us is a crate of cigarettes.
And that's what I say, too. We could have all been killed.
Yes.
And why did you drop them?
I was only joking, really... Can't I make a joke? And now you've got to tell me why you don't want to.
To do what?
But aren't you tired? I can just about manage to stand on my feet!  Raimondo!
To the shark.
But why?... What if it starts to rain?
This is Claudia, Anna's friend...  You've never met my husband, have you?
Answer me, why don't you try posing? I'll paint you a beautiful portrait.
But I want to paint you. You appeal to me more.
No. The owners are in Australia.
From Panarea. Why?
I detest it. But, after all, what can you do... It's the latest...and I try my best to adapt myself.
Oh, for Heaven's sake.
Agnes...
Why does it matter whether you're fat or not...
... You needn't worry about being attractive here.
He loves you the way you are.
Who told you this?
Why?
Agnes...
Who tells you these things?
That's not what he meant.
Agnes dear, Heaven is not a place where...
Would you like to talk about it?
Why should they?
Do you remember the night they said it came?
How were you sick?
Did it hurt?
Where?
And what did you do?
And what happened?
And then what?
In the middle of all the pain?
Where did the baby come from?
The baby they made up.
Is that where they say it came from... ?
Where'd it come from before that?
After God... before the waste-paper basket.
Agnes, how are babies born?
Yes I do,  but I want you to...
Then let's talk about something else...
Agnes...
Would you like to ask them?
Just that... you ask and I'll answer.
Anything.
I'm not sick.
That's because you keep reminding me. If you go away then I'll forget.
Everyone's unhappy, you're unhappy aren't you?
Answer me!  You never answer me.
Only you think you're lucky because you didn't have a mother who said things to you and did things to you that maybe weren't always nice but that was because of me, because I was bad, not her.
I don't know which one 
Of me. Oh... God!  My God...  Water... it's all water...
They can't hear me that's why.  Oh God... I don't wanna...
It was alive wasn't it?
What about Roger? He's free.
Yes... I...
... Thank you.
How dare you think I'm in a position to be pressured...
I'd like yours too.
NO... no... I said leave her alone.
They are?
And hurry, they're not looking too happy.
No, she'll only reject me in the end and I'll be frustrated.
No, I know the psychological pattern and it plays hell with me drum skins.
I suggest you just give him the photos and have done with it.
If I let you have your own way, you little rascal, will you respect me?
Well, it must be catching. He's given it to the champ here.
Well ... what's the matter with that?
You can learn from books.
Out where?
Books are good!
Parading?
Well, I <U>am</U> living, aren't I?
Eh ... you're a bit old for that sort of chat, aren't you?
Aaah ... stop picking on me... you're as bad as the rest of them.
What's that mean?
Oh ... I dunno.
Yeah ... that's right.
Yeah ... what's in it for me?
Yeah ... a bloomin' book!
Before you go, I think it's only fair to warn you about me Grandson ... don't let our Paul have his own way all the time, 'cos if you do he won't respect you!
Here, Pauly.
He's got you worried, then?
Nothing, he's trying to brainwash me and give me personality doubts ... oh, he's a swine but a clever swine, mind.
It's all right for you, you couldn't get a pen in your foot, you swine.
Aye, let's try the dressing room.
Your Grandfather pointed out Shake was always being taller than me just to spite me.
Y'what?
I don't need you to defend me, y'know, Norm.
Oh ... he's nursing a broken heart.
Yeah, but he insisted on us bringing him to the station.
Sandy, scan the whole sky.
Receiving.
Take care.
Yes.  There are two points of salient interest.  Number one: it is highly systematized, indicating intelligent origin.  Number two: certain sounds are inconsistent with the human palate.
Jay, we've got a problem.  I was wondering if there was any way you could shortcut the repairs and give us immediate takeoff capability.
The computer's translated the alien signal, and it's kind of alarming.
It couldn't translate the whole thing, only three phrases.  I'll just read it to you the way I got it:  "... HOSTILE... SURVIVAL... ADVISE DO NOT LAND... "  And that's all it could translate.
Is it alive?
Just hold us together till we're in space, that's all!
Yeah... well, maybe he should have.  I mean, you brought the goddamn thing in here.  Maybe <u>you</u> deserve to get slapped.
It wouldn't come.
Don't be an idiot.
What we really need is some red meat in here for bait.
What is it -- I can't tell anything --
Oh... God...
I've got an idea, but you're not going to like it.
Well... this rock rotates every two hours.  The sun should be coming up in about 20 minutes.
Sun will be down in a minute.
They're from a dead civilization; they're spores from a tomb.  God knows how long they've been here.
Just a second.  Those aren't water vapor clouds; they have no moisture content.
Well, it's finally happened.
Well... it's obviously intentional... some kind of attempt at communication... maybe it's a symbol that means something to them...
They seem native to the planet.  It's got an atmosphere and a dense gravity.  It's dead now, but once it must have been fertile.
Once we kill the thing we won't need the food any more -- we can go straight into hypersleep.  Also, it sounds like that thing is already doing a pretty good job on our supplies; it may be fouling them all.
Then that tomb... must have been some kind of fertility temple... where they stored their eggs, and maybe held mating rituals...
Now.  If we can get it into the boat, we won't have to blow it up -- we can just eject it into space.
Well, just keep looking.  It's gotta be... whoa, Jesus!
Okay, give me the numbers.
You win some, you loose some.
No, but I got something that might interest you.
About thirty minutes.  Those are slimmed-down tanks, so no stopping to admire the scenery.
We've dumped the whole data-base from one of the cleaning remotes into the helmet. It'll project the route through the sewer system onto the inside of the glass as you go.
I've seen this mother, De Vries.  We can bag it, no problem.
C'mon De Vries.  Think of the bonus.
It's alright, it's cool...
No, he's stopped; he's totally still. Just take it nice and easy, babe. Nice and easy...
How tight are these shafts?
Looks like it.
Not too much of the socializing type, then?
Ackland?  I don't know him well enough to say.  If we were back on Earth we could run him though an Aldhoven test and find out for sure. There's not much we can do out here.
You should hit the sack, too.
What time's sundown?
Give me a yell is something happens.
D-day.
And tomorrow morning you will have won your beachhead on the shores of Immortality...
Are you that sure of tomorrow?
Frankly - yes.
I don't know what I take you for anything...
I'm sure you mean something by that, Addison, but I don't know what...
I never intended you to be.
You can have one at Max's.
Why not?
Max has gone to a great deal of trouble, it's going to be an elaborate party, and it's for you.
It's the same thing, isn't it?
You're being childish.
Gable. Why a feller like that don't come East to do a play...
Miss Caswell, at the moment, is where I can lend no support - moral or otherwise.
Being violently ill to her tummy.
Maybe just a little around the edges.
Call me when you get in...
Clyde Fitch, thought you may not think so, was well before my time!
I don't think that's funny!
Twenty minutes!
Stage-struck kid... she's a young lady - of qualities. And I'll have you know I'm fed up with both the young lady and her qualities! Studying me as if - as if I were a play or a set of blueprints! How I walk, talk, think, eat, sleep!
Stop calling her a kid! It so happens there are particular aspects of my life to which I would like to maintain sole and exclusive rights and privileges!
For instance - you!
- guilty.
What about her teeth? What about her fangs?
Cut! Print it! What happens in the next reel? Do I get dragged off screaming to the snake pit?
That suddenly makes the whole thing believable.
Eve. Eve Harrington.
No thanks, Birdie.
Imagine. All this admiration in just one room.
I might.
Try...
No, Eve, I won't forget...
Over my dead body...
I was dreadful, Miss Channing, believe me - I have no right to be anyone's understudy, much less yours...
Very becoming. It looks better on you than it did on me.
Quite sure. I find it just a bit too - too "Seventeenish" for me...
There's the script to go back to the Guild-
- and those checks or whatever it is for the income tax man.
It seems I can't think of a thing you haven't thought of...
Eve...  ... by any chance, did you place a call from me to Bill for midnight California time?
Yes, dear. You forgot all about it.
Yes, I guess you were. It - it was very thoughtful of you, Eve.
It's just that you get me so mad sometimes... of all the women in the world with nothing to complain about-
Yes, it is! You're talented, famous, wealthy - people waiting around night after night just to see you, even in the wind and rain...
They're your fans, your audience-
We've all seemed a little tense lately...
We're never deeply angry, we just get sore. The way you do. We know you too well...
You're Margo. Just - Margo.
Loud.
What a way to die - trying to get an actress to the theater in time. Tell Max I want to be buried with royalties...
I have no possible interest in anything she'd have to say.
... Among so many quiet qualities.
I have no intention of having an accident!
How about me what?
Yeah?
For the paper, no; for us, plenty.  I waited a long time and finally this big guy--I guess a bodyguard-- he left and I knocked and she remembered me, we talked awhile.
--she was panicked, Carl--every time I mentioned Watergate, you could tell.
It was there. I just don't get it; a CREEP secretary being scared, that's one thing. But what does the wife of one of the most powerful men in America have to be afraid of...?
You mean, who's going to play the mean M.P. and who's going to be the nice one?  Whichever.
You want me to be the bastard.
It makes a crazy kind of sense-- remember that initiation rite they have at the White House? Each new member of the President's staff has to prove his guts by getting an enemy of Nixon.
Could have won him a fraternity paddle with a White House seal.  God knows it worked.
So I guess you could say that we screwed up, but we weren't wrong.
That's right.
We've just been talking to Young--
Lot of pressure at the Star.  Carl, when we got married, you were four thousand dollars in debt; when we split, you were solvent. That may prove to be the outstanding single achievement of my life, and now look at this.  How much did the damn bike cost?
You're two months behind--you got enough to cover?
Give me your checkbook then.
'Cause I'm not calling out from the phone company anymore--  --I think the place is bugged.
What do you want to know?
My big civil rights buddy--  --boy, if John Mitchell was after your phone records, would you be screaming.  What're you onto?
And that makes anything you do OK, is that it?
It was accurate, but I can't get a fuller listing for you--all Barker's phone records have been subpoenaed.
A Miami D.A. The guy doing the investigating is named Martin Dardis. 
--let me put it this way: I'd have no problem if you did.
I don't know titles.
I assure you, there's nothing mysterious involved.
So?
Total manipulation. I suppose you could say they wanted to subvert the Constitution, but they don't think along philosophical lines.
--don't concentrate on Segretti or you'll miss the overall scheme too.
Follow every lead--every lead goes somewhere--
--don't you miss the grand scheme too.
Nationwide--my God, they were frightened of Muskie and look who got destroyed--they wanted to run against McGovern, and look who they're running against. They bugged, they followed people, false press leaks, fake letters, they canceled Democratic campaign rallies, they investigated Democratic private lives, they planted spies, stole documents, on and on-- don't tell me you think this was all the work of little Don Segretti.
Yes, yes, everything. There were over fifty people employed by the White House and CREEP to ratfuck-- some of what they did is beyond belief.
I was being cautious.  You can safely say more then fifty...
You call me in on my day off because some idiots have broken into local Democratic Headquarters--tell me, Harry, why should I be smiling?
Preliminary hearing at Superior Courthouse?
Anyone but Bernstein.
--remember Toronto, Harry.
I don't get it--you were the one who wanted to fire him.
--well and good, but when will he say it on the record.
--I already get the Post. I don't need another subscription.
The what to what?
I'm not Miss Abbott.
Finch, you can be the one to date a nearly-dead insane chick.  Eat your damn imitation hot dog.
Uh-huh.
Just enjoying my exhilarating first lacrosse experience.  You like, "kicked butt."
You can't sing at the competition.
...it's okay, you should do whatever makes you happy.
What?
You mean...and orgasm?
Well...I'm pretty sure I've --
But that one time --
Well of course I'd want to give her that.  I mean, what do you think, I don't care about her?
Of course.
No, "Charming" is old.  "Older" is <u>really</u> old.  "Youthful mind" is dead.
Went home to shit.
You fuckin' rule!
It's not what it looks like!
What, you think I don't know how to get myself off?  Hell, that's what half of band camp is!  Sex ed!
Oh that's really reassuring.  And don't call me Nova anymore.  I'm a fraud.
I thought so.
Oh no.
Vicky -- do you think, maybe...it's time for us to take the next step in our relationship?
Yeah, it's such a perfect evening. Isn't this how you've always pictured it?
No, I don't not love you.  I like, I know that we've definitely got <u>something</u> between us.  Something good. Something special.
I didn't say that.  I mean, love, it's like a term that gets thrown around. People say things, they get married, have kids, and then what?  It's like they call it off, going "I was wrong."
I want to hear you say it.
Oh shit dude, the L-word!
Nah, you get kind of dizzy though.
Stifler!!
Thanks.
You try to be a good sport, and look what happens.
A-duh... You're a werewolf. And we, as your victims, have to walk the earth until your curse is lifted.
Come on. I'm from New York - the "shoot me" state. Don't wait up.
Okay. But I'm back in half an hour.
Andy! No!
It was you... That night in the tunnels. You. You did this to me.
That's the scar where I stabbed you! Oh God... You deliberately took me down there so you could... God, I can't believe it!
After the revolution, the Paris cemeteries overflowed. They dug up all the old bodies and brought them here. Seven million people. Mostly very poor.
Well, they are French.
Yeah? In New York we got an expression too. Goes like this...
Cure!? Ha-ha-ha!
You think it's silly. But do you realize that young man is actually in a deep sleep?
He's on a new drug called ZBH, or "Daydream". It allows the user to be fully alert and mobile while he's dreaming. He is literally conscious and unconscious at the same time.
You sure it's not just 'coz you jerk off too much?
I can't believe this. Why don't you go down in the tunnels and find the goddamn... animals that attacked my uncle?
Allo?
You never heard the story of Saint Severin driving the werewolves from Paris?
What, you think everyone's as ignorant as you?
Well, I don't have any money . . .
I'm sorry. . .  I'm. . .
Now just get off the train.
Yes - If I can't convince Sophie, I'll never be able to see Tatiana....
No, it wasn't a bat! I saw this horrible man - I remember him, I think...
I cursed then all!
Ew. . .  the honest type.
What do you mean?
Young man, I...
This guy, on the Johnny Carson show.
Well, I'm getting tired of it. I need your attention.
Well, he's spitting on my neck! You know, he's spitting on my neck when he talks.
Oh... no, no, no, no, uh, uh. No.
Oh, well, let's see, there was Dennis, from Chippewa Falls High School.
I'll getcha a piece.
Do I drive? Uh, no, I gotta-I gotta problem with driving.
Yeah. I got, uh, I got a license but I have too much hostility.
Nice car.
You keep it nice.  Can I ask you, is this-is this a sandwich?
You know, I gotta get there and begin whining soon... otherwise I- Hey... well, are you busy Friday night?
Oh, I'm sorry, wait a minute, I have something. Well, what about Saturday night?
Oh, you... you're very popular, I can see.
Gee, boy, what do you have? You have plague?
Yeah, I meet a lotta jerks, too.
think that's, uh-
You're gonna sing? Do you sing? Well, no, it isn't  No kidding?  this is my first time. Oh, really? Where? I'd like to come.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no! No, I'm interested!
No, so help me.
That's okay, 'cause I know exactly what that's like. Listen-
you're gonna like night clubs, they're really a lotta fun.
You are extremely sexy.
Unbelievably sexy. Yes, you are. Because... you know what you are? You're-you're polymorphously perverse.
Uh... uh, you're-you're exceptional in bed because you got -you get pleasure in every part of your body when I touch you.
Yeah, but that's not-that's no good. I want the whole thing.
Well, it ruins it for me if you have grass  because, you know, I'm, like, a comedian-
so if I get a laugh from a person who's high, it doesn't count. You know-'cause they're always laughin'.
Hey, what is this-an interview? We're supposed to be making love.
Oh.
There's a spider in the bathroom.
There's a big black spider in the bathroom.
My God, I mean, you know how I am about insects.
I can't sleep with a live thing crawling around in the bathroom.
No.
Hey, can yuh watch the road? Watch the --
How can you say that? I mean,  who said I-I-I-I said that you, I and that girl from your acting class should sleep together in a threesome.
Yeah, I know it's sick, but it's new. You know, you didn't say it couldn't be sick.
I'm cool.
Right. Tsch, well, I have to-I have t-o go now, Duane, because I-I'm due back on the planet earth.
I can't.
My head is throbbing.
I have a headache.
Oswald and ghosts.
This is, uh, Shawn, and, uh... Bob and Petronia.
You'll total the whole car.
Oh, no, no, that's bullshit, Max. He goes with that girl over there.
She was stealing.
SO?
She was going through my pocketbook!
Who's persecuting? She stole!
You think so? Do you really?
I was a great beauty.
I was very charming.
Oh, I was quite a lively dancer.
No, what?
Oh, she's really enjoying it.  I think. Is Mac okay?
Who, Sally?
I still think she sails above the rest. I mean not like her early films.  But those were all such great directors.
What?
Leo?
Leo?  It was out to Jude Law.  Jude passed.
October-ish.
Leo.  Leo's twenty-eight, Cal.
Scratch the two, write in a four.
Five years ago, I was at the party, remember?
My God, your wardrobe is incredible.  It took me forever to decide.  Oh, and I found Dr. X, thank you.  You saved my life.
What a nose.  You missed your calling.
Sally?
You have to sign your taxes anyway.
Fantastic.  Out here.
Hardly...
I think you're the most beautiful woman in the world.
And Joe's huge in Europe.  He's like a rock star in London.  His novels sell millions.
Oh for fuck's sake.  Nobody uses that gate.
It's a Calder.
He's my favorite.
Ah...
What?  Oh yeah, the camera man?  They gave me a list.
Not particularly.  Weird, isn't it?  God I'm rally up.  Do you feel anything yet, Mac?
Thanks, Mac.  And thanks for being so supportive about all this.  I really love you, you know.
God, I really need to jump about a bit.  How's your film going?
Oh?  It's easy.  You just put one foot in front of the other... That's a good girl.
Here, drink this.  Drink lots of water.  Hold on to this.  Take deep breaths. Nice and slow.  Would you like a lolly?
You're never too old for a lolly.  I'm having one.
No, it's not... Fuck fuck fuck fuck.
Sally?
It's a machine gun.  I thought I'd kill myself.
Suicidal.  It's much less codependent.
Not enough.
Panes is not on my team anymore.  I'll have Panes if I like.
Evie has a little something for you.
I'm new...I was born yesterday.
Nobody told me digging was so much fun!  You pick up the dirt, you move it, you pick it up again, you move it again -- lots of repetitions, you exercise the forceps, and the pincers --
I work in the palace, I don't get out much.
<u>What</u>?
How should <u>I know</u>?
Alright, alright, I'll try to get directions from one of the locals.
Hlllllllp!
I know it's crazy, but -- I can't just leave.  Don't argue with me.  If I've learned anything, it's that the problems of two people don't add up to a hill of ants in this world.  Or beans.  Something like that.  Anyway, I've <u>got to warn the others</u>.
Our platoon has the best assignment of all.  We're the first into battle!
Well, uh, who notices workers, sir?
I tell you son, sometimes, at night, I see myself in battle, fighting a horrible, faceless enemy, with the future of our whole species at stake. And always, the dream ends with each of us plunging his sword into the other's heart...
Why are we so successful?
You're a real buddy.
What do I do?
Well, I have some paper towels --
Yes, Mrs. Dreyfuss. He starts out with a worried backward glance toward the two. Fran is just sitting there, the spoon in her hand, not touching the soup.
Good night.
No -- I like it.
Of course not.
Much better.
This is a bad day for me.
I'd better get back to my elevator. I don't want to be fired.
Why?
No -- I don't want anything.
Three. The last one was manager of a finance company, back home in Pittsburgh -- they found a little shortage in his accounts, but he asked me to wait for him -- he'll be out in 1965.
So I came to New York and moved in with my sister and her husband -- he drives a cab. They sent me to secretarial school, and I applied for a job with Consolidated - but I flunked the typing test --
Oh. I can type up a storm, but I can't spell. So they gave me a pair of white gloves and stuck me in an elevator -- that's how I met Jeff --  Oh, God, I'm so fouled up. What am I going to do now?
Was he really upset when you told him?
Maybe he does love me -- only he doesn't have the nerve to tell his wife.
You really think so?
Can I have that pad and the pencil?
I'm going to write a letter to Mrs. Sheldrake.
As one woman to another -- I'm sure she'll understand --
You did?
Over a girl?
No, I don't.
Where?
In the knee?
That's terrible.
Are you just making that up to make me feel better?
I'm fine.
I'm fine all over.
Of course not.
I don't know.
Fine. And I want you to know I'll work very hard to justify your confidence in me -- SHELDRAKE Sure you will.  Say, Baxter, about the apartment - now that you got a raise, don't you think we can afford a second key?
You know my secretary -- Miss Olsen --
No, you don't understand. She's a busybody -- always poking her nose into things -- and with that key passing back and forth -- why take chances?
No I didn't.
That's right, Mr. Sheldrake. I won't be needing it -- because I'm all washed up around here.
Instead of Friday -- could you possibly switch to Thursday? You'd be doing me a great favor --
It's not Picasso I'm calling about. It's the key -- to my apartment -- you were supposed to leave it under the mat.
Oh, I found a key there, all right -- only it's the wrong key.
And I couldn't get into my apartment -- so at four a. m. I had to wake up the landlady and give her a whole song and dance about going out to mail a letter and the door slamming shut.
Thank you, Mr. Dobisch.
Get that stuff out of her stomach -- if it isn't too late. You better put some coffee on -- and pray.
Sure, Doc.
Well, I have things to do --
Yeah -- I'm giving up the apartment.
Nothing.  Just clear out, will you?
This is my brother-in-law, Karl Matuschka.
I promise.
Sssssh.
Wait -- wait -- don't get up tight -- what I meant was we'd need a whole drum for that --
No -- I worked too far north for LRRP.
Probably is.
That we're dumber than we look.
Mangoes? There as a fucking tiger in the woods -- I could've been eaten alive. I'm never going into that jungle again. I gotta remember never get out of the boat; never get outta the boat.
All right I got a little surprise for you --
Thta's not Charlie's work --
If you're B.L. Willard, 4th Recon Group, we'd like you to come with us.
He was the tragedy -- the tragedy of this war.
A man of war is never bothered to aid an ally -- you will follow me, Captain.
What, sir?
Big Duke Six to Baker Delta Four -- hold -- we're right over you.
The kid can't ride sloppy waves.
Because of all the things we do, the thing we do best -- is lie.
Oh Captain, that is so true.
Yeah, Jesus Christ !
Where's Kurtz? I want to talk to him.
Why did they attack us?
You're Australian?
So Kurtz is alive.
Whe you reach the boat you will find that half your fifty calibre stores -- a case of grenades, a mortar and two M-16's and a case of clips are being transfered to us by your order.
Needs patching.
139  CONTINUED:
157  CONTINUED:
Back against the bars.  Now.
Be careful -- there're two of them.
Wait a second.
Okay by me.  You're the one likes these hot springs so much.
Hunting and trapping was a damn fine life.  Me and Mitchell, Bob and LeMalle, we were teams.  I'd always go with Mitchell.  Good man, Mitchell.  I'd let Bob worry about goddamn LeMalle.  We'd hire a plane in October.  On the way to a dirt airstrip somewhere, we'd drop supplies.  We'd land, tell the pilot to come back for us a few days before Christmas.
Forget it.  It would take days.
An appetite.  Maybe you won't die after all.
Shut up!
I got it from here.  Thanks.
What are you talking about?
There'll be three, four men at the most.  I have some backup, nothing will happen.
I just as soon he stay gone. Fool could've got us all killed, arresting Ben Corbett here in town.
I'm right fuckin' here with you.
Huh?
Stay out of this...  Doctor?
Okay.
How ya doing?
Well, part of what I said in this entire history of my life which you won't read is that somehow you've done more for my mother, my son and me, than anyone else ever has... And that makes you the most important, surprising, generous person I've ever met and that you be in our daily prayers forever.
I also wrote one part... I wrote I'm sorry... I was talking about I was sorry when I got mad at you when you came over and you told my son that he ought to answer back so I wrote that.  I was sorry for busting you on that... and I'm sorry for busting in on you that night... when I said I was never... I was sorry and I'm sorry every time your food was cold and that you had to wait two seconds for a coffee filler...
Go ahead, Simon. Your father walked in on you and was yelling and... really, come on.
Don't be pessimistic. It's not your style. Okay... Here I goes... Clearly a mistake.  I have this -- what? Ailment... And my doctor -- a shrink... who I used to see all the time... he says 50 or 60 percent of the time a pill can really help. I hate pills. Very dangerous things, pills. "Hate," I am using the word "hate" about pills. My compliment is that when you came to my house that time and told me how you'd never -- well, you were there, you know... The next morning I started taking these pills.
I'll take a bus.
I don't care what you did for me. I don't think I want to know you anymore -- all you do is make me feel badly about myself.  You have my number.
I'm sorry... I can't hear you. I can't turn my head all the way yet... tell her we can't hear her.
Don't want to. I love you.
Hope you find him. I love that dog.
If there's some mental health foundation that raises money to help people like you be sure to let me know.
No! Would there be any way for you to be willing to walk his dog for him?
Not just today -- Uh, could you do it -- until, until he gets back on his feet?
You're a wonderful man. Two o'clock is a good time. Here's the key in case he's asleep. Open the curtains for him, so he sees God's beautiful work and knows that even things like this happen for the best.
Could you take it just a little easy, Mr. Udall?
Let's do the small talk in the car. Load up.
What are you talking about?
Yes...  well, there's one more stage -- trying to figure out if it's any good.
What's your name?  We both know it's not Nicholai.
I knew the same way in ten years you're going to know.
It means that I'm going to tell you things, even though I already know that you're not going to listen to a God damned thing I say.
Sure.
Freelancer.  A woman.  Surveillance specialist.
What?  How did you know I had a cat?
Who the fuck are you?  Who do you work for?
Yeah?
Right.
It's simple.  You need me.  I need you.  And we will both need money.
If it hadn't been for me, you would be dead.
Why?
Where you wanted to be?
How did you get into the business?
The C.I.A.?
How old were you?
Jesus -- why?
You were like a boy genius?
Why not?
You went from high school to the Agency?
They didn't give you a choice, did they?
But you knew what they were training you for?
Ahhhh...
The exotic women.
Why not?
Why?
Why did you leave the Agency?
They tried to kill you?
Then you went freelance?
Tell me about the first time.
Yes.
Because I want to know.
Are they usually like that?
After that?
Did it ever bother you?
That's fiction.
Does that mean it didn't bother you?
You can have the bed.  The chair is fine for me.
Okay.  Then what?
Aiiee.  More waiting?  I don't know if I like this plan.
I'm sure you will.
How can a beautiful man like you be shy?
Anytime.
I'm sorry, but I am waiting for an associate.  Can you hold everything for me until he arrives?
Thank you.
And not even then sometimes.
You've got to stop using that word "we" it's getting kind of scary. Right Katka?
Don't worry, I'll give you a hand as soon as I can.
Don't we have enough already?
And suppose a little old lady lives there?
Sounds like a good reason to leave it alone.
When your ready Son!
I can't, I've got to split. I have to take a class at two o'clock.
So?
Lucky break!
Did you see anything in the files?
What happened to those disks I gave you, have you still got them?
Suppose those contained all the file info too? You could have a third or so of it there.
No point, it'll be in Czech and God knows what format. But if I'm right, they could be my ticket out of here.
Siberia.
Get me one of the disks. Ask a Czech girl to smuggle it in to me this evening. Put the others in a locker and write the details in a note to Reuters and be ready to send it, if this doesn't work. You'd better keep clear of your apartment too. Do you know someone with a phone?
Good, what's his number?
No!
Sure I'm sure!
Hmm, I see possibilities but you got a lot to do.
Really?
I'll take a rain-check for now.
What? You are crazy!
No way Doug, I can't.
But I love you!
Great....How long will it go for?
Cool....So, if we say eight o'clock.
Well she sure isn't normal.
I had it coming from someone.
It was the biggest I could find.
A kind of freedom.
I insist, it is the least we can do.
Later.
We're not sure...
I'll tell her you were here.
I could take after Dad, too.
I meant he's a doctor.
I could do it if I tried. Even Kelly thinks so.
I'm just wondering --
What kind of a man are you, son?
Why?
And you have to meet my father.
In ten words or less?
My relationship with God is my own.
Don't you?
Thank you. So were you.
Why are you doing all this? To impress me?
Where?
Before the divorce. My father used to take me here. Fire spotting was his summer job.
Sure.
I will.
Better. I was really angry.
Dad --
No.
Like what, sir?
Yes.
Where did you get -- ?
I didn't say you did.
I was practicing. I've got an audition next week -- I gotta practice. How am I gonna get famous if I don't practice?
Nine o' clock.  Oh, I'm late! Maybe I'll see you later.
No!
It was Marty's turn to be confused. Huh?
Unfortunately, the way things are going, you may get your wish. You may see the entire annhiliation of the world. If not, you'll certainly see the destruction of all out natural resources. We can already see the air we breathe, not to mention the pollution in our rivers and lakes. We'll  see all of our oil reserves depleted, in fact, all of our energy sources. Yes, you people have a lot to look forward to -- a lot to see.
Yeah,  Right.
Why?
A mall?
Okay, Professor, I get where you're coming from. The way I look, the way I'm dressed...  I'd stick out like a sore thumb.
Nobody said anything about hitting her! You're just going to take a few liberties with her.
Look, Marty, she's not your mother yet. And if you don't go through with this, she may never be. I know it's hard, but there are some things we must do in life that are unpleasant. Some choices must be made that are difficult. Nonetheless, we must make them. Besides, this may be more than a simple question of your own existence, he added. The fate of the entire space-time continuum may rest on your shoulders . Marty tried to smile at him.
It'll be fine, Marty.  You'll be fine. Good luck. He stuck his hand out and Marty shook it. But there was still a question that was nagging at him...
But I told everyone your disappearance was due to a teleportation experiment you were helping me with. So don't mention anything about time travel to anyone.
The Orpheum.
Okay.
Kind of round, like so... Gold. I'll show you if you want.
What'd you come out here for?
Nah, I got me a job.
Well, I don't mind getting up early, so I got a job throwing garbage... I'm not in love with the stuff, okay.
I don't care.
He was nervous.
Anybody ever done that to you before?
Positive?
Guess there's no way I'll ever know. For sure.
Well. I'm not going to let that stop me.
Just thinking.
Wanta sue me?
Which we all know are the forces that tend to pull objects part, right, professor?
I think I'm on to something. You and the guys go back to the house and dig up everything you can on an outfit called Yoyodyne.
Yeah, but most of 'em blasted in through the Eighth Dimension in 1938 at Grover's Mills, New Jersey...
Boy, I hope so, Buckaroo Banzai.
This is so embarrassing...
Penny.  I'd rather not reveal my last name or my age.
Any time.
A what?
You're quite serious about this, aren't you, Buckaroo.  We know each other pretty well, I think.
Doesn't look anything like her to me.
Hell they don't. I met my first wife that way.
He will be... When he can't write, he drinks.
Audrey, thank you for coming. Thank you.  I'm sorry to be such a... such a... Thank you.
Stop it, Bill!
I...
Are you all right?
To do what?
I'm not sure anymore. I guess I try to make a difference.
To see pap.
I don't know, Garland; my place is here right now. I feel I'm on the brink of success-
Doesn't surprise me at all.
Thanks, I'll keep it in mind.
No, I'm actually writing for the pictures now 
No, I guess you're stuck with the one you've got. Have a seat.
Well, that's all that wrestling is. Except usually there's more grunting and squirming before the pin. Well, it's your first time. And you're out of your weight class.
Well...
What do you mean?
Well, I guess you pick your poison.
Don't pick up and leave without saying goodbye.
Everything's okay, believe me. I know it's rough mentally, but everything's taken care of.
...Both maybe?
You didn't let ME down. Or even Lou. We don't live or die by what you scribble, Fink. You let Ben Geisler down. He liked you. Trusted you. And that's why he's gone. Fired.  That guy had a heart as big as the outdoors, and you fucked him. He tried to convince me to fire you too, but that would be too easy. No, you're under contract and you're gonna stay that way.  Anything you write will be the property of Capitol Pictures. And Capitol Pictures will not produce anything you write. Not until you grow up a little. You ain't no writer, Fink  you're a goddamn write-off.
That's right, Fink, he lives next door to you.
I dunno, Duke. I kinda liked it.
Mr. Lipnik, please 
Thanks.
Who?
She said what you said she'd say.
Yes you did.  I'm a big girl.  I can handle it.
I got a message on my machine to meet Gus here.  Where is he?
A detective.  He falls for the wrong woman.
It's got to be tiring to beat that machine.
She wiped out her whole family.
Didn't you study it in school?
What's it about?
Fine.  How's your back?
Try me.
I decided to give you one more chance.  I missed you.
Did you miss me?
Come over here and tell me no.
I'd have to be pretty stupid to write a book about a killing and then kill him the way I described in my book. I'd be announcing myself as the killer.  I'm not stupid.
Nope.  There was some talk; it never panned.
The usual -- a girlfriend.
Nope. She did.  Like I say.  It never panned.
I hope I helped you out.
I got tired of being played with.
In that little pissant car of yours? Hell, no.  I ain't gettin' no back pain disability retirement -- I'm gettin' me a full pension and a real gold-plate Seiko watch.
You think I'd let you drive my Cadillac car?  I ain't lettin' no hear-up-his-ass person drive my Cadillac car.
Sometimes I think he started banging her just to get himself off the hook with Internal Affairs.
Yeah.  I know.
We bring her in for questioning.
On what basis?
No. Should I have?
Really. Huh. Too bad.
That's good. At least they're interested.
Wow... Stop giving them away.  I got an invitation to model for Comme de Garcons... You wanna do it with me?
Gee. I don't need to. You're a natural. You should sign up with my modeling agent.
Annina Nosei.
Oh man, you a FINE nigga! You know that?
I'm here.
Still not here.
Yeah..
About what?
Oh  you mean black people!
Hey fuck you! I deserve this shit. You're just jealous 'cause it ain't happening to you!
What who's saying?
What's that about?
Thanks
Yes, Boss.  If you're so smart, why are you here with me in this basement?
So what?
What time is it?
You're selling and ending the culture. Not one bit of information. Only to get the money and growl with the power, man.
I'm -- sorry, I --
Maybe you're right.
Somewhat like the lonesome secretary syndrome, I'd suppose.
Had one.  Didn't work.
Nope, I told her everything.
Well ... How can I put this. There were two truths ... and she had trouble reconciling them. Because <u>I</u> had trouble reconciling them.  Vicki said.
Photojournalist.
Good time, too.  Everyone but the bandits seem to be slacking off till after New Years'.
I have but one pet cause, today: Ban The Bat.
The Christmas Eve of Destruction -- !
Silent night, violent night...
We need signatures.  To overturn the ballot.  I can supply those, Oswald.
Oswald:  We need one more thing.
That's fine, Oswald.  But to get the Mayor recalled, we still need a catalyst, a trigger, an incident. Like the Reichstag fire, the Gulf of Tonkin.
I must protect my interests, Ms. Kyle.  And Interest Number One, is <u>moi</u>.
What is it?
Alfred, I know you're sick -- I can get you the best doctors.
Oxbridge Academy?
I recognized the accent.
Crimefighter's rule number one: never say that.
Mr. Freeze.
The new antiquities exhibit.  The Second Sun of the Sudan.
No, Robin.  He's going to jail.
What are you talking about?
A poison kiss?  You have some real issues with women, you know that?  You just couldn't stand that she was about to kiss me.  Couldn't stand that something might be mine and not yours.  Could you?!
Can I get some help over here?
You left your back wide open.  Freeze could have killed you.
You are looking unseasonably hot. Let's go inside and grab your rocks.
I find that unlikely.
To be frozen.  To never change.  A life of perpetual ice-olation. There is little perfection in that.
You're skating on thin ice.  My passion thaws for my bride alone.
Hop away little bunny.  Before I cool your jets.  Permanently.
I think they're getting worse.
Why, indeed?
Dr. Meridian...
Just checking, young sir.
Excellent. See. Who says a guy in a rubber suit can't be smart? Well, it's been grand. Sorry you all have to die now.
Just ones this beautiful.
On occasion. Usually at night.
And now....
Excuse me.
Let me ask you something, Bruce. What is man's greatest tool?
A man with a death wish.
Let's see if you bleed green.
Miss.
... Murderer...
... Where are you taking me?
You're just back from Corto Maltese.  I saw your combat photos.  Quite a departure for you.
I'll take you home if you'd like.
Maybe we should just kiss.
I feel naked without it.
They'll be sorry. They'll be sorry. MOVE OUT!
Very good idea, Jack.  In fact --  -- I'd like you to handle this operation personally.
Unfortunate, but I think we can work around it.
Well, I'm starving.  Will you at least buy me a hamburger?
Yeah?  According to this, he's in Geneva from '76 to '79. Well, I called Geneva.  Nobody there's even heard of the guy - - Probably off in Tibet with some kung fu master.
Everybody needs a hobby.  You explain it, Vicki.  He walks out on his own party.  Half an hour later, who turns up?  Batman.  Sees an execution, freaks out in an alleyway.  No place to change.
... Oh?  Why is that, Vicki?
Ahm - he's male.  He's English.  He's a doctor of er ... at least 2 things.  I think they would have mentioned if he was a blind dwarf.  Or one of those guys who kills lots of people all the time.  I think we're looking at someone moderately normal here.
Yes.  Yes.  Sometime.
It's okay.  There's no one out here. Just open the door.  Trust me.
I'm afraid you don't know the half of it. Sit down.  I have a tale to tell.  And not a happy one.
oh dear.
Ahm.... .
I don't think you really understand what you're looking at ...
I thought perhaps as Vice-President, and in view of the unfortunate attendance's for the summer show this year... the MASSIVE financial LOSS ...
I'm fired?  Because I let a... copy of a painting the get stolen?
Not my place, sir.  It would only be a matter of time before I'm calling you Dave.  Then where would we be?  By next year, you're my Sweety-Pie" and I'm "Coochie-Coo".  I'11 be back in 15.
Why thank you sir.
Yes it is ... may I introduce you To Bern ...
Yeah, heh heh. He's a anus. Heh heh.
Yeah, heh heh. I thought there'd be casinos and lights and stuff.
Huh huh huh.
That sucks. Heh heh. They need some shows about fire! Change the channel.
Uh...
Heh heh. We wanna do her now!
Just make sure it looks like an accident...
Huh huh. You guys are funny. Let's have a drink on it.
...o-o-o-eieee-ooooeeeooooo...
Chief, I swear, we tore that bus apart. They couldn't have...
Uh, yeah. Does she have big hooters?
This is gonna be cool! Huh huh huh.
Uh, do you think these two sluts still live in Highland? That would be cool.
I know... I just wish she'd leave us alone.
I can't clean anything.  The vacuum is out in the garage.  I can't leave the house.  Why don't they tell us something?  Where are all the other dead people in the world?  Why is it just you and me?
In heaven there wouldn't be dust on the wallpaper.
Dishes?  We haven't eaten in three weeks!  Adam, I'm not like you, I really need to be around <u>people</u>, get out to the church and go grocery shopping.
Nothing.  The bio buster?  I don't get it...
Where are your skulls and bones?
I am not going to expose that little girl to that... pervert down there.
I don't care, I've changed my mind.  ... I feel <u>really</u> confident.  We're getting better at this stuff.  We can scare them off ourselves -- tonight!  I've got an idea.  You're going to love it... I'm going to hate it.
We're ghosts.
I got an A!
No.  What's wrong?
I'm so sorry we frightened you. What were you doing?
I always tell the truth.  Of course I can see you.
Of course they're dead.  They're ghosts.
Where'd they go?
Are you a spirit too?
I want to get in.
I think so.
Well, it can't be any worse than my life here.
Yeah.
I... I don't know what your name is.
Yes.
He's a cloven-hooved beast!
I am ashamed to say he is.  Look, nothing short of giving away free sacks of money would get him up here, Charles.  And Sarah?  Forget it.  You can't get her out of Bergdorf's with plastic explosives.
Stepmother.  She's out torturing the movers.
I can't <u>bring</u> the ghosts.  They're not here!
I saw some ghosts.
Of course, her favorite color! How <u>beautiful</u>!
I don't know.
I'll need something personal of theirs.
Yes, Robert. But it's not bad.
In a minute, Robert - in a minute... Chauncey, I would like to ask a favor of you...
No sir, I don't believe I do.
Yes, sir.
Well, I still don't believe I know the man, Mr. Gardiner. Now, hold still.
Yes. I lost my remote control.
Yes.
He was a very wealthy man, he looked after me since I was young.
... Mentor...?
Yes, Eve. I'm very glad that you didn't open.
Yes. That could be true.
I have nothing more to say.
We must speak again, Mr. Gardiner, many times!
Reluctant to speak, eh, Chauncey? Well, I can understand that. When a man loses everything, anger has a tendency to block out reason for a time. Just give it some thought, work with the idea, I'm sure you'll have plenty to say in a few days.
... Oh?  Robert, take a look, would you?
Hello, Ronald.
I can't write.
I can't read.
Yes. I like to watch.
What sort of bed is it?
Good day, Sally.
... Yes sir - elevator!
Yes. We need a very good gardener.
Are you related to the deceased, Mr. Chance?
... You will honor me and my family with a visit, won't you?
Wonderful, we'll all look forward to seeing you.  Is Eve around? I'd like to say hello.
Sophie, this is Chauncey Gardiner...
Chauncey, this is Mrs. Sophia Rowley.
Apparently the White House shares our curiosity - they have also launched an investigation, and, according to our sources, neither the F.B.I. nor the C.I.A. has met with success.
Clearly, yes comrade.
Very good, Your Excellency.
It's that serious, huh?
Tell your friends.
I'm scared.
Yes.
We love her, Craig. I'm sorry.
Me and John.
Well, you have the Maxine action figure to play with.
Simulates?
Let me try.
Let me try!
Dr. Lester, it's been really fascinating, but I'm afraid I have to get home to my wife now.
Yessir.
That's sounds fine, sir. Gotta run.
Dont let the girly shit fool you. It'd blow your shorts off.
My God.
Ha ha ha!
Gehginnis ondah foam?
Fork ah did?
You bastard!
I have to see you.
Do you mind?
It's okay, my sweet.
There was a boy there...said mama was a jailbird...said he could prove it..
Beloved..She's mine       I am Beloved
No. Not a bit all right. Hasn't gotten out of bed since that day.
I don't know. I think I've lost my mother, Paul D.
DO YOU FORGIVE ME?
You know she married Baby Suggs' boy.
Aw, no, Ella.
You was friends.
Ella.
What's any of that got to do with Paul D.?
I run him off.
I told him...Showed him the newspaper. About Sethe. Read it to him. He left that very day.
He didn't know nothing. And nobody. Except her, from when they was at that place Baby Suggs was at.
Sure he knew her. Her boy Halle, too.
Don't talk to me, Mr. Sawyer. Don't say nothing to me this morning.
I'm telling you don't say nothing to me.
Yeah sure, if I'm ever in the neighborhood, need to use the john.
Crazy, huh?  Ran away a year ago.
That is for the urn.
Yes, so we were informed.  However, we must of course transmit the remains to you in a receptacle.
Yes sir.  It is our most modestly priced receptacle.
I got eighteen dollars, Dude.
I'm shomer shabbas.
They won't hurt us, Donny.  These men are cowards.
Well I like your style too, man. Got a whole cowboy thing goin'.
Irish m--What the fuck are you talking about?  My name's Da Fino!  I'm a private snoop!  Like you, man!
Is he pretending to be the abductor?
Look, Jeffrey, you don't really kidnap someone that you're acquainted with.  You can't get away with it if the hostage knows who you are.
So Dieter has the money?
Do you still have that doctor's number?
What?
Hey Walter--
It's all a goddamn fake.  Like Lenin said, look for the person who will benefit.  And you will, uh, you know, you'll, uh, you know what I'm trying to say--
Well call them up and explain it to 'em, Walter!  Your plan is so fucking simple, I'm sure they'd fucking understand it!  That's the beauty of it Walter!
I'm throwing the money, Walter! We're not fucking around!
Fuck that!  I love you, Walter, but sooner or later you're gonna have to face the fact that you're a goddamn moron.
Who's got a fucking million fucking dollars parked in the trunk of our car out here?
And what do they got, Dude?  My dirty undies.  My fucking whites--Say, where is  the car?
Look, man, did you--
Just ask him if he--ask him about the car, man!
Hey, cool it Walter.
Dude, I'm sorry--
You told Brandt on the phone, he told me.  So where do I fit in?
I'll say it again, all right?  You told Brandt.  He told me.  I know what happened. Yes?  Yes?
Did I urinate on your rug?
Hello!  Do you speak English?  Parla usted Inglese?  I'll say it again. Did I urinate on your rug?
Hello!  Hello!  So every time--I just want to understand this, sir-- every time a rug is micturated upon in this fair city, I have to compensate the--
You're just looking for a handout like every other--are you employed, Mr. Lebowski?
Are you employed, sir?
You don't go out and make a living dressed like that in the middle of a weekday.
But I do work, so if you don't mind--
My wife is not the issue here. I hope that my wife will someday learn to live on her allowance, which is ample, but if she doesn't, sir, that will be her problem, not mine, just as your rug is your problem, just as every bum's lot in life is his own responsibility regardless of whom he chooses to blame.  I didn't blame anyone for the loss of my legs, some chinaman in Korea took them from me but I went out and achieved anyway. I can't solve your problems, sir, only you can.
Well, you have your story, I have mine.  I say I entrusted the money to you, and you stole it.
Am I wrong!?
Then they weren't created to go after your "patient zero".
Like cancer with a purpose.
I don't understand.
I'll show you.
Thought you were dead.
He was here.  Watching us.
He wants us to know he's hunting us now.
Are you insane?  He'll kill us both!
Tweaked the phosphor rod, modified the collimated beam, wanna concentrate the light, get something like a UV laser going.
Yeah, but you didn't have the Scudster working on it, did you?
So how long have you known Blade, anyway?
Blade doesn't talk about the old days much.
China Town. I need more serum.  What's all this?
It's because I'm human that I can do this.
Do it. You'll be dead before you can file the complaint.
How can you tell?
We've got a good arrangement, that's all. Whistler makes the weapons, I use them, the vampires die -- end of story.
For them. But for me --
No problem.
The other elders will never let you get away with this!
So that's it? You guys just patch me up and send me on my way?
Their own blood can't sustain hemoglobin.
Closer. Lift the lid and look-- it hurts.
Down or off--you're giving me a migraine.
So whoever built this--
What?
--scared the living shit out of us.
Whatever you want.
--no, what's wrong with you?
Sometimes.
Can you zoom it or something, make it real close, real big?
Who do you know who can? Where do we go?
Why does everyone here but me have have a gigantic stick up their ass?
--Cotter: shut up.
Fucking owl!
No idea--goddamitt!
For "James?"
Fine.
I dunno it's safe to even get out of the car.
I think it's time to get out of here.
Rusty Parr had the right idea on child care.
Motion. Stop there. Play it again.
Sure. I'm sorry.
Get some more beer.
Go to the store. When you get back, I'll try to make sense of it for you.
We're not dealing with fucking logic here!
Yes! I need to speak to Sheriff Von Teer.
--it's urgent!
His daughter, for God's sake-- I need to know if he's heard from her this morning.
Meurice--
Yeah? What happened?
...I don't know if you can fire a psychiatrist, exactly.
...What do you mean?
Isn't that what you want?
I reckon I can hear him...  ...Room rate's eight sixty-six a day plus sales tax, plus extra for the TV option.
You owe me for two weeks.
I didn't say that. All I said was you're an idiot. Hell, you been thinking about it so much it's driving you simple.
Nah, I trust ya.
You shouldn't have taken the money...
Hey, I brought some friends. and some beer.
Yes?
Shut up. It's daddy. shithead.
. my bourbon.
Jeffrey.
Jeffrey nothing.
I wanted to see you.
Nobody.
I was. an experiment. Just to see if I could do it.
I sprayed your apartment. I took your key. I really didn't mean to do anything but see you.
. I saw you come in, talk on the phone. get undressed.
You said hello. to Frank. You wanted to talk to someone?. Don?. and little Donny. You said something about Momma loves you. and something about a Meadow Lane. something in an hour. I don't remember any more.
No. please. I won't.
There you go again. stop saying that. You can make it.
Take it easy. What's goin' on anyway?. Why are you in so much trouble?
Kiss me.
They hurt his head.
Don. help him. HELP HIM!! DONNY!!!!
Right here Frank. You want me to pour it?
There ya go.
There are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience. sometimes, in some cases. it's necessary to take a risk. I got to thinking. I'll bet a person could learn a lot by getting into that woman's apartment. you know. sneak in and hide and observe.
Settle down. I have a plan which I think will work. There is very little for you to do, but I do need your help. .Aren't you curious about my plan?
Alright. the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that I could crawl into later.
Right out in the car I happen to have some old overalls and a bug spraying rig. I will go to her apartment and be the pest control man. I will spray her apartment. After a few minutes you will knock on her door, drawing her attention away from me and I will then jimmy a window.
You will be a Jehovah's Witness. I have a few "Awake" magazines for you. You don't have to keep her very long. a few seconds is all I'll need. Whatiya think?
Let's just try the first part. If that goes well, we'll see about the rest. No one will suspect us, because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this.
I'll drink to that.
You better not, Jeffrey.
Goodnight.
I can't dance fast.
Really. you want to dance with someone else?
Let's wait for some slow one.
uh uh.
uh uh.
Looks like you'd make a good runner.
I mean, you don't exactly have the build for a football. I mean. no offense.
I'll get a coat for her.
What?
You'll see for yourself.
Man.  Fuck you guys.  I have this great idea and you guys have to be all skeptical.
We want some grass.
No.
We're not cops.  We're from Massachusettes.  I mean, does he look like a cop?
Yeah.  She told me.
I heard.
It's in the past.  I'm out of the business now, so forget about it.  No hard feelings.  We need to move on.  And besides, I'm sorry, too.
For calling you a homo.
Four passenger, single engine Cessna.
I don't know.  A hundred, hundred and fifty.  How many miles is it from Colombia to Miami?
We'll refuel in the Bahamas.  I know someone there.
I think it's fair to say you underestimated the market there, Derek.
But to the victor belong the spoils.
Everything is not alright.  I bring you in, and you slap my fucking face!
Okay, Mom.  It's okay.  Where's Dad?
Yes.  I do not know, either.  What do you want, George?
Yes.  Money.  Which is what, George?
Power?
Family.
Beautiful girls?
Keep them coming?  Ah, yes.  Ha ha.  You are right.  But money.
And Diego?
Dad.
Yeah, Dad.  I'm happy right now.
No thanks, fellas.  You've got the wrong fucking guy.  I'm not a rat.
Hello.
I don't think so.
Why are you smiling?
I know who you are, El Americano. Mister George.
You knew I was seeing Kristina, right?
Yeah, so I've been thinking.  I love her, y'know?  I kind of want to have her.  I've been away for so long.  Make up for the missed time, you know?
Yeah, well.  I'm working on that.  I've got something going.
Yeah, you will.  Of course.
I'll be here.
Very nice.  I'll take it.
All of it.  As much as you've got.  A couples thousand pounds.  I'll be back in a week with a plane.
I don't need a little.  I need a lot.
What if I brought you, let's say, fifty thousand dollars?  Would that eliminate some of your concerns?
Are we good?  Yeah, we're good.  We're beautiful.  We're perfect.  This is A grade, one-hundred percent pure Colombian cocaine, Ladies and Gentlemen. Disco shit.  Pure as the driven snow. Good riddance.
The successes obtained are the results of those methods. One presupposes the other and vice versa.
Not enough.
No, they'll do even more. We've given them the opportunity to do a lot more ... Do you understand what I mean? Starting tomorrow, they won't be groping in the dark any more; every shop and every worker who strikes will be a known enemy, a self-confessed criminal ... And they will be able to pass to the offensive. Have you thought of this?
Of course I am.
No. Let's just say that you've given me the satisfaction to have guessed correctly. But from the technical point of view, it isn't possible to speak of advantages. By now the game is over. The NLF has been defeated.
So, what good is it to us if it's been erased?
Why?
How?
No -- never.
Objection.  Your Honor, we don't know where this tape is from.  Who made it -- or under what circumstances it was made.
You get his statement?
We were lovers.
For about one year.
Intense.
It was wild.  She was constantly trying to get me more and more worked up -- kinky things.  I tried to satisfy her the best I could, but it was difficult in my condition.
I had a bad heart.
She said that she was working on a novel and she wanted to know what kinds of drugs would be harmful to someone with a bad heart.
No.
No.
No.
No.  No, I don't.
While I was seeing Dr. Paley I mentioned to him one night that someone was stealing drugs from the third floor dispensary.   Three days after I spoke to him in his office he went to the Head Nurse and told her he had witnessed me stealing drugs.
There was an inquiry.  It was his word against mine.  They believed him.  I was fired.
It must have been horrible.  Having to go there -- seeing them together - - knowing he was sleeping with her in the same bed he did with you.
Why'd you come here?
You didn't know about it before that?
Andrew hardly needed leading.  He was a very passionate man.  He was eager to explore.  I gave him what he wanted.  We fulfilled each others needs.
I think the photographer's probably a voyeur.
Oh -- Well, they're different.
It's not my taste.
I went out on the boat.
I knew you were thinking that.  I could see it in your eyes today in the courtroom.  You're wrong, Frank. I need you to believe that.
I do need you.  No matter what you think of me -- I didn't do it.
She's waiting in the conference room.
How often do you use cocaine?
Yeah -- fine.  Excuse me.  I'll be right back.
Sorry.
Well, there's a lot of boring stuff to do. Lists of people we have to write to. Find mama's relatives addresses in Italy -- stuff like that.
I said NO!
Well, I don't care if it's legal or not, we're not cremating her and throwing her all over some bridge where we can't even go visit her because she's going to be blown all over the place like an ashtray.
Have you called Betty?  Maybe you should.
Yeah. But I thought she died.
You mean -- she didn't like sex?
Boy. All these years I've resented not living the wild life in some place like Paris and all the time I could've moved back to Iowa... Are you drunk?
I think I better. Between the book and the coffee, I'm this close to raping the busboy.
Oh, honey. I'm so sorry. But you've got to be grateful for even feeling the little you've be given. Believe me. Go to him. Don't let him leave without these new precious hours you've got left. And if you need anyone to cry on, you know where I am.
I don't mind waiting.
I'm so sorry about that. It was rude. I think I just got nervous for some reason.
Well, let's just call it a compliment and move on.  Did you love teaching?
What made you ask such a question?
I thought we were just having a conversation. You seem to be reading all this meaning into it. Meanings I must be too simple to, uh... interpret or something.
What?
How about Italy?
How about Bari?
Have you ever been to that station?
You know that little place nearby with the striped awning that sells sandwiches and little pizzas...
Yes, thanks.
What?
Kinda pretty. Is this uh... jazz kinda singing?
Sure.
What happened?
Well, close the fucking door by all means.  But don't expect me to go down there and do it.
Maurice, man, shut the fuck up.
Spooked?
That's some terrible shit.
But that's your old hood, Pops.
No.  Not...not you.  You I forgive.
I didn't want a piece of yours, I wanted my own.
Mother!  No.
Bill!  Bill?!
Okay, okay.  Listen:
I thought you'd be psyched.  Just trying to do what you did.  Take nothing and make something out of it.
You'll take care of it?  Not this time. No way.  I bought it fair and square. And we open tonight.
I ain't killed nobody.  Shall I rack 'em?  Play a game, Lupe?
Yeah, you heard of him?
Not that I remember.
I was born near here.  My dad's from here.  He never mentioned it.
Save him?  What are you talking about?
I'll have whatever Violet's drinking.
Gino, your son stole this money to set me up and I can prove it.  Violet!
What?  Oh, come on, I didn't use one of the good towels.
Jesus Christ, Violet!  Open your fucking eyes!  Johnnie hates me like I hate him!
Caesar, what are you going to do?
What?
Caesar, you just killed Gino Marzzone.
What happened to them?
Ha!  What a load of crap.  Look at yourself, Caesar.  You're a thug. |You launder money for the mob.  You rent women like you rented this apartment.
It's all right, sir.
Why?
Sure, Cease.  They make us do stupid things, don't they.
All right.
Thanks.
If I say yes, will you take your hand away?
...  yes.
Even though he knew about you?
He was in love with you, right?
Yeah.
He hung it up.
To let it dry.
Poor boy, has to work so hard.
Thank you.
Every job like this has moments where things don't go so well and everyone starts thinking about their own ass. It's in those moments that everything comes together or falls apart.
Jesus Christ, Pop.  You got two hours until your plane leaves.
I'm assuming we're exploring that possibility.
Pursuit would indicate that you know exactly where he is.
Yes, well, I think we need some fresh eyes on this problem.  I'm bringing in some people from upstairs.
What did I do?  I spent thirty million dollars on you.  I spent three years finding you -- four years training you --  What did I do?  What in the name of God have you been doing, Jason?
They're right about you, aren't they?  You're fried.  You really don't know what's going on, do you?
Of course.  We had to try.  We didn't know what was wrong.  We didn't know you were in trouble.
So it's time to go home.
We'll make you better.  We can put the pieces back.  We can do that.
We have to go home, Jason.
<u>There never was a Jason Bourne</u>.  You have to come with me.  It's the only way.  We can give it back to you...
Jason...  They can't let you go...
Really.
Did you?
I know that.
I don't remember any of this.
Who paid the bill?
xxxxxx
What?
Maybe it's a game.  Maybe he's trying to send us a message.
All of them?
Thank you.
You're putting your talents to very odd use Mr Lowry - yes, odd use - to pit wits against Central Services -
I understand this concern on behalf of the tax-payers. People want value for money and a cost-effective service.
No, no ... I did that...
Look after that suit, eh. Barbara chose it for me.
Barbara's a perfectly good name, isn't it?
Why?
{baffled) I don't follow you.
Kindness? What's the purpose behind this line of enquiry?
Get her out of circulation - I've put her on the detention list.
Well, I ... Good point. What do you suggest?
What does that mean? I don't want to be involved in anything unsavoury.
Of course. We went to school together. You're my oldest friend.
You're the only person I can trust.
Right! Just between as and the Security Forces.
But, I've already put her on the search and detain list.
There's no procedure for that until she's been arrested.
We don't make mistakes.
Er ... alright. For Christ's sake don't lose it. Here, you'd better sign for it.
It's you ... it's you ...
What parcel?
Are you sure?
Well, that's it! I may as well go and hang myself! This sort of thing couldn't have happened before the stupid seventh tier reorganization! That was Simmons doing! And he and Jeffries always sit together at lunch! The bastards!  Ow!  Perhaps we can lose it ... behind the filing cabinet ... or destroy it ... burn it ... eat it ...
You haven't switched it on.
This isn't rare!
There was a slight complication. Dr. Chapman says it often happens with a delicate skin like mine. Nothing to worry about. He's promised me I'll have these bandages off in a ...
I know, I know ...!
I'm afraid I can't, sir. You have to go through the proper channels.
I'm glad to see the Ministry's continuing its tradition of recruiting the brightest and best, sir.
What is it?
My friends call me Harry. Information Retrieval, eh? Interesting!
Time to go.
He flipped out.
You're going to live.
I was tired. I needed a coffee.
Dead.
No.
Strawberry ain't shit. Drug pussy.  Me.  I swing like Reggie. Mr. October. Number three, game six, World Series.
Yes.
Yes.
Our Lady of Misery.
No.
He's working a double shift.
Maybe I should come up with you.
Nothing's going to happen. I'll come with you.
He's dead unless you folks want to stop bullshitting me and tell it straight. Then, Lord willing, we'll try to bring him back.
Please, a little decorum if you will. What I was going to say is, is that holding that baby in my arms, I felt like I was twenty-one again. A call like that makes me think of going back to three nights a week, not two, start running again, cut down on the drinking.
Here's to the greatest job in the world.
Yes.
Well, he's the steakhead of the night, then.
How's he doing?
What?
Used to be my partner.
Nice, Jane.
What's wrong with it?
No.  I don't know how much fun it will be when Martin Klein and Ernie have to drop off their credentials with the security guard.
No.  It makes me nervous to think about it.  Let's do this.
Right and we have the '81 pilot on the way in -- Nobody else will have him.
Call him -- I mean it can wait, right?
No!!!!!
I just want to sit here longer, I mean the feeling is powerful -- why's that?
Stop it.
Uh-uh.  I'm a little freaked right now about seeing my father though.
I'll be right down.  It's right tight.
He said something about...
Yes.  You didn't have to come here. It's just that I'm going to anchor this special report on this Libyan thing...
Yes, stop!  I wondered if you could find out anything about what's happening.  What's wrong?
Oh.
No.  I'm doing fine...Look.
Oh my.  I see you studying so hard, Tom.  What do you think the problem is?
No, I really got this job on a fluke and wait till you hear where it ends up.
How's it going?
I just got back -- I don't know which end is up.
Yeah?
Okay.
Good.  That's it...See you.
No.  That sounds more important. Let's forget about tonight.
I've got my father coming through tomorrow anyway.  I should get some sleep.
I'll see you at the office.  Good night.
Yes, I am.  Thanks.  I mean it.
I'm not knocking it.  It's a great solution.  Not only the storage but you can see everything you have.
What, right now?
Everyone wants to meet the bus boy.
He made a cat.
Now you're a professional!
Every word...
Walter, I'm sorry...
Do you have to be so cold to him?
I admit it.
I saw a statue once called The Third Time Phyllis Saw Me She Exploded.
I don't know it was made out of driftwood and dipped in sulfuric acid.  It was out there...
I didn't buy it I made it.
OK...good night Mr. De Santis!
Yeah, why?
Yeah and what would I say?
Hi.  I know you!  I've seen you down at the Jabberjaw plenty.
Uh, sure.
Walter shut up and relax!
Hiya Maxwell.
Hello Walter.  I want to tell you the super fixed the leaky pipes and sealed up that hole in your wall.
Walter you look awful pale! What did you have to eat today?
If you were my son...why don't you let me fix you a nice hot bowl of soup, it won't take but a minute.
My arm!  He took my fucking arm!
Absolutely.  I see now the error of my mistake.
You didn't like them.
Would you sleep with them?
Well, there it is, isn't it?  You don't even like them, and you'd sleep with them.  What's that all about?
Oh, yeah, and then you'll never call me.
Guys.  The environment.  I'm telling you, it's totally key.  The earth is in terrible shape, we could al die, and besides, Sting's doing it.
You were having a nightmare.
Have you ever thrown up in the front row of a Richard Marx concert?
Yeah, I was bailing.  I have a friend, and he's really... well, he's really vampire, I guess.  Bad scene.
Thanks.  Tomorrow morning, I'm on a bus.  I'm gone.
Well, I've always wanted to see Oxnard.
Benny was right.  You guys are all exactly the same.
Bogutude.  Blow it off.
You're weird and I'm afraid of you. Seriously, Cassandra, there's a lot cooler things you could be doing than your homework.
Like my homework.
I forgot.
Look, a lot's been going on.  That's what I wanted to tell you guys about. I need to tell you.  You see... a while ago, I met this guy --
Lothos.
There's a great deal I have to show you, I'm not even sure where to start  There's so little time.
Do you know what a Vampire-King is?
Oh, yes.  And the man from your dreams.  Lothos.
Yes.  They travel about, usually with one or two of their followers to lay the groundwork.  The vampires find a community and they feed on it, make it their own.  You were difficult to trace, and I think the process has gone a lot further than I'd anticipated.  Usually this goads a community into some kind of paranoid frenzy.  But for some reason, nobody here seems to be paying any attention.
We'll cover it later.
In a way, yes.  Your fate is inexorably connected to them.
We're going to have the work hard. You'll need some excuse for staying out.  For your parents.
Fine.
Does the world 'Duhh' mean anything to you?
He knows who I am!
Yeah, just make sure you do first. Let's go, guys.
You know you must.  There is only one.  Now you are that one.  It is time.
She has died.  You are the next to be called.  Why do you think you were sent to me?  Trained as you were?  You bear the mark.
Where'd you learn how to do that?
Wit-tay.
Pike isn't a name.  It's a fish.
Oh, please!  When she ran onto the field in the middle of the game? Was that the most out-of-it thing ever, or did I blink?
You can learn to like it.
Y'know if you make it to the Bigs you could still become the host of Dance Fever.  Baseball's a good stepping stone for things like that.
There is a lot of things you never thought of, sweetie--now get some rest for tonight's game.
Oh don't be silly.  Death is nothing to be scared of.  It's just another way of living.  It's just a fresh start--kinda like spring training.
it's okay..
He's a virgin.
What'you see in that guy--he's dim, pretty boy.  a young, wild,
That's my job too.
I was raised in a Baptist church got dipped in the water when I was 5-- born again before kindergarten...by the time I was 10 I knew it was bullshit and at 15 I ran away from home...
What's it say?
You need a nickname.
You missed him!
I ain't pissing nothing away--I got a Porsche already.  A 944 with A.C. and a quadraphonic Blaupunkt.
You been in the Majors?
Yep.  He really crushed that dinger, didn't he.  Musta gone 450 feet...damn...
C ' mon!
God damn it, you fucking virgin prick--step outside.
'Cause of Ebby Calvin LaLoosh.  The Big Club's got a hundred grand in him-
Have you accepted Jesus Christ as your personal savior?
Can I give you my testimony?
...and one helluva guy.
What?
What are you talking about?
On behalf of the Teamsters' Pension Fund, it is my pleasure to present to you . . .
...this check for $62,700,000 for the new Tangiers.
Wait, hold on a second.
Hold on a second.
Yeah, sure I do. Why?
Well...
Where the hell did you learn how to deal? 
Place the checks properly. That's the way you do it.
What do you think about me movin' out here?  What's the matter? You got a problem with that?
You mean, I have your permission?
I don't care. I want to get away from back home for a while. I'm tired of that shit back there.  Look at this place. It's made of money. You know what the best part is? Nobody's gonna know what we're doin'! There's nobody here to see us! Everybody's back home.
Don't worry about it. I'm not gonna do anything. What am I gonna do? I'm especially not gonna involve you in anything.
...and he tells me to go fuck myself.
Then he called me a faggot.
What? Ho-  Hey, come here.
Listen...
What people?
I don't even know what you're talkin' about, Nick.
I didn't do anything. I mean, I didn't order you or anybody...  I only told Andy Stone that you had a lot of heat on you, and that was a problem.
Yeah, I said I - let the bullshit blow over for a while so I can run the casino. Anything goes wrong with the casino, it's my ass. It's not yours, it's my ass.
I -
What are you -
I'm only on TV because I gotta be able to hang around the casino. You understand that. You know that. Come on.
Yeah, I did want to go on TV. That way I have a forum. I can fight back. I'm known. People see me. They know they can't fuck around with me like they could if I was an unknown. That's right.
Me?! I wouldn't even be in this situation if it wasn't for you. You brought down so much fuckin' heat on me. I mean, every time I meet somebody here, the big question is do I know you.
No, it - it - Nicky, when you asked me if you could come out here, what did I tell you? I mean, you asked me, and I knew you were going to come out no matter what I said, but what did I tell you? Do you remember what I told...
...you? Do you remember what I told you?
You never - ?
No, that's quite all right.
Hello, Jennifer, it's Sam -
L'chaim. [Yiddish for 'to life']
Thanks a lot.
She could be the most charming woman you ever saw. People loved to be around her.
...on the stuff involving crimes. So on...
Yeah, and I get a sprained fuckin' elbow.
Let go of me! Let go of me!
Who were you with?
I know you were with somebody. Who was it?  I just hope it's not someone who I think it might be.  I just hope it's not them.
Oh, you are...
Let me in the house! Fucker!
What are they doin' way back there? Bring 'em up here where they belong. You can't even see 'em over there.
What about the progressives with the high jackpots? Where are they? These machines are hidden.
These are our best machines. They bring all the action. No wonder the drop is off.
The action is in the front, not in the back. Bring 'em up front.
Listen to me very carefully. There are three ways of doing things around here. The right way, the wrong way, and the way I do it. You understand?
Don't thank me, just do it. You're the Slots Manager. I shouldn't have to tell you this.
And don't forget to tell your friends what happens if they fuck around in here. You understand?
You're fuckin' right, you made a bad mistake. 'Cause if you come back here - we catch either one of you - we're gonna break your fuckin' heads and you won't walk out of here. You see that fuckin' saw?  We're gonna use it. You don't fuck around in this place. You got it?
Get out of here.
Hi. Good.
Well, I've been busy. 
Listen... Nicky... we talked about this... and, uh, I explained to you that there was the possibility you might have to take some kind of loss.
What're you gonna do? Strong-arm me?
You can't talk to me like...
Sam?
Hey!
Ace got my son, little Nicky, involved with Little League, and it was great.
Turned out to be one of the other coaches was a fuckin'...
...metro intelligence cop. But it didn't matter. I mean, it was all about the kids, you know.
Yeah, well, that's exactly what I keep tellin' him, but that's the kind of kid he is ever since he's born.
He tries to do everything...
Carmine left?
That's enough now!
Oh, come on.
You're so nice. 
Is that what you want?
A sponsor.
Mm... okay. Don't worry about it. Nobody'll fuck with ya anymore. I'll take care of ya.
Yes, I will. It's what you want, isn't it? Huh?
It's what you want?
Ginger, honey.
It means I got the money.
Boy, look at this place, huh?
All right.
She asleep?
Fuckin' Jews stick together, don't they?
So are we.
No more! You see? Watch!
...behind my head. They trust that scumbag, I don't. Right now, the way I feel, I'll hit the two of them in the head with a fuckin' shovel.
Mom, I'm sorry, they're beatin' me left and right.  Ma, I'm sorry. I'm all upset.
You know - You know - You know what they're doin' to me?
I can't take this no more. Back and forth, back and forth.
All right, all right. But I - I -
You know, I - I'm too upset right now. And - An end has to be put to this.
Ayy!  Some cat's blocking the periscope.  Somebody, give it a swat...
Nothing, just a jolt of deja-vu. I think I went out with a guy with a dignified British butler--can't remember how it turned out..
You're probably right.
I still can't get over it. I still can't believe you're Catwoman..
But it's true!  You can call him yourself.
You might be right, but Fun is overrated.  I need something real.
Why am I still troubled...
Oh, I like her. I like her a lot. I want to save this one for later. Something that tasty you don't eat all at once. Go back to your alter- egos, we'll regroup in the morning.
Spear.
Stop.
Can I be frank, Frank?  Your entire existence is sexual harassment. I accept there's not much you can do about it.
Go together?  Sure, why not?  Another date with someone who could be an insane messenger of death for all I know. No offense. Hey, lean over, let me smell your breath..Say in a deep voice, "A superhero's job is to protect..."
Oh, so now even the keepers of the city don't meet your standards...You're late.
Where do you think you're going?
This is one way.
I don't see anybody in there but you.
I'm not finished.  Under other circumstances I'd gladly go out of my way.  I don't understand why you just don't phone some other person.
Theo wants to talk again.
Yes sir.
Put those away.  We can't have marks on his wrists.
I'll see that he stays calm.  Pack the money up and put it in the trunk.
What am I supposed to do?
I hear them coming upstairs.  I won't be able to talk for awhile. I have to lay the phone down and pretend to be asleep.  So don't talk.  Don't say a word or they'll hear it.
Sometimes I paint.
Pictures.
They say my work is somewhat derivative.
What do you mean?
She'll be with you soon.  They're pulling up.  They'll realize I kept my part of the bargain.
Include me in that.
Inform him the fee is seventy-five large for your return.  All parts intact.
Plus names, addresses and I.D. for the lot of you.  We're in this together and I need to know who my partners are.  In case I ever need to roll over on somebody.
Let me talk to him.  Hold the phone to my ear -- but don't nudge me.
That's not good enough.
Who is this?
Are you trying to panic the women?
I'm tying it up in a bundle now. Where is she?
I just strolled out of the emergency room while they were admitting Rodriego.
Only you <u>don't</u> have a flat.
If you weren't going for a spare what were you doing?
Mind if I have a look?
Is that good or bad?
Hi, Jimmy.
Charming.
What?
Who's she?
Where?
Must be in love to manage that.
Want to look after you.
Something I heard someone say once.
What you doing here?
Don't call me that.
Give it over, Dil --
Stop it, Jimmy.
Yes.
You could say that.
I can't.
For me.
I will be.
Let me go, Dil
And she used her tits and that cute little ass to get him, didn't she?
Tell me what she wore.
That's wise, Tommy.
Jesus, Fergus, you're a walking cliche. You know we won't leave her out of this. But I'm glad to see you care.
Request permission to take the hood off, Tommy.
The poor whore's suffocating in the heat.
And anyway, he's seen our faces.
He described me down to a T. Knows what Jude looks like.
Definitely unusual.
Just a girl.
Aye, I do, Peter.
No fucking way.
I'll bear that in mind.
Doesn't matter where.
Having a pint in the Rock.
Like what?
Me? No, I'm not good for much...
People. They could be looking.
Where are you, ol' buddy?
Relax -- you're gaining.
It's Thursday today -- and it's almost five -- come on!
And that's all the gratitude I get for saving your hide.
What a terrible thing to say. How could you even think that?
Because they're still here.
Like I said, Mrs Lampert -- I'm afraid you're in a great deal of danger. Remember what happened to Charles.
None whatsoever. Please, Mrs. Lampert -- be careful.
Okay -- up there.
Reggie?
No cat and mouse -- you've got me. What do you want to know?
I had to -- for all I knew you could have been in on the whole thing.
But you know my name -- it's Dyle.
Yes, he is. He was my brother.
The army thinks he was killed in action by the Germans, but I think they did it -- Tex, Gideon and Scobie -- and your husband -- because he wouldn't go along with their scheme to steal the gold. I think he threatened to turn them in and they killed him. I'm trying to prove it. They think I'm working with them. But I'm not, and that's the truth. I'm on your side, Reggie -- please believe that.
That sounds like their problem.
Let me know what you want -- I'll pick a suit that matches.
I was expecting you. You are American too, of course.
The man who bought them last week was American. I did not see him but I heard. I knew you would come.
What do you want?
Tell me what?
I don't know anything.
Leave me alone -- !
Stop it!
And this?
I don't blame him. Jean-Louis -- do you know where this Monsieur Flix lives?
Fun and games. Evidently we're the floorshow.
No, everyone. Come on -- avanti, avanti!
That's all.
I don't know.  Those men killed Charles to get it. But he must not have had it with him on the train.
But he didn't! I've looked everywhere --  And if I don't find it --  Those men going to kill me.
Please stop -- please!
The American Embassy.
I wonder why it's so important to know if they fucked?
Oh GOD Brent, is there anything you don't feel guilty about?
Focus on the present. You always want to change the past. Let's figure out what you are going to tell the parents today, not what you should told them yesterday.
You tell these people someone is out there killing virgins and we're going to have a goddamn fuckfest on our hands.
It can't be.
Never mind darling. You go back to school. I don't want you missing anymore classes today.
I'm looking for Lisa Sherman.
You know where I can find her?
She works at a church?
I knew you were a pervert. Always wearing those fucking doofy glasses, and driving a station wagon.
You eventually have to talk to him.
FINE. Are you?
What?
What party?
No.
My dad acts like he's Johnny Fucking Perfect and he's really Johnny Fucking Rapist.
I can't believe I listened to one word of his shit.
So I should feel happy that he got away with it?
Pretend we're just another couple.
Are you Jody?
Ok.
No.
I'm not leaving it here.
INT. ICE CREAM TRUCK/CAB - DAWN.
INT. TUNNEL - DAY.
Suppose you're gonna shoot me because you can't get service on my cell phone.
 No...
Hey, take a look at your situation and...
...-cho and a hijack-...
Hi--!  The gun was empty!
...you.
And I'm a peaceful man, and...
 Yeah...
...you stole the truck to uphold your principles, right?
 
...truck!
Well, then, that means it's call...
You  snatch that  phone  from me one more time, I'm--
What?
Oh, shit.
You all right?

 That's why I didn't give it...
What?
Sometimes the prey bites back.


...on!
 
Look out.
Why'd you stay behind?!


Don't be tedious, waiter.  Dr. Long called it Elvis.
I had no idea how powerful it was.
 ...-onds...with just a fraction of what's in...

You-You can't let him...
  Hey, actually...
Are you crazy?!  Take the boat?!
...happen if I drop this?
Well, Lieutenant Vitelli.
Pleasant surprise.
And I certainly can't say it's pleasant.
I checked your release date.  I never liked coincidences.
EXT. BRYNNER'S VAN - NIGHT.
INT. POSTAL VAN - DAY.
Just when we have all the cards, Vaughn.  Take these two behind the van.
Then meet me at the dam in fifteen minutes.
Be sure you feed Bosco.
...like April.  It gives him gas. And make sure there's  two pots of coffee...
...ready before the morning crowd blows in.
INT. TUNNEL - DAY.
...colonel?
Tryin' to remember somethin' somebody once told me about tyin' a fly.
...that the prey can bite back.
...hands!
INT. ICE CREAM TRUCK/CAB - DAY. 
INT. GOMEZ'S HELICOPTER - DAY.
I said horseshit.  Horseshit.
My daughter.
Just find the girl, Mr. Gittes. I think she is frightened and I happen to know Hollis was fond of her. I'd like to help her if I can.
Oh they don't?
Sue the shit out of 'em.
No?
You mean that's what you're going to call it.
Too late for what?
Do you know where she might be?
Looks like you went quite a distance.
I'll stop by.
Did you have affairs?
Did he know?
Oh.
The District Attorney gives his men advice like that?
Because of Hollis? Because she was seeing your husband? Was that it? Jesus Christ, say something. Was that it?
To Mexico...
Oh yes we have... are you alone, Mr. Gittes?
J.J. Gittes. And it's not a departmental matter.
What about the water?
When it comes? What'd you tell him?
I'm afraid not, Mrs. Mulwray. These men are my operatives and at some point they're going to assist me. I can't do everything myself.
Now, what makes you certain he is involved with someone?
Look, you tell me to take pictures, I take pictures.
Well, you never know, do you?
Why'd she run away?
We missed the best of it, didn't we, pal?
It tastes wonderful!
What you say is wonderful! But sad...
Yeah!...Getting there's downhill and all the saints help you. But coming back! The saints stand there watching you, that's all! God's will be done.
The army says that, as a war orphan, I don't have to serve in the military, but nothing can be done. It's a bureaucratic error. I have to leave. Day after tomorrow morning. They're sending me to Rome. But they'll discharge me ten days later. Let's go...
It takes years to get there. And years to come back...Now go to bed, Toto, it's late.
How are you, Mr. Thatcher?
Two cents.
We certainly do.  Vacation's over - starting right after dinner.  But right now - that lady over there -  - that's the new society editor, I take it?  You think I could interrupt her a moment, Mr. Bernstein?
Charlie?!
September the ninth?
There is no news big enough.
As a matter of fact, we sent a man to the Silverstone home yesterday afternoon.  Our man even arrived before the "Chronicle" reporter.  And there's no proof that the woman was murdered - or even that she's dead.
It's not our function to report the gossip of housewives.  If we were interested in that kind of thing, Mr. Kane, we could fill the paper twice over daily -
Really, Mr. Kane, I can't see the function of a respectable newspaper -
The story about him and Miss Alexander, Mrs. Kane.
But I'd arranged to go home with you myself.
It can wait.
I know exactly what I'm doing.  Get out!
On the chiffonier.  Here.
I've got a brush in the closet.  As soon as the mud on your trousers is all dry - you just brush it off.
- And left?  Of course they'll hear.  I'm not saying goodbye - except to you - but I never imagined that people wouldn't know.
Your mother won't be going right away, Charles -
Yes, sir. 
Our readers are, anyway, I don't know about the rest of the country.
But there is no Front, Charlie. There's a very doubtful civil war. Besides, I don't want the job.
No, that won't help.  Besides, you never get drunk.  I wanted to talk about you and Emily.
Mr. Leland sent back that check.
You made it out to him last week after he left for Chicago.
It was for twenty-five thousand dollars.
Was he in love?
Yes, sir.
But don't you think if we release it now - he's only been dead four days - it might be better than if -
What did you get?
It's a picture of a cancer-ridden lung. Keep it.
You're very protective of him, Randal. You always have been.
Awww. That was so cute.
It wasn't me.
Was it you?
Shock trauma. She's going to need years of therapy after this. My question is, How did she come to have sex with the dead man?
Sir! Sir, I'm sorry! He didn't mean it! He was trying to get me.
I know. I'm sorry. Let me refund your cigarette money, and we'll call it even.
Yeah.
You called Caitlin again?
Did you tell Veronica?
What do you two fight about?
I'll bet the most frequent topic of arguments is Caitlin Bree.
I'm going to offer you some advice, my friend: let the past be the past. Forget Caitlin Bree. You've been with Veronica for how long now?
Chick's nuts about you. How long did you date Caitlin?
Chick only made you nuts. She cheated on you how many times?
Eight and a half?
That's cheating?
She called you Brad?
That's not cheating. People say crazy shit during sex. One time, I called this girl "Mom."
What do you mean?
Oh, my God.
That girl was vile to you.
Your mother.
Chess team Allan Harris?!
That's frightening.
In light of this lurid tale, I don't see how you could even romanticize your relationship with Caitlin-she broke your heart and inadvertently drove men to deviant lifestyles.
Oh yeah.
You think things would be any different now?
Oh shit, I've got to place an order.
No, no, I'm listening. She's leaving college, and...?
What about Veronica?
Caitlin's on the same wave-length?
Then I think all four of you had better sit down and talk it over.
You, Veronica, Caitlin...  ...and Caitlin's fianc.
Who cares? That lady's an asshole. Everybody that comes in here is way too uptight. This job would be great if it wasn't for the fucking customers.
You gotta loosen up, my friend. You'd feel a hell of a lot better if you'd rip into the occasional customer.
Liar! Tell me there aren't customers that annoy the piss out of you on a daily basis.
How can you lie like that? Why don't you vent? Vent your frustration. Come on, who pisses you off?
Let's hear it.
The milkmaids?
One ball!! They come all the way here... I close the damn store... for one ball!
Randal, twelve minutes is not a game! Jesus, it's barely a warm-up!
Gatorade.
I don't want to talk to you.
Why should I loan you my car?
You want to rent a movie.
Could be.
You need a ride?
How much can you bench?
How do you figure... HEY! You can't roll a joint in here!
It's not my store.
The difference is you exploit a weakness.
You sell to people that can't stay away from an addiction.
A dollar sixty-nine, plus tax.
So.
I can't believe you just rolled a joint in here.
He died in the bathroom.
I don't know. I wasn't watching.
Knock it off. That used to be my girlfriend.
We were going to start again, I think.
Veronica.
Lasagne.
Maybe.
I jacked the car up. All she did was loosen the nuts and put the tire on.
She's my girlfriend.
Meaning?
You're a pig.
Do you know how many different men I've had sex with?
Three.
Three including you.
I'm not the pig you are.
You!
John Franson and Rob Stanslyk.
I am. And that's why you should feel like a pig. You men make me sick. You'll sleep with anything that says yes.
Vegetable meaning paraplegic.
After dropping a bombshell like that, you owe me. Big.
I want you to come with me on Monday.
To school. There's a seminar about getting back into a scholastic program after a lapse in enrollment.
It's important to me, Dante. You have so much potential that just goes to waste in this pit. I wish you'd go back to school.
I don't want Caitlin...
I don't want to go back with her...
Randal...?
Veronica, I love you...
He knows some English, but he can't not speak it good like we do.
My ex-boyfriend was about his height, but he was much bulkier. He could bench two-fifty, three hundred easy.
No way!
That's tight. Solid.
No, I wasn't.
I don't appreciate your ruse, ma'am.
Your ruse. Your cunning attempt to trick me.
I hope it feels good.
I hope it feels so good to be right. There is nothing more exhilarating than pointing out the shortcomings of others, is there?
What?
That woulda been cool.
So, what do you see?
What usually eats a banana?
So...what are you, blind, son? This is a banana eating a monkey, nature in reverse.
Hey, fuck you.
Hi, Gabe.
Patience my love, patience.
Wait, I think I have them sighted.  What's the word, Frank?
Can't do it.
Yeah?
Sure, just give it back when you're done.
Forget it.  If that charge goes off before we can reach it, this whole damn crevice will slam shut on us.  This way.
Gabe?  Wait 'til I get over there.  Tie the rope so I can come across.
No, he's gone.
Tucker and Walker.
Climb, Gabe, climb!
There, what's that place?
Hey, you dealt us this hand, we're playing it all the way. Move.
You bastards... bastards.
Bit of pain in the gulliver, Mum. Leave us be and I'll try to sleep it off... then I'll be as right as dodgers for this after.
I've got to rest, Mum... got to get fit, otherwise I'm liable to miss a lot more school.
Alright, Mum... have a nice day at the factory.
I did, sir.
The accidental killing of a person, sir.
Alexander de Large, sir.
Murder, sir.
You mean, I have to viddy two sessions in one day?
But it was horrible.
I just don't understand about feeling sick the way I did. I never used to feel sick before. I used to feel like the very opposite. I mean, doing it or watching it, I used to feel real horrorshow. I just don't understand why, how what.
Prison custody?
Something to sharpen us up, you especially. We have the start.
Park Avenue and East 2nd. Take Centre to Canal, up the Bowery, Cooper and Third, left on 41st, come around on Park.
Sure thing.
Oh, my, yes.
Fella owned this place back then, Dix Dwyer, he let slip to Louis that I played.  So Pops, he just waves me right up.  My heart about stopped. But I got up there all the same, and we played for nearly twenty minutes.
I think...  ...I think you should get this gun out of my fucking face.
I said.  Get the gun.  Out.  Of my fucking <u>face.</u> Before I wrap it in a blintz and feed it to you.
Take him down.  Save Richard Yip, our witness...
Max never had many friends.  So much with the piano.  Always keeping to himself, it's unhealthy...
...show me the wallet, man, get your ass up, <u>up</u>...
...everything is not about me, don't make me the villain here.  That asshole was out of line, and you goddamn well know it...
...oh, bullshit!  He was intruding on my space, he was demeaning me personally, he was patronizing...
...well, last I checked, you were <u>sleeping</u> with me, so unless you wanna start fucking the guy soon, I'd suggest an attitude shift...
No shit.  Since he has two .45s double- tapped through the sternum and fell six floors onto his head...
Yes!  I'm trying, I swear!
Two...
You don't know the guy in the trunk, either.  If it makes you feel better, he was a villain involved in a Continuing Criminal Enterprise.
Yeah, like that...  But, anyway, nobody gets out of this alive.  Even if we quit smoking and cut out red meat.  Everybody dies.
Yeah.
She's in the hospital.
What difference does it make?
There's no way I'm taking you to see my mother!
Makes two of us.
Guy came in with a gunshot wound, but he died of a heart attack.  Go figure.
Sorry, Flip.  Got sidetracked.
Put down the gun and I'll take your statement.  Okay?
That's how long it takes to turn a hospital inside out.  A lot of people are after you, Jerry.
Oswald was an assassin.  You're not an assassin, are you, Jerry?
Right.  Sit up so I can see you.
Them who?
Flesh wound.  No big deal.
Jerry, there's something I have to ask you.  Actually about a hundred things, but we can make progress, if you answer one question.  To my satisfaction.
It was that painting.  The one on the wall.
It made me feel like you could see inside of me.  And I don't know how that's possible.
How is it possible?
I would never hurt you, Liza. Think whatever you want, but don't think that.
I thought you -- Why -- Love ruins everything, doesn't it?
Did you kill him?
Did you kill my father?
Without a love of my own.
Yes you do, Jerry.  Quite well.
The truth shall make you free.
Only on the football field.
I don't understand.
What the hell does that mean?
You think we have time to fool around like this?  Come on.
Okay, fine, they've got the primes -- but if you're right about there being another more significant transmission still to come --
You must have checked the signal for polarization modulation already...
Maybe they are.  Maybe this is all part of the package.  The building of the machine has demanded international cooperation on an unprecedented scale.  Maybe requiring us to come together in this way was, in effect, part of the plan.
Maybe it'll be at the end of the data when the message recycles.
It can't be coming from Vega, the system's too young.
Because I can't.
The librarian... or the library...?
Japanese squid fleet.  They use lights to attract them to the surface... then turn them into sushi.
They can't.  I think it's against human nature to admit to that level of... insignificance; to not see yourself as basically the center of the universe.
'Any sufficiently advanced technology...'
Make that two.
I don't know.  But as a scientist I have to consider that possibility.
It's getting late...
I'm not sure it's come to that.
I do.
It also makes God enormous.  I think of the scope of your universe, Ellie... and it takes my breath away.  As it will everyone else's.
Ellie, you're the proof.  You tell them your story.  Ultimately they'll have no choice but to believe you.
Ellie, the only one holding you to that standard is you!  The people want to hear your story, they need to hear it!
Have you seen what's happening out there?  The terror, the despair? The world is on fire, Ellie.  People need something they can believe in, something worthy, and you can give it to them!
Ellie... if you go out there like this -- if you admit to even the possibility that what you experienced didn't actually happen -- I'm afraid they really will crucify you.  Please.  For your own sake, for the sake of the world... tell them what you know to be the truth.  Tell them it really happened.
We work down in the ditch?
She took off with that convertible feller...
Yeah.
That's good: he earned it.
Gotta go, Arletta.
I... I... I...
Yeah, they sure do make a lot of cold, hard, noise, Captain.
Drag's been chain-ganging so long he's got a nose like a bloodhound.
Mah baby! We're diggin' and dyin' but our boy Luke is lovin' and flyin'.
I thought you knew, boy... they sentenced me by the mile.
That's it. That's the end.
He's the champeen hog-gut of this camp. Hell, I seen him eat ten choc'lat bars and seven cold drinks in fifteen minutes. He kin eat busted bottles and rusty nails, any damn thing. If you'd so kindly oblige as to let me cut off your yankee head, he'd even eat that.
Bears gonna be walkin' the road today.
Well, how far didya get?
None of your fucking business.
Oh my God!  Help!  HE'S READING A NEWSPAPER!
Okay.  You win.  'Dirty Harry' coming up.
But </u>alive</u>!
Inspector Halloran.  Homicide. You were supposed to contact a Peter Kurten?
Cut the crap.  You got a sheet the length of my arm...
Shut up -- I'm talking.  You got felony breaking and entering, burglary, felonious...
It's Daryll Lee Cullum, isn't it?
You know I can't do that.
Well, let's thank God you and Inspector Goetz are on the case, then.
Oh, my God, no!  I'm a clinical hysteric, with panic syndrome, and anxiety neurosis, agoraphobic, I'm afraid of everything, real and imaginary.  I never leave this apartment now.  Nobody ever comes here.  I just wanted to get your attention.  I write and I used to lecture on these crimes, but... I'm not competent.
Inspector Halloran, that is so much bullshit, you don't like or admire me, but the beautiful part is I don't give a fuck.  That's the upside of having a breakdown.
Will you go.  Andy, make them go.
Nobody knows you have anything to do with this case; nothing has been on TV or the news... Why would he want to get in <u>your</u> computer?
One of those goddamned car alarms. What's going...
Look in the crowd.  He liked to hang around and watch the cops at work...
W-We had a fight.  I called him... called him a name...
That would be much appreciated. Thanks.
Why don't you shoot off the lock?
Because it's your job, that's all.
Maybe it's something you did in this life, Nikko...
It's mostly done, they got nobody in common, the three of them... No mutual friends -- the Landlady says nobody was ever there, she never saw her with anybody.
Look at him, grandstanding...
The same as the firs two. Definitely a serial.
What clues?  I'm going to work Helen Hudson.
So I'm maybe gonna lose three good cops?  You fucked up on this occasion, but don't be so hard on yourself.  There's something I want you to think about.  The book says if you use your gun, use it to kill, that's what it's meant to do. You tried to pick this punk off with fancy shooting, to keep him alive.  To what end?  You're not willing to kill, you can't be a cop.  Go get drunk.  I am.
In the private aircraft hangar. Anybody could have walked in.
No. What about your camera girl? Did she come?
It does.
He's very pale. Covered with scars.
No. But when he's in that car...
I think it's badly scarred too. From a motorcycle accident.
Not yet - though not soon enough for some people, I've already found. A death in the doctor's family makes the patients doubly uneasy.
I'll wear a bloody kimono if I want to.
I work in the immigration department there.
Hard to say.
No, thanks. I'll go with Vaughan.
Well, I don't have hallucinations. Honest.
Yeah, and a dimple.
OK, good. That's good. Thanks an awful lot for everything, and for coming down here to see me off.
I have a going-away gesture for you, too.
She said she'd be here at 10.
I'll be back before you can say souffle.
Come on.
You too, Mom.
I will, Dear. I promise.  Why McDonald's?
It's OK. It's not a pass-fail kind of thing.
I wasn't hungry.
Finally. I was getting tired of watching him try every night.
Paul.
Back-to-back sessions with the shrink.
Home free.
Do you like it?
Really?
Thanks.
Congratulations.
And all the plans we have.
It's not another one. It's my sister.  Aren't you happy for her?
You can get out of the dinner.
Come on, Letty.   It'll get done.
No, no.
Of course. Yes. I will.     I do.
So, in light of how the parents feel, and the fact the students are doing so well with the substitute, I don't think I can put you back in the classroom just yet.
I know, Letty. But the incident with Zach was frightening for the children.  Now if you'd come to me, explained what was going on...
I'm glad you're doing well.
Hey, you're not exactly the most trustworthy guy in the world. I took a shot. It didn't work. Did you bring the tapes?
Oui.
Supernumerary. It means better than expected.
I know they won't be home tonight.
I'm just setting my boundaries.
I'm trying.    It doesn't work.
Better than spending my life crawling through windows in the middle of the night.
You steal some money from a man he gets over it in time. But these tapes. He's never going to stop looking for us.
I promised Bonanno I'd destroy the tapes.
Send some flowers. Something nice. Roses or carnations. And one of those get well soon cards.
I can handle the exterior alarm, but the one in the bedroom is a problem.
She took everything!    Didn't even leave us cab fare.
Yeah, I can see that.
Me?
I've still got a few legal problems back in the States.
Get in the car.
Watch this.
Zero did not put it in his bag.    He put it in yours.
Just lucky I guess. How'd you start working for the Bastaldi's?
So you arranged to have the people you worked for robbed?
She doesn't know. She thinks I fell down the stairs.
Why should I?  You need practice. I can teach you to fight with the Green Destiny, but first you must learn to hold it in stillness.
I've always wanted a disciple worthy of Wudan's secrets.
That's a risk I'm willing to take. Deep down, you're good.  Even Jade Fox couldn't corrupt you.
I have a guest.
Look at the trouble you've caused. Now you know what Giang Hu life is really like.  If you think of me as your sister, let me give you some sisterly advice.  You can run from marriage, but not your parents.
Go back to them first.  Then you can decide about Lo.
He really loves you.  Come back to Peking with me.  We'll find a solution.
Li Mu Bai has made arrangements. He sent him to Wudan Mountain.
How dare you accuse us?  I always knew you had stolen the sword! I've done nothing but protect you and your family.  And you're repaid me with nothing but contempt.  Li Mu Bai himself spared you, and all you do is insult him.  We wanted some peace and you've ruined it all! You're no sister of mine!
Give it back!
"A faithful heart makes wishes come true."
All right.  I'll write you an introduction.  Take it to Wudan. Wait there for news from me.
We must avenge mother!
I call it blood, Detective.  If you want, you can call it graffiti.
You must listen carefully:  the Fire Department will be here soon. There is an injured man in the alley who needs assistance.  As Shelly Webster once needed your assistance, and as you are shortly going to need my assistance.
How 'bout the morgue?
Can you play "Teddy Bears' Picnic?"  It used to be her favorite.
No name.  You sure ask a lot of questions.
I don't know you.
I ain't got no fuckin' ring.
Interested?  Follow the crow.
18k.  Crap.
Nineteen bucks at Sears.  Fake,
Bad news.  Alot of action on the streets tonight, and nobody bothered to clear it with me.  Tin- Tin got himself whacked.
One of mine.  And it wasn't a standard hit.
I was wondering if you could tell me anything... about a wildcat operative.
Anybody violates my turf -- our turf -- I'll rip out there heart and show it to 'em.
On my mother's life.
I don't... I don't want to answer that... look we're friends.
Of Human Bondage.
Yeah, it's pretty relevant considering my situation.
Yes.
I'm just being honest. I just wanted to see what you were like in bed.
Well hurry up. I want to be at Mrs. Rosemond's before lunch.
Something awful happened last night.
I... I don't think you want to know.
It involves your brother. He... took advantage of me.
If she knew, she'd kill me. It happened at your house last night.
I don't know.
Well... not exactly.
No.
My mom? Don't call my mom.
I do.
Let me tell you something, doctor. Chicks love a guy with a bad rap. They say they don't, but they don't mean it. They all think that they're the ones that are going to "save me." The trick is to let them think it's true.
Same time next week?
Why? I like spending time with you. You know, you're quite attractive for a woman your age. You have killer legs. Killer.
Don't be insecure, Doc. You're a big help.
I told you to lock the door.
And this happened before you and I hooked up?
Racist piece of shit.
He doesn't scare me. I'll kick his ass in.
Don't worry about it. I'll stay.
Could you be more desperate to read it?
Have you succeeded in your task?
Well, let me know when you do. Until then.
Where is she?
Where'd she go?
I'd love to, but unfortunately I'm expecting some company.
Not that it's any of your business but yes.
I hope I didn't keep you from something.
It's Cecile.
Well... you promise you won't say anything to her. We've developed a friendship and...
It's worse. I think there's something going on between Cecile and her music teacher.
I know. She's so young and he's so -
Yes, you already did.
I'd love to.
I can make wishes like this come true.  I'll be just like Daddy wants me to be -- play with the other children -- not sit around by myself  tell the truth --
Wouldn't it be just the same, darling, if daddy dropped the present at Mrs. Farren's on his way to town tomorrow morning?
All right, Amy.  Go tell Edward to take you.
I thought Amy was calling. I guess not.
And you should.  Your mommy tells me you've been such a good girl, and your daddy is so pleased with you.
This one says, "To Mother from Amy."
You called me by my name.
I'm your friend.
I've wanted a friend too. I've been lonely.
You wouldn't understand. I come from great darkness and deep peace
I can not tell you.
For as long as you'll let me.
For always, then. Only you must promise never to tell anyone about me
No. This must be a friendship that only we shall have... you and I... Amy and her friend.
Don't cry, Amy.
But Mrs. Farren just started to tell me a story. Please.
Why hasn't he got a head?
My daughter died long ago.
Come away, Amy.
That's because she made a promise, and she'a keeping it, aren't you, darling.  You saw the way she played this afternoon, Edward.
Sorry, don't mean to be wolfing down. I'm just starving.
It's hard to describe. I get really bloated and irritable and emotional and depressed and...
What else is there?
It's not just in my head.
What do I need overpriced fancy underwear for? Shouldn't a guy have already decided that he likes me before he sees me in lingerie?
I don't know.
No, Mark wears boxers. They must have been in the dryer already.
I still thought it was a purse.
Frida? I was worried to death about you. I've called you for two days. Where have you been?
Tuesday. Are you okay?
Frida, Carlton's dead.
And he was missing an arm.
Relax. Carlton was torn apart. No way could you have done that. Maybe you saw someone kill him and blocked it out... or...
Does that mean this whole thing is over?
Let's do some research. I'll check the libraries. You surf the web.
So are you. Look, go about your life. Act like nothing's wrong. We'll get to the bottom of this.
Starving.
You haven't even paid me back the thousand bucks you owe me!
Uh... yes. Not for us. No woman in jeopardy. Find me Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman. Find me a true story about a crazed killer stalking beautiful women.
No?
Very well then. Is that all?
Briefs.
Me neither. That's why I wear briefs... So why did you and... Mark break up?
Frida, can we come in? We need to talk to you. It's important.
They're for my cat. I use them to train him not to rip up paper.
I loaned him to Jennifer. George moved out and she was lonely...
Maybe we should have children. I don't think I'd kill the father of my child.
Worse than this?
What about... those guys... I might have...
I'm so sorry... I... I couldn't help it. You know I didn't mean to... to do any of that.
No, take it.
It's so bad she becomes a werewolf.
Don't be stupid George. Obviously if she's a werewolf, she can't be around a cat. She might eat it and besides, cats are afraid of wolves.
I told you she was innocent.
She was never a suspect Lloyd. Some animal must have done this.
Hard to tell. Looks like he's been cleaned up and he's decomposing as we speak. This case gets weirder by the minute.
Okay Lloyd. First, no way does Frida have the physical strength to tear a guy to shreds. Second, why would she be so obvious and let it be known she was the last one to see these guys? Third, she's the one in danger. She's a woman in jeopardy and you're layin' a murder rap on her. Fourth, I look in her eyes and know she's no killer.
How will we interrogate them?
Yes.  This way.
I didnt requisition a secretary.
What?
Yes.
It must be a closet or something.
Yes.
No, it's the truth.
What?
No more than the usual.
It's in the little leaguer who may strike out but knows in his heart that at least swung...  Hands to the side...
I'm... not... nobody...
Well, maybe I am.  But you're fired.
Exactly. A condition.
Couple of days.  Anyhow, look at these tracking polls, they'll burn up in your hands: seventy- three percent with seniors, eighty- four with working mothers...
And look at this.  Russell came around on the trade bill.
How long have you been waiting to pass that thing?
I'm telling you, Bob,  it's a gift. When you got a Ferrari you don't leave it in the garage.
It's fine.
Why would they do that.  They hired me.
Oh, yeah... probably...
What?
Fertility beads.
We'd like to hire you.
Well...
I don't understand.
What's wrong with a magic trick?
I don't know.  I hadn't thought it out that far.
You mean when I'm not running the country?
I run a temp agency.
Yeah, well... It's finally over.
And if I don't? If I don't you'll come back after your death. You'll come back and find yourself hanging there...wanting to eat...needing to eat human flesh. You hate that thought, don't you? That's the ultimate sin for most of you fools, isn't it?
Quiet!
Farther than you think. You'll get lost. You will. And there's Bees all through the jungle. I ain't lyin' to ya. Religiosos don't lie.
We got a boat.
I say we got a boat. Can you get other stuff?
Shhhhh....Tony. Rest, rest.
I'll have somebody's ass for this. I'll have your ass, soldier. I'm not gonna stand here and...
Don't come.
So don't goddam come!  Please.
Well, no shit, Sherlock
Knox, you gotta calm down.
Wait a minute, Charlie. This should belong to the club.
Miss it?  It drives us crazy.  That's part of what this club is about.  In fact, I'd like to announce that I've published an article in the school paper, in the name of the Dead Poets society, demanding girls be admitted to Welton, so we can all stop beating off.
Yes... sir.
It's only me, Mr. Nolan.  I swear. I made it up.
They were walking along the fence past the soccer field.  Said they were curious about the school so I invited them to the meeting.
Stop what?
Knox!  what are you doing here?
Precisely, Meeks. Greek for the herd. However, be warned that, when you say "the hoi polloi" you are actually saying the the herd.  Indicating that you too are "hoi polloi."
Ah, so you boy's have been snooping.
Nothing wrong with research.
Yeah, you just do everything they say! You'll be in daddy's law firm as sure as I'm standing here.  And you'll be approving loans till you croak.
Good luck.
Todd Anderson.
What is that supposed to mean?
You want me out...  is that what you're saying?
Listen Neil, I appreciate your interest in me but I'm not like you.  When you say things, people pay attention.  People follow you.  I'm not like that.
No!  I don't know,  I'll probably never know.  The point is, there's nothing you can do about it so butt out, all right? I can take care of myself just fine.  All right?
No?  What do you mean 'no'?
He's the owner...
Which question is that?
Take note Mr. Mason...this is why you hire a professional...No whining. No excuses.
Did you clear this?
Nothing...you want to come, come... you don't...
Keep tasting...
You ain't giving the orders here!
Joey...
I have been.
How does an island sound to you?
Maybe plans changed...
Yeah.
I know...
Yeah, Sal--
Vince thinks... you know...
Well, where the hell is he!!! I mean what are we all sitting here for!!!  WHAT THE HELL IS THIS???
Thanks.
Oh. Fine.
No.
Inside, Vince.
Sure.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Right.
Huh?
Hunt with Vince?
There's Albert!  Hey, Albert!!!
Trip? What do you mean, Nick? You said you'd be --
Phantom Mary?
No.
Yeah!
I just... would like to say a few words... about Merle. I guess Merle always wanted something... I don't know... better. That fucking guy, he saved my Life. He saved Sal's... What Merle liked, he liked things right... But then there wasn't any place for that... that he could find.
Avon Lady!
Fill it out.  Standard issue mal- practice insurance.  All Cops carry it.
Remember my promise.
Got compliments coming outta your ass, don't ya?
But sir, Sergeant Wade saved the hostages.
I got it.  I got it.
Ah Mom, you're embarrass'n me.
Go in the house.
I'm not fond of television comedies.
Engaged.  Plan on doing it this summer.  You still married?
No thank you, sir.  Smoking causes lung cancer, heart disease, emphysema, and may complicate pregnancy.
No, sir.
He's got my grandson, Sanchez.
I'm signing off.
Hi.
They're just outsiders. They want to see how fine Jabez Stone lives these days. They're waiting for your guests, too --
It's mine, Ma! Pa made it for me -- and I'm not going to give it to anyone!
No! No! I won't.
Why not! There's a bill up in Congress to give us a uniform law of bankruptcy. Daniel Webster is fighting for it right now--
You are afraid!
-- of what happens after we die!
But what becomes of our souls?
Don't say that -- I know it is --
What if one hasn't a soul any more? What of that?
I do -- and I think you should too.
I'm through with you.
I have still a year -- a year to make up for everything.
Not now! Not now!  -- Let me make up -- let me make up.
Anything -- anything. -- You can have it all back -- that money -- the new house -- my farm -- the whole caboodle!
No! No! No! Not him -- not my son -- I'd rather go with you -- right now.
I -- I don't know what you're talking about! I -- I haven't time to listen to all this --
It's your fault! You brought Daniel Webster here -- just to try to make a fool of me! You played the sneak behind my back -- made up all sorts of lies against me! You can get yourself out of my home -- go back to the other house -- that old place, where you belong -- I don't want to -- to talk to you again!
Headache -- Squire?
Camomile tea!
Jabez, don't you remember your own wedding? We said it's for better or worse. We said it's for richer or poorer.
Looks right elegant, Mary.
Mary -- but look -- it didn't touch an ear of my corn -- we'll have a rich harvest.
Mary!
Well, thank the Lord you can always depend on New England for weather. We've got enough for the whole United States.
Lan's, I'd think you was having the baby, to hear you.
Hello, Jabez -- I was just talking to Stevens about a little extension on your payment.
Yes, Ma -- I'm ready --
She'll be here in a moment. She has a special surprise for you.
Argyle.  I'm your limo driver.  Hey, nice bag.
No, sir.
See to Heinrich...  Now...you can break the code key...?
Okay.
That was Gary Cooper, shithead...
Whoa, Hans, now you're the cowboy?
Gennero.  Miss Gennero.
Can I get you anything?  Food?  Cake? Watered down champagne punch?
Hey, we're flexible.  Pearl Harbor didn't work out, we got you with tape decks.
I'm here, cowboy.
Don't tell me, partner.  I'm just a desk jockey who was on the way home when you rang.
In my youth, partner.  In my youth.
Yessir.
You men shoot, aim for the white meat!
That's why I can talk to you, as an equal, Sonny.  You got to merge your whole soul with God.  And then you are Him and one with the Holy Ghost.
Sonny?  Don't send me away!  I can help you save your soul ...
When I'm bein' fucked, I like to be kissed a lot.  Who the fuck are you tryin' to con me into some deal?  You're a city cop, where's the FBI?  This is a federal offense, I got kidnapping, armed robbery, they're gonna bury me!  You know it, you can't talk for them, you're some flunky pig tryin' to bullshit me.  Now God damn it, get somebody in charge here to talk to me!
Calm down... look at this, look at him...!
If he moves - blow his guts out... Cover him!
You're goin' outside with me.  If there's no cops around, we just split.  Otherwise, you go with us.
I guess he didn't appreciate your use of language.  They don't speak that way on television.  It's a rule.  Do you realize you've cut off a valuable source of communication?
What now, Sonny?
Because I'm scared, that's why. You never smoked?
You stopped?  Why?
You don't want cancer?  You're about to get your head blown off, you're worried about cancer.  Gimme the cigarette.
Dead or alive?
He was talkin' about arrangements ... we were talkin' about the TV.
He was showin' me how the airport bus is comin' in, like that, Sal.  What's wrong with him?
What I said.  You just sit quiet and we'll handle Sal.
What's the matter... they never housebroke you?
What's wrong with that?  The FBI was very understanding when I explained it to him.  Everybody knows it isn't you ... It's the pressures from your home life.
Did I say a thing against her?  God forbid I should say anything against that fat cunt.
If she comes down here, so help me I'm gonna mash her brains in. Everything in your life was sunlight and roses until you met her.  Since then, forget it.
I know you wouldn't need Leon if Heidi was treating you right.  The thing I don't understand is why you come out and sleep with Heidi anyway?  You got two kids on welfare now.  What're you goin' to bed with her, you don't have enough with one wife and two kids on welfare, you want a wife and three kids on welfare?
What'll you do?  Come out.
Oh.  Run.
Maybe...
<i>Choco grew up on the streets of El Salvador. When he was four years old... he stabbed another kid in the eye-ball with a pencil.</i>  <i>There were wires crossed somewhere in his soul.</i>
You know what I'm talking about, did you fuck her?
That bitch called me a bitch.
Yes.
He sent us out to the Fender Compound. Out in the desert near the Chicken Ranch.
PROVE IT!
Wow. Laurence Harvey. He knew Frank Sinatra?  I knew Frank.
You're wearing eyeliner. You look like a queen.
They're gonna edit it together out of sequence so it's more exciting. <b> EXT. BEVERLY HILLS -- LATER ON
Nobody.
If I wasn't a righteous Black man you'd be in serious trouble. SERIOUS.
What?
Ask Sal.
I don't know how he does it.
How old are you?
What makes Sammy run?
What makes Sammy run?
Relax, Eddie, I want you to go to the corner store.  How much will it cost me?
Eddie, you're too smart for your own britches.  Listen to me.  How much do you want to run to the store for Da Mayor?
You got a deal.
I know, Mother Sister, but I'm here now.  Where's the stuff?
Don't worry about it.
I'll be back on my feet.  Soon enough.
Him no white.  Him no white.
I wants my money.  I wants to get paid.
Mookie, I told you already it's too fucking hot to make love.
I'm sorry, but no rawness is jumping off tonight.
Da Mayor ain't no bum.
Who don't work?  Let's see you carry six large pies up six flights of stairs.  No elevator either and shit.
We're outta here.
My friends laugh at me all the time, laugh right in my face, tell me go feed the Moulies.
Mister Radio Raheem, I can't even hear myself think.  You are disturbing me and you are disturbing my customers.
Don't start on me today.
Actually, my name is Cindy, the accent just helps me meet boys.
Are you kidding? I couldn't be more okay.
Are you kidding? I'll be down in a "I-crapped-my-pants."
Coming.
I know I am, Mom.
Maybe the treasure's a chest full of apples and bananas!
The principal.
What?
She did not.
LLOYD, she's my mom.
Will not.
Shut up!
You're not my real dad.
Shut Up! Buttlick!
I learned it from listening to you! I hate you!
That's why you have to drink it fast, trust me.
Sucks for you.
I don't know. I haven't decided yet.
You and me? Dream on, desperado.
I'm kidding! Of course I'll be your partner.
What are you staring at, you ugly monkey?
Yeah, that's why I asked.
I know I did.
I don't know who we are anymore.
PRINCIPAL COLLINS is a greater American than George Washington will ever be.
No Lloyd. Chicks are for fags - I'm not going to do it.
That's not your tape.
THAT'S NOT YOUR TAPE.
Come on, I live with the janitor. I have a key to every room in the school.
Principal's office? Yeah, I guess I can swing that.
Principal of jail. Wow. What a promotion.
It's too close to call.  Okay next contest, now lets...
Oh, yeah he was straight all right, just wasn't very good in the sack. I used to give him directions. Higher, lower, faster, harder, small circles, do the alphabet. Useless.
Yes, it's the big potato. Just have a look at this.
I don't know where it is. It's not here. It's been stolen.
No you don't know who stole it. Just let me do the thinking.
With your permission...
I hope I made myself clear. You may call him "The Duke," "My lord," or "Sire." And there is a more ancient term you might keep in mind -- "Noble Born."
The Emperor's blade.
Where are we do you think?
I am a servant of the His Majesty the Emperor. I have served His Majesty on Arrakis long enough for my eyes to change.
Long live the fighters!
SILENCE!
Yes.  There is nothing more comfortable.
No.
Well... I guess I should go.  Perhaps we could get together again?
BULLSHIT!  I am ready now!  Roll the camera!!
Ach!  How do they expect a Hungarian to pronounce this dialogue?  This live television is madness!
Nonsense!  You look great --  Look, uh, why don't you lie down and take a little nap?  We'll film around you for a while.
It'll be wonderful.  We'll be at peace.  In the afterlife, you don't have to worry about finding work.
Formaldehyde.
I just wish you coulda seen the movie.
This is the big moment...!
Yeah.  It seems a little crazy, but sometimes <u>you just know</u>.  She's perfect for me.
Of course it is.  And that's why you should play the part.
I told you this was gonna happen.
That's moronic.  Why would a bit player impress a backer?
That's a good reason to dump your girlfriend.
I don't know.  Hey Bill, which dress is better for you, the green or the red one?
Hruphh...?
Da pleasure be mine.
Nonsense!  You must try our hot glug.
Are you a fruit?
So you're not a fruit?
You gotta be kiddin' me.
Yeah??  Well Orson Welles didn't wear angora sweaters, did he??!
What do you mean?
Hell, if I did, I wouldn't have any friends.
What's uncanny?
Great!  Bring 'em in!  Bunny, I gotta run.
Don't worry, I'll teach you.
Who?
Yeah, so... ?
Well, I don't think you can get more common than me, Al.
Oh, see, studying would've been a huge help. Where were you, then?
Yeah. Because, you didn't talk me into anything. Everything you wanted me to do, I wanted to do.
Yeah, what - they put some schmuck on TV all day long or something?
Yes to me or yes to the coil?
Holy sh--
Everybody's making audition tapes for that Real TV thing.
No, I mean...
Look, not having been there... I just think you're hurt and you're saying this to, you know, get back at him.
I know, but even if they go away, everybody in America knows what we're doing because... they went away.
I know, I ...
I really like you too...
... yeah, then, but...
Ed... I think we should stop seeing each other.
It's what I do. I yell "Geronimo" and jump out of a relationship.
Screw off.
I don't know.
Hey. You know-- we're not the same. I got a good life, this job suits me. I come and go when I please --
You watching the ballgame?
Oh. All right. I'11 watch at home, then.
A hundred per cent cotton. Okay, here we go, Andy.
What?... Why?
What happened? You described this "crazy-kooky" family who'd be a million laughs on TV?
You know, Tracy... I don't know how to say this, but...
Dick.
Thanks, Mr. M.
Looks like Tim Kobza.
I'm looking at new cars.
My mother's buying me a new car for college.
Well, I got in everywhere I applied, but Cornell is my first choice.
You'll be fine.
You will.
Here?
Okay.  Give me the drill.
Why don't you guys go sit down, okay? I'll catch up in a minute? I want to talk to Mr. M. about some important stuff.
It's a conflict of interest.  And Paul was first.
Don't you fucking knock?
Paul, get out!
Are you sorry she's dead?
You gonna tell me what happened with you and Exley?
So tell me about it.
No.  Now.  You fucked him.
I got to write my report first.
Hell of a way to avoid a prison sentence.
He had help getting up there.  Two of his fingers are broken.
At least not anymore.
<u>Lynn</u>.
Against your code?
Do you care about criminal matters peripheral to Susan's murder?
Then you wouldn't feel obligated to report them?
Then listen closely, because I'll only say this once and if it gets repeated, I'll deny it.  I run call girls.  Lynn Bracken is one of them and so was Susan Lefferts. I treat my girls very well.  I have grown daughters, myself, and I don't like the thought of women being hurt.  I sense you share this feeling.
I think she'd been hit in the face with a tennis racket.  She is -- was -- a big doubles fan.
Wait.  Our deal still holds?
<u>Ear plugs</u>.
It doesn't exactly play like dumb panic.
It's like they knew they were going to kill everyone before they went in...
You ain't woofin' I did.  Stupid down home niggers got no more sense than a fuckin' dog.
Am I...?  Would you be willing to plant corroborative evidence on a suspect you knew was guilty in order to ensure an indictment?
Answer yes or no.
Would you be willing to rig crime scene evidence to support a prosecuting attorney's working hypothesis...?  Yes or no, Edmund.
Would you be willing to beat confessions out of suspects you knew to be guilty?
Would you be willing to shoot hardened criminals in the back to offset the chance --
Then for God's sake, don't be a detective.  Stick to assignments where you won't have to make those choices.  Patrol, Internal Affairs, but not the Bureau.
At least get rid of the glasses. I can't think of one Bureau man who wears them.
Tell that to Jack Vincennes.  To Stensland.
Why?
And now you'll provide them.
Give me a minute, will ya?
A guy dressed as Santa has been exposing himself to kids in Los Feliz.  Apparently, sir, he's decorated himself.
With tinsel and plastic icicles and... on his penis, sir.
Of his penis, sir?
I see Bud because I want to.  I see Bud because he can't hide the warmth he has inside him.
I see Bud because he makes me feel like Lynn Bracken and not some Veronica Lake look-alike who fucks for money.  I see him because he doesn't know how to disguise who he is.  There's more if you want to hear it.
Mrs. Lefferts, I just want to ask a few questions.
Officer White?
Under the house.
What's he doing here, Sid?
Sure, he just tried to throw me off the force last Christmas as a little joke.
And Reynolds?
Pierce isn't like regular people. I dig him, but he scares me too.
You know, when I came out to L.A., this isn't exactly where I saw myself ending up.
Who are you calling?!
Who was that other guy?
Who are they?
What do they have to do with this?
The NSA?
You're crazy.
Wait.
Yeah.
How'd you get around the tap orders?
How'd you have the manpower to--
Jesus.
Why'd you leave?
They come after you?
We're not gonna hurt you.
Tell him we're not gonna hurt him.
No he won't.
We're honest people and we need your help. I'll give you two- hundred dollars if you--
Not particularly, no.
<u>Wildlife</u> footage, for God's sake. I don't see how he could've slipped you something that the FBI would be interested in.
<u>What's</u> your point.
Why?
Daniel's life is already ruined. Maybe if you guys stopped thinking about yourselves for a change and--
How could you let me find out like this?
Robert--
"Sources revealed an FBI investigation into a possible money laundering scheme that may have sent millions of dollars--
"At the center of the investigation are well-known Washington-area attorneys Robert Dean and Rachel Banks."
That's gonna end tonight.
It tastes like fish.
I mean it tastes like every other fish I've ever had. Every fish tastes the same.
Not that much.
We'd like to ask you some questions about Daniel Zavitz.
I'm an investigator with Pro-Tech Security.
Mr. Zavitz was involved in an extortion scheme. We believe he passed you sensitive materials, possibly with your knowledge, and we need to--
We believe he did.
We have good reason to believe that he passed you--
We'd like to recover any materials Mr. Zavitz may have given you--
--otherwise we may have to--
We'd rather not--
Brill.
Alright!
Jesus! I just told you. I don't know.
We believe?
Lyle?!
You're kidding me.
Dean's with Lyle.
So they know everything.
Oh, let's assume that they have.
Resources, that's a good point. He's got resources. All we've got is a <i>six-hundred billion dollar</i> <i>organization!</i> Now god<u>dammit</u>, Hicks, you find 'em. You find 'em and you end it now!
What kind of fossils?
See what's happening to them - the stars.
In an hour there will be no stars. The air is filling with sand.
Marmite - addicted!  Baths - not with other people!  Islands.  Your handwriting.  I could go on all day.  My husband. Almsy nods.
A lie.  What do you hate most?
You will.  You will.
Thank you.  Will you bury Geoffrey?  I know he's dead.
I know.
Try to get a second radiator, we'll bury it between here and the Pottery Hill. And a better jack. We planned badly.
Just kiss me.  It would mean such a lot to me.
Thank you.
Can you cook the rabbit or will you try and bring that back to life?
I can't hide anymore.  I breathe like a dog.  I lose my balance.  Stealing's got harder. Caravaggio stares at the Herodotus.
I don't even know if it is my book. The Bedouin found it in the plane, in the wreckage.  It's mine now. I heard your breathing and thought it might be rain. I'm dying for rain - of course I'm dying anyway - but I long to feel rain on my face.
Off with his head!
Because you're leaning?  No, you're just on an angle.  You're too heavy!
Please, don't waste your time on pleasantries -
Hey! -
I didn't like that book either. It's all about men.  Too many men. Just like this house.
Of course.  When?
Kip I -
Is that what you think?  Is that what you think I think?
I'm thinking about your heart, not your skin.  And how to reach it. And that I don't think I can.  A bomb has ruined us, just not the bomb I thought would ruin us.
Sorry.  I took a Benzedrine.
I insist.  There clearly isn't room for us all, I'm the least able to dig, and I'm not one of the walking wounded. Those are facts.  Besides, if I remain it's the most effective method of persuading my husband to abandon whatever he's doing and rescue us. It's hard to argue with this logic.
I hardly knew the guy. Why be impolite to strangers?
I don't recall asking your permission.
How would you approach him? Hello, Mr. MacDougal, I'm Gin, would you steal a painting with me?
Uh, yes.
Oh, that's quite all right. No charge.
Quite a good one. A Monet. Not major, but it is Giverney.
If I can't trust you to pick up a painting, how can I trust you about the Mask?
Got it.
My job, my rules. We've got a job to do. No mixing business and pleasure.
That's because I wanted them to!
I drilled the bolts and went in through the window. It was the only way to bypass the smart glass.
You need a partner for this job. You'll never find one as good as me.
It was a long time ago.
I've got something for you.
Ready.
A billion dollars.
Okay, look, I'm delivering this to a man who's going to give us the key to our job. But it's pointless to try to explain it yet. You just have to trust me. I don't have any more secrets.
And the money goes--
But those instructions, they're recorded in the computer.
A parting gift from the Empire.
Can't break tradition. It's bad luck.
Hong Kong midnight, happy new year. Except at China Bank.
Nothing is wrong. Everything is the way it has to be. In my left coat pocket is a packet. Passports, hotel reservations, tickets.
Had to get a liquid plasma screen.
You're not the one trying to get all this shit. You think they've just got a Crooks R Us on every corner?
Sure wouldn't want you to be uncomfortable.

Oh, hell.  I'm dyslexic.
Erin Brockovich.  Car accident.  Not her fault, she says.  And she looks like such an honest girl, don't you think?
Right.  Lap-dancers are people too.
Yeah?  I should learn to do stuff like that. They make the place feel real homey.
Well, then -- if you're feeling up to it, maybe we should talk shop.
You said things would be fine, and they're not.
I don't need pity.  I need a paycheck.  And I've looked, but when you've spent the last six years raising babies, it's real hard to convince someone to give you a job that pays worth a damn.  So I figure, since you're the one who said I was gonna be okay, you should be the one to hire me.
I got an interesting call this afternoon. It was from a Dr. Frankel.
He wanted you to know the legal limit for hexavalent chromium, is .05 parts per million.  And that at the rate you mentioned, .58, it could be responsible for the cancers in that family you asked about. The Irvings.
Look, I'm sorry.  You were gone.  I just assumed you were off having fun.
I don't know.  Maybe cause you look like someone who has a lot of fun.
Erin --
Erin --
She lived on the plume.  You never know.
Well, good, Ed.  I like working with you too.
Don't joke.  They might.  So do me a favor and behave yourself for once.  Ed Masry to see Kurt Potter.
I'm not gonna fire you.  I wanted to.  But then you got sick, and that woulda made me look like a shit.  You embarrassed me, Erin.
Sixty-nine.  We've got good answers to all of 'em.
Ross -- you are an absolute angel.
Hi, Rosalind, this is Erin.  Brockovich. From the file room?  I was wondering if you could tell Mr. Masry that I'm following up on that real estate thing out of the office.
I'm gonna go live with George.
I do.
You got more than one?
Ten?
You got a little girl?
Fixing a leak under your sink.
Just a few more minutes, then we can go.  Take her, will you?
Hi.  It's me.  I got a favor to ask you.
It's not for me; it's for my kids.  You're the only one I trust them with.
Jaguar's a darn pretty car.
A lot.  But you hang in there, maybe you'll get one.
Uh-huh?
Come in, Admiral.
You must.  Luke, look at me!
Barks and growls at his boss.
Barks his agreement.
Then I'll see you in Hell.
If I may say so, Sir, I noticed earlier that the entire main para- light system seems to be damaged.
What was it?
An Imperial probe droid.
Probably an asteroid field ....
To get killed ... you're not seriously going into an asteroid field?
That's quite a compliment.
You're going to attack them?!!!
Look, sweetheart, I'm not going to have you accusing my friend of ...
Hyperdrive.
You may call me Leia.
Don't worry about a thing.  I'll get us going.
Not yet.  They're working on it now.
Let's go.
You will be, my young one.  Heh. You will be.
Free your mind and return he will.
Control, control you must learn of what you see.  Not easy, not fast.
Bespin.  I see it too ... Friends you have there, heh?  Concentrate and see them you will.
It is the future you see.
Yes, Sir .... we have visuals ... the System is supposed to be devoid of human forms ...
And we can watch ...
Utopia became depressed after her mother's suicide, began to withdraw into her virtual reality simulator. She'd punch up her own little world in cyberspace and stay in it for days at a time.  Somebody else was in there with her.
He jumped. Down there.  He's dead, Cuervo. I did it. I killed Plissken.
Not anymore.
Having second thoughts?
You don't understand. It's already in you.
I give you my word. Put the prototype into my hands, and you're a free man.
Oh, man... You didn't have to hit me, Snake. I can help you.
Yeah. So how do I get to Venice?
How the hell am I supposed to know? This is your damn city.
Yeah.
So be it, to the death.
You are that and much more. You are its greatest knight, you are what is best in men. Now we will be together--
Because you must! You and only you. Have you forgotten that it was you who freed Excalibur?
Then answer me this. For years peace has reigned in the land. Crops grow in abundance, there is no want. Every one of my subjects enjoys his portion of happiness and justice, even those whose tiresome misunderstandings we must resolve here each day. Tell me, Merlin: have we defeated evil, as it seems?
Your mother told you that?
I grant you your wish if you grant Lady Guenevere hers.
He has given up.
Why?
--What issues from your lust will be mine. Swear it again.
You're telling me that, I should take my daughter to a witch doctor? Is that it?
Me too.
All right then we've got clean rats.
Why the math?
It's the other way around. The society sent me through med school.
Harvard, Bellevue, John Hopkins.
Yes am.
Pretty close.
Sure did.
No I didn't know you had one.
No.
He didn't mention her.
That depends.
The priest.
If he came to me for spritual help, I'd say no.
No I wouldn't. But I'd try to persuade him to turn himself in.
I beg your pardon?
Well, the first thing I'd do is put them into a time macine and send them back to the sixteenth century.
Well it just doesn't happen anymore Mrs. MacNeil.
Since we learned about mental illness, paranoia, schizophrenia. All the things they taught me in Harvard. Mrs. MacNeil since the day I joined the Jesuits, I've never met one priest who has performed an exorcism, not one.
No.
Cause I like it.
I wouldn't talk.
St. Mike's.
Damien Karras.
That's his office back of St. Mike's. He's our psychiatric counsellor. He had a pretty rough knock last night poor guy, his mother passed away. She was living by herself and I guess she was dead a couple of days before they found her.
Sure.
What's playing.
Who's in it?
I've seen it.
No.
Who are you?
As it was in the begin is now and ever shall be, world without end, amen.
Who places her trust in thee, my God.
In the face of the enemy.
Her heart.
She'll go into coma.
Shove it up your ass you faggot!
Fuck him!!!
Fuck him Karras!!! Fuck him!!!
Swimming trunks.
Too bad.  You could use some sun. Really.
We have some lotion.
Suit yourself.
Get your hand off me.
Go fuck yourself.
I don't see any ladies here. Except maybe you.
How we doing?
Am I late?
What's the point?
You want me to show up late a few nights?
Frank.
Frank.  I'm here.  I always get here.  Don't sweat it.
Bosen black.  Flat.
Yeah, okay.
I just thought we should talk about it.  Between ourselves.
I don't know ... She had gum on her lip, for Christ sake. I don't think she's right for the act.
I was just thinking what Ma would think.
And it's especially nice to be among friends tonight, because, well, tonight's a very special night for my brother and I. This evening we've asked a young lady to join us, a lady Jack and I are sure will soon seem like just another old friend to you all.  She's making her debut here this evening and, as far as I'm concerned, she couldn't be doing it in a better place. Because there's one place that's always been for us a very special place, and that place is this place, the Ambassador Lounge.  Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome a very special lady with a very special way of singing a song, Miss Susie Diamond.
First night?
Last?
I'm sorry, Frank.  All that talk about family. I just got emotional.
It won't happen again.  Scout's honor.
Not for me.  I still have to look at the music sometimes, you know that?  Otherwise, I forget. I just forget.  But you.  You never forget. Ever.  So how come you couldn't remember Ma's birthday?
No, let's stay on it.  I'm sick and tired of watching you make him up into some kinda god. For Christ sake, Jack, he died doing a stupid bullshit jig.  He left a wife and two sons.  He wasn't a hero.  He was a fool.
That's right.  I wasn't there.  I don't have the luxury of being a witness to tragedy.
No, fuck you.  And fuck him too. Fuck the both-of you.
Five years ago.  November.
Daughter's.  Sweet sixteen.
She asked for it.
My watch is broken, too.
The problem is I can't hear myself sing with all this...  ... music.  You know what I'm saying?
Switch?  What fucking switch?
Baker's unabridged.
Virgins.
First times. Hey, look at this.
Jack woke up on the wrong side of the bottle.
Thanks, Lloyd.
Uh ... thanks.
Regular hours are eight to five.
You can check in on him tomorrow. Between eight and five.
His kid's sick.
Guess I got a little scattered.
Nervous?
You're kidding.
So, what happened?
Hi.
He's just feeling sorry for himself.  This is it, pal.  Hear me? Two bucks a can.
They never should've voted against U.S. statehood -- the scumbags.  We heard you got wasted.
Should be.  It's yours.
You porked his wife the day he was arrested.  How could you forget that?
A few blanks?  Like what?
Never mind that!  Just take Jamie and get out of that house.  Don't tell anyone where you're going -- especially not him -- just GO.
Think about it, Eve! Everything he's done recently has been peculiar, right?  He's said and done things your husband would never do ...
Don't hang up ...
He'd see that a mile away.  The only person he'd talk to about that bomb is his brother.  Unfortunately, turnips can't talk.
Of course I killed them, you DUMB FUCK.  And torched every shred of evidence that proves who you really are.  Swallow this one, Commander. You are going to be in here for the rest of your life.
Let's not confuse things anymore.  I'm Archer. You're Castor.  But if you need proof --
Trust me, he's already here. Get going!
What happened?
Escaped?  From Erewhon?  I want everyone on this -- our entire force and the SFPD.
No problem.
Wouldn't be the first time -- or would it?
Sure, baby -- go anywhere you want.  But I have to give you an escort.  Security reasons.
I don't know.  Maybe...
Seven.  Really.
Who did?
Uhh...thanks...slightly better looking though, right?
Great room...
Its your birthday? Today?  Whats your name?  Where were you born?
I don't do that.  That's just not for me...
Brought what on myself?! I didnt do anything!
You mean because you thought I was cocky Im now on a permanent acid trip?!!
Ticket bad.  You draw in lines with pencil.
You draw lines with pencil!  I know about this!
Thanks.  To you too...
About the plane? What do you think its gonna crash? Dont say that...
Uh huh...
Do what?
Long, boring, and generally pretty sad. Arnie seemed to enjoy it...  Hey, wheres that chocolate cake...?
Enjoy it, sweetheart...
Its wonderful...
What are you talking about, Jack?
Im moving to Paris...it was right here...  Its a box marked Jack.  I put it in the stack for the Salvation Army...
But youre not interested in boutique dollars...  I get it...
Jersey?  You know what the traffic's gonna be like?
You wouldn't say that, if you could see me.
Ben, think about all the people we can help if this works --
We got what we wanted.  That's <u>enough</u>.
I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws?
Well maybe <u>you</u> should date him.
Forget it, egghead.  I'm good as is.
Just get back soon, or I start looking for a new groom.
And you can?  Power it up?
And they're changing into...
Like the shields Reed said would protect us.  How long?
What do you mean "complete"?
This place is deluxe.  You got cable?
Stay right.  Left is trouble.
Last one down springs for room service.
Dude.  That's my sister.
Recording, sir.  We see you perfectly.
Sure.
I was talking about us.  Working together.
We need to get past them.
The plants, from space.  Their particles are still charged.  With the right amount of energy, those ions could <u>create</u> the elemental profile of the cosmic storm.
Why didn't you say something?
I told you, I'm fine.  It's <u>you</u> I'm worried about.
Please, no apologies.  I've arranged for your things to be moved to one of my condos.  You'll have round-the clock care.
Medical's ready.
I can't help it. I'm just weak, I guess.
We have no choice. Duval's the most skillful brain surgeon in the country, and he's right here, at hand.
Why don't you go on. We'll meet you at the Clearance Desk in a few minutes.
Yes, Cora.
Not in the hands of a great surgeon like Dr. Duval. The beam of this laser can be regulated to one millionth of a millimeter.
I've been with him since I got out of school. He brought me into the CMDF, over five years ago.
Not working for someone like Dr. Duval --
I can't till the hatch is flooded!
You can't believe all that's accidental? That there isn't a Creative Intelligence at work --
They all lead to the same place -- the Lungs.
At an operation?
Surgical assassination?! But that means you suspect --
Well, we better get on with it.
Let's hope they realize the danger.  Captain, I'll give you a new compass heading.
They can't reduce nuclear fuel. But once the Reactor's Miniaturized -- along with the submarine -- a microscopic particle should emit enough energy to activate it.
It should work -- theoretically. If it doesn't, the mission's off. The craft's nuclear-powered. Except for your wireless.
Look at those Walls up ahead!
We're entering a Capillary. Remain in the middle.
It's less than one ten-thousandth of an inch thick. And porous.
I don't know. Few munce.
...What're you talking about?
We split that.
Oh, for Christ's sake, where's my goddamn checkbook. Let's get this over with.
In what way?
Can you be any more specific?
Was he funny-looking apart from that?
So you were having sex with the little fella, then?
Is there anything else you can tell me about him?
And what about the other fella?
Yah!
They're gonna call, give me instructions for a drop. I'm supposed to have the money ready tomorrow.
...Brainerd?
...Babe the Blue Ox?
No. No, ma'am.
It's okay, Scotty.
Be back in a minute. If Stan calls you, just tell him I went to Embers. Oh, geez -
Yah, but I - okay, I would, I'd guarantee ya your money back.
Yah.
Yah.
Gotta go?
Well, you do reside their at 1425 Fremont Terrace?
Anyone else residing there?
Well, Mr. Proudfoot, this call came in past three in the morning.  It's just hard for me to believe you can't remember anyone calling.
Copy. Yah, send me back-up!
Yah, Menominie only has Chief Perpich and he takes February off to go to Boundary Waters.
We called his house; his little boy said he hadn't been there.
She's visiting relatives in Florida. Now his boss, this guy Gustafson, he's also disappeared. Nobody at his office knows where he is.
His wife's in the hospital, has been for a couple months. The big C.
And this Shep Proudfoot character, he's a little darling. He's now wanted for assault and parole violation. He clobbered a neighbor of his last night and another person who could be one of your perps, and he's at large.
Well, they're all out on the wire. Well, you know...
We're still men.
Six months ago, Bob's testicles were removed.  Then hormone therapy.  He developed bitch tits because his testosterone was too high and his body upped the estrogen.  That was where my head fit -- into his huge, sweating tits that hung enormous, the way we think of God's as big.
Just who the fuck do you think you are?!  Get out!  You're fired!
Really?
This isn't a for-real suicide thing. This is probably one of those cry-for- help things.
So you're staying in tonight?
No... no problem.
Give me a minute, Marla, alright... just sixty seconds.
Absolutely, you have every right.  I need you to do me a favor.
Don't ask.
Okay, everyone.
The spork.  I get it.  You're very clever.
How's that working out for you?
Being clever.
Keep it up, then.  Keep it right up.
I don't know, either.  I want to find out.  I've never been hit, have you?
I don't want to die without any scars.  How much can you really know about yourself if you've never been in a fight?  Come on... you're the only person I've ever asked.
Soldier of Fortune.  Business Week. New Republic.
Uh... nah...
Fuck damnation.  Fuck redemption.  We are God's unwanted children, with no special place and no special attention, and so be it.
Hey.
... is over.
You... you can't be serious about this.
I can't let you...
I'm going to...
I'm not going...
Stop finishing...
I think this is about where we came in.
i... ann....iinn.. ff....nnyin...
What?
What?
What?
Why?
What did you want to be, Raymond K. Hessel?
I...I...
I have to save Eugene!
That's why Death is working backwards. It's tying up all the loose ends, sealing the rift once and for all This chapter of the screenplay contains scene that do not appear or occur elsewhere in the final movie. In order to maintain the integrity of the screenplay, it has not been edited.
Good.  Cause we just got some new info and I don't need you getting freaky on me.
Evan Shaeffer's dead.  Guess he wasn't as lucky as we thought.
Yeah?
I'm not following you --
Don't worry.  Nothing can happen to us.
Get ready to smile, five guys per girl.
I know, honey.  I just --
Yeah?
Ohmygod! OHMYGOD!  OHMYGOD!  He's not dead?
We're takin' you to a cabin in the woods, it's only a couple miles from my house.  Keep off the highways, they'll be lookin' for us.
I don't.
That's a plan.
Billy! I'm gettin' a vision!  You're the next one...
'Cause if you say another word, I'm gonna fuckn' kill ya!
Huh?
That's right, buddy.
Start over.
There's a compass in the handle.
I need a vacation.
Duck soup.
Yes.  But I lose many merits in next life.  Very bad.
They heard about escaped prisoner on radio.  Make deal.  More than we pay.
Sorry, Sir.  Can't do it.
Sorry, Sir.
POWs?  I don't know.  But either way it'll get that subcommittee off our necks.  Cream?
The League of Families leans on Congress.  Then they lean on us. Like we don't have enough to worry about in a dozen dirtwater countries.  Damnit!
De Fravio.  Dave De Fravio. Lieutenant... Air Force.
But now it's free, right?
Really?
Yeah, well... suicidal paranoiacs say funny things sometimes.
The moron?
And who's Lydia?
What?  The curse'll be lifted?  <u>Will</u> <u>you please</u>!
Don't treat me like I'm stupid.  It pisses me off.
What does that mean?
Well, what the hell does that mean?
... I would love to start looking at least.  You know, maybe a two bedroom or even, maybe the top floor of a house -- like in Brooklyn or Staten Island...
I... I... went to this bar... this very, ya know -- hard-to-get-in place... called Babbitt's...
I'm a man with a mission, Jack.
Yes. Hi..Congratulations. Jack Lucas. Nice to meet you finally. This is Anne Napolitano, the owner of Video Spot.
Hahahahaaa... Nononono... Not yet... Hahahaha...
Funny -- you look married.
Please don't hug me in public again, O.K.?
Come on, try it. Ya feel the air on your body - ya little fella's flappin' in the breeze. ...everybody in the city is busy with their business and no one knows we're bare assed in the middle of it. Come on!
<u>Fag..a</u> <u>fag</u> <u>you</u> <u>say!?</u>... <u>"Curst</u> <u>wolf!</u> <u>Thy</u> <u>fury</u> <u>inward</u> <u>on</u> <u>thyself</u> <u>Pray</u> <u>and</u> <u>consume</u> <u>thee!"</u>
Well - empires have fallen because of trashy romances...
I hope that's all you gotta say, El, 'cause I'm about as tired of your mouth as I am workin' this stinkin' hole!
Right. Now show me a little somethin' this time, okay? Give me some form...
Shut up! All of you!
Wait a sec. I want Tita to take a picture of you an' me in front of the place...
I didn't get it, did I?
Hi, Tita.
Wait...
I don't know.
Bye, Robert.
Thank you.
That's right.
Yes.
I hope it will, yes.  I'm sorry.
All right, let's have a rematch.
I took some aspirin and it really upset my stomach.
Steam.
I'm wit' Carlos.
I can't!
If we were at 10th Street Pool you woulda done it right in the water, right?
Positive.
Positive.
Your friend must be misinformed.
Whaddyamean 'maybe'?
He doesn't know? How come he doesn't know?
Sonofabitch.
I have no idea.
He never leaves the beach, Fat Sam. Never leaves. Sits in that chair, he's outta junk. Then he suddenly gets up, he's got junk. So where does it come from? Through the sand?
I ought to get some sleep.
Nineteen.
What'll it be Fletch?
We play tennis at the club.
Yes.
Well, I haven't played in a while because of these kidney pains.
That's Babar.
One. B-a-b-a-r.
But not right next to each other. I thought that's what you meant.
I don't know. I don't have any.
No books. No elephants either. No really good elephant books.
What about breaking and entering?  Are you wearing anything under that?
I hate to conduct business on the lanai. Why don't we step inside.
The thing that really tipped it off for me was something your wife said to me while we were in bed together.
And they're still married... Alan and Sally Ann.
I dunno. Somewhere in South America, I forget.
Maybe, Fletch. Is that Brazil?
Yeah. Maybe.
Sure.
You kidding? I got an unbelievable story here, Lar. Un-believable. Jesus. It's the cops, I know it. The Chief! And they're all over Frank.
Check every hotel in L.A. Start with the ones near the airport. Yeah. He's about to leave the country with her. Thanks, Lar.
None of your business, now go away. You're throwing my game off.
What is this?
I think you better sit down.
Gail, please.
What?
You broke it? You know the source?
Frieda's boss.
My secretary.
Excuse me?
What did these Vancouver factories do?
Assistant.  And don't call me Jazz.
Exactly.
Go on, 'they're stahting.'
Oh, Jazz, those bastards... call an ambulance!  Get that music off!
Fluck you!
People still watch that?
Smooth.  I know this is dangerous and everything but it's kind of fun. Ever see "Batman," you know when Batman and Robin are climbing up the side of the building and somebody sticks their head outside the window and says... I forget what they said but it's pretty funny.
Tell me, Dr. Watson, what makes you think he's not just another piece of shit overdose.
What kind of sentimental bullshit is this?
Who's my real father, man?
You gotta be kidding!  This is unfuckingbelievable!  I have to start the evening crawling down Capital Records, I shoulda chose suicide then, but oh no, the night was young!  Next up, my guitar! The second most important thing I own and now it's toothpicks for the homeless on Hollywood Boulevard!  Then, then, after I burned up your brother, Jazz... I should say as a fucking footnote I've usually treated women like shit -- used corsages, the wet spot, you know giving out Domino's Pizza's phone number and saying it's mine... Tonight was different. I felt respect.  I felt love.  Then Jazz left me... and <u>now</u> I get to die!
Let me go out like a man.
Oh God, please, <u>don't</u>!
You're a poet and didn't know it.
Only on a first name basis.
That's funny, you're cute.
I'll tell you when somebody pays me to give a shit and stuff.
No - no.
Who's this --
Il fallait le faire.
Je crois qu'on fait une erreur de le prendre avec nous.
J'ai pas confiance en lui.
He got off on six.
Who's on him?
Hey, I thought we come for a drink.
This could be it, Walter.  This Candy Store guy, putting on a big show in a fancy nightclub with known connections all over him. Then on our own, after working the whole day and night, we tail him out to Brooklyn and sit on him for a week practically, and who do we come up with?  Joel Weinstock.  You gotta let us have it.
This is my case.  Get these guys off my back and let me handle it.
I been damn careful up to now.
I'm straight, Joel.  They haven't got shit on me.  Look, I'm tellin' you, he'll take the deal somewhere else.
I'm alright, Gibby.
Sure.
Frank...
How's that?
Frank, please...
Frank, this is insane...
Go watch the game?  Go watch the fucking game?  Frank, they're gonna make you for Sissy Clark's murderer.  It matches the Nightingale's profile.  You understand what that means?
Look, I don't really remember how this thing works.
Pal, my whole life's an emergency.
I'm dreaming this.  Shit, this is a dream.
I'm trying to be, Dad.  I'm tyrin'.  It's good to hear your voice.  I missed you...so much.
October 22, 1969.
H-hi.
Yeah, Dad.  What the hell is going on?
Huh?
Fire?  What are you talking about?  He had cancer, John.
Yeah, lung cancer.  Ten years ago.
That wasn't luck, Johnny boy.  That was smarts and ten plus on the job.
Yeah, that's right.
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
You have the right to speak to an att --
It's a small world, Carl.  And I'm gonna find you.  Real soon.
Cool it, Andy.
I think it's called "a shower". You might try it sometime.
Will you come with me?
Did you stay here last night?
Somebody was in here.
I'm serious.  Doesn't this look a little strange to you?
You're Shelly?
Maybe.
Great.  Just great.
Stay cool?  You ain't Dirty Harry. Now stop it.
This is a man's game.  Requiring a man's cunning and intelligence...
Yes, Megan.  Tommy Jarvis is a killer.  A very deranged boy who wants you to believe that...
It probably wouldn't have any effect on him.  The only sure way to stop Jason is to return him to his original resting place, where he drowned in 1957.
Crystal Lake...where the nightmare began.
We'll scare 'em right back.
Yeah.  Jason murdered them and...
Yes, but they released me because...
If I had you where I really wanted you, they'd be pumping your ass full of formaldehyde.
Yes.
Sorry, Di.  I was just going to my car.  I didn't mean to frighten you...
Her name's Stephanie.
Okay.
What am I gonna do -- I'm locked up in a friggin' cell?!
Okay.
Really?
Nothing.
This is Jason's fault!
And neither do you. It's up to Rennie to decide what she wants to do.
And she sure doesn't have one now, either. She needs to live.
No, I think it's just the beginning.
I don't think that's such a safe idea
I...I can't...
About four years ago...at Crystal Lake. I spent a few summers there with Uncle Charles inbetween boarding school.
Where are they?
What do you mean, we must abandon?
Asbestos lining.
Do not inhale.
`The most interesting thing about Elliot Litvak is that he writes the way he looks -- fuzzy, grubby and shifty-eyed.'  I'm telling you as a friend.
There are things that speak to us from the past.
The Red Sox blow a chance to win their first World Series since 1918. You expect me to miss that for an opening night?
Except I won't have a father anymore.
Yes.
Life is good.
Five's not so many. There were families with seven kids. A grandmother. A dimwit uncle.
You know the answer to that.
They're only gonna lose.
The Red Sox are your problem. I never understood about you and the Red Sox. Everybody rooted for the Yankees.
It's a simple subject.
I went to college in Boston so I could be near the Red Sox. I took summer classes and the cut them to go to the game. My wife is from Boston. Lillian Ziegler?
If you're such a devoted fan, why were you at the play tonight instead of the game? Answer carefully. This is important. You could have gone to the theater last night. There was no game last night.
Get the hell out of here. I don't want you bringing our food. Send a real waiter.
I'm actually beginning to enjoy this.
There's no room! And the air is lovely.
Nothing's more dangerous, especially for an old man.
It does. We must be getting old, Charlie.
We must end the campaign.
Hm.  Is it?
I'll send my gardener. I'm sure you'll have much to discuss.
That was England.
Very well.
Have you found him?
Don't worry.  You'll probably do just as well singing to him in the womb.  We can implant the most successful pre-embryo tomorrow afternoon.
It's still possible the eyelash specimen came from a janitor, delivery man--it could have blown in through an open window.
Thank you, no.
You're so unconcerned that you have a killer in your midst.
No, but since there aren't too many <i>live</i> ones tonight either, you won't mind us conducting one further sweep.  If he does not work here, then there should be no other trace of him.  I think you'd better get some people out of bed, Detective.  In the meantime we can re-check his favorite haunt.
At least you're honest.  Call me by my middle name--Eugene--If you're going to be Jerome, you may as well start getting used to it.
Keep going!!  Keep going!!
I'm sure I could have.
In case you get back before I do.
I'm travelling too.
I'd have to bleach my hair.
How tall are you?
Yes...<i>yes</i>...
Why would I be angry?  It was beautiful.
I forgot something--something at home. I'll see you later.
I'm not doing it.
And you got him...
Yeah.
I want to take a walk.
Listen, I'm just as nervous as you are.
Really.
If it's funny I'm going to laugh.
That bad?
You bastard...
If I hadn't killed Beynon., you would have.
Yeah.
Who was it?
Thanks. Hope you do too.
I kinda doubt it.
I Just want to find a suitcase.
I know.
Who sent you, Thorpey?
What?
I work for him.
Yes, I do.
Not entirely. No.
Sure I'm sure.
At me friend's house.
Wilton Estate.
Where you off to?
My brother, Frank.
Funny.  Can I phone London?
What's that gun doing in your room? Suppose I phoned the police and told them there's a bloke staying in my hotel who's planning to shoot somebody?
How'd you know I wouldn't?
What's that supposed to mean?
I've always ad your welfare at heart, Eric. Besides which, I'm nosy.
And you should know, if I remember rightly.
We've got to take you back to London.
That, Harry? That's another hundred - twenty-five pounds notes of the realm.
Three hundred altogether, Harry.
No.
The Glengarry...the premium leads...? I'd say we got five thousand.  Five. Five thousand leads.
Yes.
Graff?  Because I worked for him.
No.  What do you mean?  Have I talked to him about this?
What?
You have to steal the leads tonight?
You're, you're saying so you have to go in there tonight and...
I'm sorry?
What do you care...?
Where did Moss...?  I...
Uh, uh, did he go to the restaurant?  I...I... 
That they're going to be upset.
Please don't leave.  I'm going to talk to you.  What's your name?
...and what is that, John?  What? Bad luck.  That's all it is.  I pray in your life you will never find it runs in streaks.  That's what it does, that's all it's doing. Streaks.  I pray it misses you. That's all I want to say.
What two?
...you want to see the court records?  John?  Eh?  You want to go down...
...do you want to go downtown...?
...then...
...then what is this "you say" shit, what is that?  What is that...?
No.  You're right.  That's for later.  We'll talk in a month. What have you got?  I want two sits. Tonight.
I saw the board.  You've got four...
Bullshit.  They ain't been in the office yet.  Give 'em some stiff. We have a deal or not?  Eh?  Two sits.  The Des Plaines.  Both of 'em, six and ten, you can do it...six and ten...eight and eleven, I don't give a shit, you set 'em up?  Alright?  The two sits in Des Plaines.
Good.  Now we're talking.
It's better than a good sale.  It's a...
All that I'm telling you: that one thing you can tell them it's a remarkable sale.
What does that fucking mean?
Why should the sale not stick? Hey, fuck you.  That's what I'm saying.  You have no idea of your job.  A man's his job and you're fucked at yours.  You hear what I'm saying to you?  Your "end of month board..." You can't run an office. I don't care.  You don't know what it is, you don't have the sense, you don't have the balls.  You ever been on a sit?  Ever?  Has this cocksucker ever been...you ever sit down with a cust...
You've got a big mouth, and now I'm going to show you an even bigger one. 
Fuck is that supposed to mean?
Ricky?...That I don't care they stole the contracts?
"You have to believe in yourself... you"--look--"alright...?"
Go ahead.
No, his wife is.
Twelve-fifteen.
Didn't I say I was taking the two o'...
Oh, my God, you're right!  I'm on the one...  Well, let's scoot...
Jim!  What are you doing here?  Jim Lingk, D. Ray Morton...
It's not me, it's my wife.
I told you.
What, they beat you with a rubber bat?
You going to turn State's?
Did they...
The...
Well I'm going to worry about it, and so are you, so shut up and listen.  I GET HIS ACTION.  My stuff is mine, whatever he gets for himself, I'm talking half.  You put me in with him.
She couldn't decide.
Relax, Freddie honey.  Come dance with me.
Get a good night's sleep.  We got a new suit, new shirt, new tie, and I'm going to shave you myself. Tomorrow we want you to look respectable for fifty million of your fellow Americans.
We have a special home for you for the rest of your life.  Nobody gets near you.  You're not going any place.
It was hard to have him killed.
It was hard to have him killed.
It was Frankie tried to have me hit.
You know otherwise, Freddie?
Chi?
I know.  I went down to the Barrett house.  But she's gone.  They drove her and the kids to North Tahoe airport.
I was in my house.  Willy tried, but it would have taken some strong-arm to stop her, and he figured you wouldn't want that.
I took care of it.
A little care he can ride in with an electric motor.
Your plans are a little different this time.  You skip Miami, and go straight to Geneva.  It's to be deposited to this number.  And it's got to be there by Monday morning, no slip-up.
Our mistake.  But what does it matter; it was our money.  We don't even expect thanks.
We'll keep it quiet; the people who know are trustworthy...the Committee needn't find out.
Simple.  Be friendly like us.  Not hostile.
I wanted to see you before you went back to Nevada.  Also, the children - Michael, they're here.
In a minute.  They're outside with Esther.  I'm very happy for you... I suppose I knew that you're simply too smart for anyone ever to beat you.
I'm not going to stay long; I can't.
I think it's too late for changes, Michael.  I promised myself I wouldn't talk about it and I've gone and spoiled it.
Tell me, Michael.  What really happened with Pentangeli?
I didn't even know he had a brother. And where is he now?
And that's all he had to do.  Just show his face.
You would have killed his brother?
You'll be there to see it; you'll be there.
Let him gamble.
I'm going to squeeze you, Corleone, because I don't like you; I don't like the kind of man you are.  I despise your masquerade, and the dishonest way you pose yourself and your fucking family.
Like hell!  And who the hell are you to give me orders.  Watch your manners or you'll be on your Sicilian ass in the street there.
It means it's too cold to go swimming.  And I don't mean the water.
Yeah, and I'm never going to smoke another cigarette.
That's okay, Hanna.  I'm more comfortable in here.  It is Hanna, isn't it?
Mornin'.
Nice place.
Boone.  Clayton Boone.
Just that I was in the Marines.
Excellent.  We'll have a most interesting time.
All right, I guess.
I'm fine.  I'd just rather keep it on.
You first.
Do I look okay?
Just a night out.  Sounds like she can't say no to her daughter.
Good.  Let's get dry.
I'm very sorry.
That's where you're wrong, Clayton. You've just told one.  A very good story indeed.
Relax, Clayton.  I can't hear you. I can't hear a word.
You ever hear of this Whale fellow?
It's the ridiculous pills they prescribe.  If I take them, I spend the next day stupid as a stone. If I don't, my mind seems to go off in a hundred directions at once --
I wanted to be alert for your visit today.  Especially since I saw so little of you in the hospital.
Bring a mirror.  Let the Bride feast upon her visage.
Luminal.
A visitor.
Your father was a schoolmaster?
Maybe you'd like a swim when we're through.  I never swim myself, so the pool tends to go to waste.
Righto.  Let me see.
Is there someplace we can talk?
My version of "take this job and shove it..."
"don't want" the Dodgers to lose or the summer to end. But we don't get to choose these things...
You know my back -
How's Atley -- ?
Let them go --
Let them go. And I'll leave ...
You don't have anything on me. A misdee auto-theft. I got no record. I'll be out in three days, and back at it. Or you let them go, and I give you my word. I'm gone. And without the ringleader ... Your tee-times have just grown exponentially...
Consider me gone, Detective --
Double-meaning intended --
Very good. Think you can get in without waking her up -- ?
That's an after-market alarm. Can't just cut her wires ...
Jonathan Quayle Higgins ...
one minute -- !
No.
Atley Jackson came to see me ...
Yes, sir -
You, too
What?
Nah.
I dunno. Whatever will be will be...
No problem -
For real?
If you change your mind. We're at Otto's. It's 50 ladies in 24 hours. For The Carpenter. 200 K and Kip's life on the felt. So long now ...
No. Open her ...
Kip's not clear yet. We got one more to go --
And the moral of that story is -- ?
So she flies -
Look at Jeannie's kid.
The oldest one.  He was in an argument. A lousy ten-dollar card game. The kid pulls out a gun. It goes off. The kid gets killed. The grandmother hears it and finds out he's been arrested. She has a heart attack.  She drops dead right on the spot. Now Jeannie's got a husband and son in jail and a mother in the funeral parlor.
No. Come on. It was the younger one that was the bad one.
Thirty-two hundred bucks. That's what he gave me. Thirty-two hundred bucks for a lifetime. It wouldn't have paid for the coffin.
That again.
What did he say, exactly?
Paul will calm down. You'll see.
What lions? I'm not going near any lions.
What are you gonna do? Fight with him?  He wants his money.
I don't care. I need my hat.  I won't go without it.
He's with his friends.
He's a grown man. Be doesn't have to call every five minutes.
Don't bring that up. You're the one who wanted us here.
Fuck you, you fat fuck.
No, and we got four of 'em.
Week after I'm twenty-one.
Yeah, sit in a room and do long division for the next fifty years.
Yeah, be a fuckin' lab rat.
What do I want a way outta here for? I want to live here the rest of my life. I want to be your next door neighbor. I want to take out kids to little league together up Foley Field.
Chuckie, what are you talkin'...
Why is it always this? I owe it to myself? What if I don't want to?
You don't know that.
What? No. This is my mother's house. I don't live with my mother. I just stop by, help out. I'm good like that.
She'll live.  If she starts yelling again I might have to run in real quick and beat her with the stick again but...
Let's take a walk. EXT. CHUCKIE'S STREET -- DAY
So why don't you give me my sandwhich?
Yah, all right...
I told you, I just got change.
Why you gotta be an asshole Chuckie?
Why don't you beat off at your house?
Elementary? Oh, I don't doubt that it was. I remember the class, it was just between recess and lunch.
No, no. Nothing like that. I just need his name. TERRY I can't give you his name unless you have a complaint.
Well, he didn't show up for work today...
Okay...don't forget to get another therapist for next week.
Listen, I'll be nearby so, if you need some help, or you get stuck again, don't be afraid to give me a call.
He was alive over a hundred years ago. He was Indian. Dots, not feathers...
Who?
What's the point?
There is somebody...
He was my roommate in college.
Do you find it hard to hide the fact that you're gay?
C'mon, I read your book. I talked to you. It's just something I know to be true.
Buddy, two seconds ago you were ready to give me a jump.
I'm sure you do. You probably got a real nice house, nice car -- your book's a best seller.
Look, man. I don't care if you're putting from the rough. There are solid arguments that some of the greatest people in history were gay; Alexander the Great, Caeser, Shakespeare, Oscar Wilde, Napoleon, Gertrude Stein, not to mention Danny Terrio, not many straight men can dance like that.
If you wanna hit "Ramrod," take your shot. Take some pride in it. You go to church? So fuckin' what, God loves you. I mean, Christ. A guy as well known as you? By the time you put your disguise on and skulk out of the house Sunday nights you probably look like "Inspector Cluseau."
I was thinking about what you said to me the other day, about my painting. I stayed up half the night thinking about it and then something occured to me and I fell into a deep peaceful sleep and haven't thought about you since. You know what occurred to me?
You're just a boy. You don't have the faintest idea what you're talking about.
You've never been out of Boston.
So if I asked you about art you could give me the skinny on every art book ever written...Michelangelo? You know a lot about him I bet. Life's work, criticisms, political aspirations. But you couldn't tell me what it smells like in the Sistine Chapel. You've never stood there and looked up at that beautiful ceiling. And if I asked you about women I'm sure you could give me a syllabus of your personal favorites, and maybe you've been laid a few times too. But you couldn't tell me how it feels to wake up next to a woman and be truly happy. If I asked you about war you could refer me to a bevy of fictional and non-fictional material, but you've never been in one. You've never held your best friend's head in your lap and watched him draw his last breath, looking to you for help. And if I asked you about love I'd get a sonnet, but you've never looked at a woman and been truly vulnerable. Known that someone could kill you with a look. That someone could rescue you from grief. That God had put an angel on Earth just for you. And you wouldn't know how it felt to be her angel. To have the love be there for her forever. Through anything, through cancer. You wouldn't know about sleeping sitting up in a hospital room for two months holding her hand and not leaving because the doctors could see in your eyes that the term "visiting hours" didn't apply to you. And you wouldn't know about real loss, because that only occurs when you lose something you love more than yourself, and you've never dared to love anything that much. I look at you and I don't see an intelligent confident man, I don't see a peer, and I don't see my equal. I see a boy. Nobody could possibly understand you, right Will? Yet you presume to know so much about me because of a painting you saw. You must know everything about me. You're an orphan, right?
Not to me, they're not.
Not without a heater and some serious smelling salts, no...
Oh, what? You're going to take the professor's side on this?
I didn't want the job.
I didn't ask for this.
Why is it a cop-out? I don't see anythin' wrong with layin' brick, that's somebody's home I'm buildin'. Or fixin' somebody's car, somebody's gonna get to work the next day 'cause of me. There's honor in that.
Does this violate the patient/doctor relationship?
No...I was hoping to get a kiss.
Then on behalf of my weiner, I'd like to ask for an advance.
Goodbye.
We're goin' to California, ain't we? Awright then, let's *go* to California.
I never had my house pushed over before. I never had my fambly stuck out on the road. I never had to lose... ever'thing I had in life.
I don't know what these cops got to do with it but I don't like it.  An' these here are our own people, all of 'em. I don't like this.
Okay, mister. Whatcha payin'?
Two an' a half! Say, mister, a man can't make his dinner on that.
But--but how we gonna eat?
Which way is House 25?
I ain't no preacher anymore.
I hear it. I think they's some guys comin' this way, lots of 'em. We better get outa here.
What you mean?
You been acrost?
If we broke down maybe somebody'd give us a han'.
It don't take no nerve to do somep'n when there ain't nothin' else you can do. 
Take her with you!
No'm.
Don't matter. Just got to go--an' keep a-goin', till we get plenty a distance away from here.
On a gallon a gas?  Let's set up the tent. Maybe I can fix us up some stew.
Girl with a baby *always* gets prettier.
But it don't seem possible--kicked off like that!
California, here we come!
Look at 'em! Same yella han'bill-- 800 pickers wanted. Awright, this man wants 800 men. So he prints up 5,000 a them han'bills an' maybe 20,000 people sees 'em. An' maybe two-three thousan' starts movin, wes' account a this han'bill. Two- three thousan' folks that's crazy with worry headin' out for 800 jobs! Does that make sense?
I never--
What?
Computer guy.
I sell BMW's. What do you do?
It's nice to see you again.
This night, this reunion will be an important step in our relationship.
Don't rush to judgement until all the facts are in.
Get the fuck outta here.
You're a government spook?
If I get antsy I'll kill a few small animals.
Whole-grain pancakes. And an egg- white omelette.
Those all seem kind of related...
If he does our job, he's our job.
It's fine.
I've looked at it.
You too.
So what are you doing with your life now, son?
That's good.
Branding?  I haven't branded in years.
Just polite. Well, maybe you'd like to try riding again, some time before you go home.
Not really. I'd forgotten how long it's been since I've done this. And I couldn't get any Parmesan cheese.
I am comfortable.
The point was to love each other.
I already did.  This morning. When you went running.
I didn't know I had to.
You already did.
Yeah, he's going to think about it. You want me to pack for you?
Yeah, well, you've done a great job.
So do you.
Good.
Yeah. Bye.
I had to excuse myself from a meeting. It's ridiculous. I kept thinking about the baby... you... and, I swear, I was going to start bawling right into my briefs.
I love you.
Yeah, but nothing I can't handle. Lucy tells me she thinks Gottchalks's plotting, but what else is new.
You know, I just asked that myself tonight. He doesn't know.
Okay.
You want to take a walk with me?
I don't know. Let's just go and... we'll see...
Oh, you can just set up on the dining table. I have to rearrange my shelves tomorrow.
Well, I am going to go after lunch.
What?
Weekend after next...
Twice a month they give you a day off to work on the ranch.
I don't know if I can with my leg.
Can I come? I'll start a fire...
NO!
Hey, Rona. Sorry I'm late.
Record the tones that the coins make. And hang up and get your money back!
...IF it weren't run by a bunch of profiteering gluttons!
The sensitive type.
...as they snoop onto us.
Phreak and Joey are being framed. We need your help to figure out what's on this disc.
Yeah, mom?
I'm taking over a TV network.
I got it. But listen, Kate didn't know what's on it. I mean, she came to me to figure it out. She's not the one who planted the virus. You leave her alone.
Fucked if I care, man.
It's cool, I'm just looking.
Yeah?
I'll make it up to you!
I'll hack the Gibson.
You would have looked better.
What's going on? Let go of me! Stewardess! I'll never fly this airline again!
You're hopeless, man, utterly hopeless.
Well luckily, you have a gifted and talented security officer. I traced the hacker's call. The secret service picked him up this morning. I'll just search his files for the original virus code, and then I can eliminate it.
Jamie needs a Halloween costume.
I don't know!
You guys always look great.
I know, and next to that is the police, hospital, fire, and probably National Guard.
If Loomis read memos he's be here. Fortunately his position is more ceremonial then medical. My hope is that he's either transfer, retire, or die.
I know you miss your parents, its hasn't been that long.
Your mother used to baby-sit me when I was your age.  I bet you didn't know that.
Come on Jamie, lets go back to bed.  Come on Sunday.
This is great Rachel. Come on.
Dad, what's going on?
Why?
This is 132, over.
Least I'm not alone.
Yes. Michael Myers is in hell, buried, where he belongs.
Huh?
That man who drove by so fast, the one you yelled at.
If you watch her, I'll CONSIDER talking to Ben Tramer in the morning.
He was. Old jerko found a way to sneak out. Listen, I'll call you in an hour or so.
And I can't keep you interested?
Could have...
Nothing. I was just sitting down for the first time tonight.
No. I thought she'd be home by now. She went to pick up Paul.
They probably stopped off somewhere. Have her call me when she gets back. I've got Lyndsey here and I want to know what time to put her to bed.
Have a good time.
After the movie.
After the Jack-O-Lantern.
There is no such thing.
Do you believe everything that Richie tells you?
Tommy, Halloween night is when you play tricks on people and scare them. It's all make believe.
You're coming with us...
Mm-mm!
Look at this.
Yeah.
Right.
Do you remember that summer in France?  Hannah, you had jet lag for six straight weeks.
Yes.
Really?!
Yeah?
Uh-huh.
Oh, Elliot!
What are you doing here?
Oh, what, in this section of town?
You're out looking here?
Ohhhh!
Oh.  Well, I live--
Yes, I do.
Oh, I was just going to my AA meeting. ELLIOT Oh, my goodness.  Well, why do you still go to those?  You never tough alcohol.
Oh, no, I can't let you get me that. That's too much.
No, I don't think so.
Uh, uh, this is great.  I mean, I love e.e. cummings, but I can't let you get this.
Well, sure.
Oh, right.
Oh, please, I have to go.  I have to get my teeth cleaned.
I care a great deal about him, yes.
Ah, it's over!  Elliot, I mean it. It's over!
Are you angry with me?
Do you feel, um...are you disenchanted with our marriage?
Are you in love with someone else?
And we drink to her, and we all congratulate her on her wonderful accomplishment during this last year...her great success in A Doll's House!
I don't understand.  Aren't you frightened?
Yeah, I know.  But never to exist again!
Well, it certainly doesn't look promising.
Oh, no, no, no.  He's my sister's husband.  And I think if you gave him half a chance, you'd like him. He's very intelligent.
You know... 
Well, I don't realize it now, I know it all the time, but, but I managed to stick it in the back of my mind...
Oh, me, I'm okay.
No.
How are you?
You know, how's everything?  You doing okay?  How's Frederick?  I mean, Elliot.
Everything's good.  Everything's fine.
Here, you guys.  Open them up.
W-w-we-we've decided after a lot of discussion that we-we'd try with artificial insemination.
Someday, I'll pay it all back.
Two thousand dollars.
Here.  Be careful with those.
No, I didn't, I, that's no.  No, I- I-I, no, I-I just...  hate to see you put yourself in a position where, where you get hurt, you know.  You know, you know how you take...
Well-well, like what?
Yeah, we're having some problems, but problems that are my business...which I don't see how you could know about in such detail. How does Lee know about these things?  How?  They're private!
...in a really horrible way.
You look wonderful.  You do.  What happened to you?
Well, I hope you've changed.
Yeah, and for yours.  I'm sure you've changed.
I am.  You-you made my day.
It was just great.  Uh, I was all set...I was set to be bored stiff.
I-I would love to talk to you about, uh, that script.  I-I, you know, I think maybe that we could do something with it.
Oh, who cares?
Get a garter belt...  Get a garter belt and flirt.
...you don't have to think.
I'm on the track of a reward, which...
I'm going to tell you later....
Some museum director disappeared.
They're offering... 
<u>What</u> is this, a whorehouse, or are you my <u>wife</u>?
...I was <u>working</u>...
I <u>swear</u> to you...
Yes?  My <u>promotion</u>...?
You want me to solve all your problems tonight...?
And who is "they?"
...the whole world's out to get you...
Well, you wanna shoot <u>back</u>, it give you a big <u>target</u>...
Yes, but we know who it was, and I will tell you, Agent Starling, what you know to be true.  I offered the bounty.  It was illegal, and, worse, it was <u>wrong</u>. And I thank God every day that I did not compound my sinful life by the stain of a murder.  Do you  Agent Starling:  do you know <u>God</u>? 
No.  And...
...yes, if you'll, just step <u>away</u>...
Yes.  You know I will.  That's right.
I'm going to work for your reinstatement...
Well, you know <u>my</u> name, honey, but <i>I</i> don't know <u>yours</u>...
Hey, you know, I never thought of that...
Enchante.
Is it necessary to know?
Oh, no, no.  It won't be <u>that</u> long.
...but will that satisfy you?
It is not that I care for <u>you</u>--but that I posses an enquiring mind.  What will you <u>do</u> when I am gone?  When you have nothing to occupy your thoughts, save the memory of your own folly, and, more to the point, stupidity.
<u>Yes</u>.
Would that add to your <u>mirth</u>?
You're going to <u>do</u> that?
The Multi-Jurisdiction Task Force:  read alphabet soup, for the continued pursuit, and in preparation for the apprehension of the fugitive, Evelda Drumgo.  The man's hazing you.
I'll tell you what:  I should go in there, volunteer to fill up his Female Quota. 
Saying what, "Look out for a guy with ten fingers...?"
You stay offa this Alphabet Soup Detail, all this half-baked, cowboy stuff, till after you get your <u>mind</u> cleared.... you don't wanna go out there a half-step <u>slow</u>...
What do you want to do?  You want to jam up that sonofabitch Krendler.
What broke <u>you</u> free, Girl?
Yes, but the <u>important</u> thing, as I've said...
I'm sorry, I don't mean to be impolite. Because, you know, you can't understand.
Well, you know, you know, you know, the <u>point</u> is:  I <u>can't</u> tell you.  Cause you haven't <u>been</u> there.  You haven't <u>done it</u>. And that's all there <u>is</u>.
....that's right.
No.  That's right.  That's all part of it.
I don't <u>think</u> so.
I don't know.  Do <u>you</u> know...?
...no...
...no...
No, I don't <u>think</u> so...
...no.
Well, no...  That's... I appreciate your <u>help</u>, but... 
I have not, I would <u>not</u>.  For life  life goes on Starling.  And, wait, wait, I wish to <u>talk</u> to you... I'm...    One moment.  I was <u>afflicted</u>, do you see, but my affliction was not in my meeting with your Dr. Lechter.  I was <u>afflicted</u> before. Before.  Do you see?  In my arrogance. Do not  Do not curse God when you are humiliated.  Listen to me: <u>embrace</u> it, and you embrace <u>life</u>.... <u>Listen</u>, and you hear the word of <u>God</u>...
Was there a night that I got really drunk and declared that I never loved anyone as much as I loved you?
That's good. I wouldn't have wanted to embarrass myself.
Wha-at?  What is it?
You and Wichita go to school together, right?  Have you two ever...
That wants to be a Yes.
This is not the way it was supposed to-- I was going to start writing a children's book using input from all-- I don't even like smoking!

And you'll be happy to know I'm going to drop my Snow White and the Seventy Dwarves act...Not all of it, but...
I love you. Don't say I love you, too. I hate that--"love you, too."
Don't worry, you...
I'm just thinking I'm glad I broke up with everyone I ever went out with.  The swelling is gonna go down, right?
It's not my style, okay?
I don't know, it was okay, I guess.
Color me impressed. I thought you grew out of Betty Finn.
Lick it up, baby. Lick. It. Up.
Some teenybopper rag says Big Fun wants to play a Prom. It could be Westerburg's if we can get everyone's John Hancock.
Because I can be! The same fucking cheek, goddamnit! Why are you pulling my dick? Do you think, do you really think, if Betty Finn's fairy godmother made <u>her</u> Cool, she'd still act nice and hang with her dweebette friends? No way! Uh-Uh!
So did you call people to tell them how to get to the studio tonight?
You're welcome. It's a lot more interesting than just flinging off your clothes and boning away on the neighbor's swing set.
Stop kidding around. I'm going to have to send my S.A.T. scores to San Quentin instead of Stanford.
It's one thing to want somebody out of your life. It's another thing to serve them a wake-up cup of Drano.
So it looks like the person's been shot and killed when they're really just unconscious and bleeding.
Sure. Can we make an ice run before the funeral?
I don't get it! You were wrong! I was right! Strength, damnit! Come back!
I thought I...you..
Greate pate, but I'm going to have to motor if I want to be ready for the funeral tomorrow.
Stained with loserness. Oh, I like it. Can I use that. It'd be dynamite on interoffice memoranda.
Sure. Ciao.
Is it hurting, dear?
sighs.
grabs Pauline by the shoulders.
Oh, no . . . Mummy's awfully good at it.
Don't . . . please! Please, don't!
You're such an incredible woman.
I need my sodding parents' consent.
Let me see. Oh yeah. My head feels like it's going through a meat grinder. I'm not sure if I'm dreaming or...
Your insight is enlightening.
I understand, I think. Other women?
You were unfaithful, it sounds like your confessing.
I crap you not. She was all over me yesterday in the break room. And she was a total machine last night too.
Serious as a heart attack my friend. I think she literally fucked me brains out.
Zero's a number right?
How many zeros was your wife worth?
I'm... I'm doing a very special thing here. And you can't even ... respond?
It's perfect.
Seeing you were her sole benefactor, and I'm the executive of the will, Kirsty's entire estate would have to be donated to the city.
Pardon my glibness Trevor but you sound like a raving lunatic. The next time you seek counsel it should be of the psychiatric type. You're obviously on the verge of some nervous collapse.
What things do you think you've done?
The car accident? Any of this ringing a bell?
Nah, I fucked it up.  I was tryin' to impress this kid, don't ask me why.  I was gonna rescue his old man, but I couldn't find the poor bastard.  He musta blew up.  I got the hell outta there.  I didn't have the nerve to face the kid.
Try stupid.
You <u>woulda</u> gone in there, you wouldn'ta thought twice...  Trust me on that, that's the kinda guy you are.  For a guy like me, it's a momentary loss of sanity.  I wasn't thinking clearly.  Listen, I'm no hero, John.  I just want some dough and maybe a little favor. How much didja spend already on all that do-gooder bullshit?  You didn't spend it <u>all</u> didja?
Bernie.  Call me Bernie.
You mean John Bubber?
You are not gonna believe this, Evelyn!  Absolutely fantastic!  I'm on my way --
Ev, it's not my fault!  I'm trying to tell you this incredible --
Is he here, your friend.  The fireman?
Why doncha let me in so we don't wake everybody in the neighborhood?
I'm working on that.  It's just I got some business problems and... whatsa matter?
It's been sometime since, uh, I received any, uh, of that kind of, uh... attention.  A couple of... years.
Yeah, I got it.  Sports training. You learn to follow the ball.  How about you do a wrap-up from up here?  I'll pan off that skyscraper over there, find you here, then reveal the drop.
A "mystery guy!"  "Not a passenger." Who?
She can't quit.
An hour after...!  Deak, for Heaven's sake!  Let's give her a night in New York City.  We'll put her and her boyfriend up at a good hotel...
Okay.
Who doesn't?
Well, now, don't go creating some artificial environment for yourself.
It's not going to happen unless you make it happen, my friend. You're going to have to assert yourself a little bit more.  <u>Show</u> your affection.
<u>Ask</u> her how she feels.
You have to put yourself out there a bit more.
Because life isn't about playing it safe.  Life is about taking risks.
About us.
Yeah.  There's still a lot I want to do.  It's not quite... the kids aren't really settled in yet. Even the dog has been terribly high-strung and whines a lot since we've been here.  Look, he hasn't even come in for his food today.
No, I told you.  A whiff of perfume on his shirt.
I've asked him what's wrong.
The same thing -- his business pressures, the whole move and everything.  He's frantic about nailing this new job, worried about screwing over his present boss.
I've tried to get him to agree to one.  I just -- I don't know... I'm getting such weird vibes lately.
No, thanks, Mom -- I'll go up to bed now.
That's okay, Mom.
All new houses have noises.
One day before we know it it'll be an old house and we'll be old in it -- and I'll still be paying for it.
He's made some friends, hasn't he?
Did she water this plant?  It looks a little bent out of shape.
There's always an excuse, isn't there?
That's not a decision for you to make on your own.
Would you mind if Rudolf had a look too?
No.
What?  Who are you?  What do you want?
Talk to me about what?
I see your point, Bedsoe, but I have to look at this from the law's point of view.  There's something missing here.  It's something I'm sure you've come across many times in your career.  It's called evidence.  Get me a murder weapon with his fingerprints on it.  Find me an eye witness.  Dig up a motive.  Until then we don't have a case against him.
Most people are afraid of death.
That is what bothers me.
It's done.
Where do you go when your mind drifts?
The past?
Why is it you never talk to me about Scotland -- your life there.
I'll be fine.
Because it's my name.
I don't know anymore.
I've lived all over the world.
Get out.
It's not been long enough.  What witchcraft is this?
Aye -- that I would, lass.
I think he's dead!
<u>Fuck</u> them!  Now get your head in the game, Phil--we have to handle this.
You won't die if you let me help.
But if you stay in this house, I can promise you this --
You can't imagine the fucking you're going to get.
Jesus, first Mars, now you.  You two need anti-depressants.
Let me speak to Mr. Smith.  I want to hear it from him.
How about your two friends?  You don't have a man dying in there, do you?
Would you be in a hurry to go to prison for the rest of your life?
Maybe that's what I'm doing.  Can I reach in my pocket, show you something?
I got the gasoline --
Give me an ETA.
If you shoot me, he'll kill your daughter.  Do you want to lose both of them?
Shh, they'll hear you!
I don't see why you can't just lock me in.  It's not like I can go anywhere.
Chief Talley is the one who got you out.
Go.
You have her cell number?
They might be at the house.  Keep trying and let me know.  I'm going to be here a little while longer.
I'm looking for you.  I need your tactical unit.
Don't question me, Captain!  This is <u>my</u> crime scene!
Where's the office?
Who is it?
You want . . . Marlon and Al.
These disks . . . where are they?
I'll be back.
And four children?
Yes. Where are the Rwandan police?
That explains it. I'm sorry to tell you this but we've heard rumors the Militia are getting ready to storm the hotel.
I can't, I don't have the men.
You said you had no whiskey.
If you do not help me, you will stay on that list.
Who will tell them? You need me to tell how you helped the hotel. The others who have gone, they blame you for all their misfortune. They say you led the massacres.
You think they will believe you?
I will do nothing unless you help me now.
Oh my God!
For supplies, you drive.
Just drive, Gregoire.
Call, sir?
Rusesabagina. Paul Rusesabagina.
They will surely kill us here. It's over here. We have to take the chance.
Murdered! By whom?
No, Odette says he's in shock.
He needs to be in a safe place.  Have you heard from Mr. Garindi?
It's alright. This is the only place I can find some peace.
What sort of plan?
Please do not talk like this.
He has taken the presidential suite.
The staff, the guests.
Now we have eight hundred guests and one hundred staff. I have ten minutes left.
-- but nobody has yet, Donald. They just haven't been brought to that breaking point. They have to believe proof-positive that their lives are in danger.
But they didn't see it happen, they still have doubts. What we need is another body, and Steven's bloody hands right next to it!
Okay: this may sound crazy, but --
No. I'm going back to try and find Ms. Marr. If she's hurt, I'll tend to her. Dead, then I'm coming back for him.
I don't know!!
I'll stay, if it'll ease your mind.
Left, goddamnit!
And we get this money when?
Why?
Back where?
-- was that??
Eddie Moses, Communications Attache -- which translated from ancient bullshit means: I work for a Messenger service.
Must be getting old, Stevie -- you're repeating yourself -- this is the exact same set-up you used for the Son-Of-Sam Hunt back in '94.  Girlie, open up that casket there and see what you find.
No, no, it's just --
What?
Sorry, Pritchett, here you go.
-- I wouldn't worry, Ms. Jenzen: the unexplainable will probably explain herself before too long. In the meantime, let's all relax, have a drink, the evening's young --
Don't think so. Stay the fuck back.
Not even for a million dollars, Mr. Price.
Believe me, we need to.
The basement -- but, believe me, you don't want to go down there.
You'll never find it, it's a maze down there.
You say you saw some activity here?
No!
We'll have every leprechaun in Ireland here honey.
Go to your room!  Now!
It's dark!  I can't breathe!
You didn't think much about that before.
It was in the cellar.  Weird.
Aubrey!
I'm all right...
Yes, I am.
Come back to us honey!
So what does that have to do with Aubrey!  Where is she!
What are you getting at!
It was nailed to the cellar wall.
Runic?
You have to help me.  You will understand.  And no, you're not dreaming.  Do you know where we are?
Correct.  The fields of France.  And many dead flowers ... Oh.  Forgive me. My name was Spenser.  Elliott Spenser. Captain.
Where?
It's okay.  It's just someone burned me once.
Would you know this store again?
It's Saturday morning.  Let's go shopping.
Wow.  Thank you.
It has already begun.
I laughed, I cried.
Sure.  That's why his meatballs are made out of marinated Chuck Wagon.
5:32.  "Swinging on a Star."
Damn travel agency.  That Kremlin thing is in Moscow, isn't it?
I can't believe you didn't notice. My weight.  I lost ten pounds in Rome
As for our plan of action, anybody'd be insane to go in from the ground floor...
Forget about it--it was nothing-- anybody would have done the same thing--It's an impulse...
Excuse me, Milady.  I would have flown over and carried you up to a pink cloud, but I left my cape at the cleaners.
Uh....old badminton injury.
Uh, yeah.  Guess I'm a wee bit nervous.  I'm sorry I could only score clergy passports.
Or you cut off my thingie. Directions even your brother would understand.
Market crashes.  Bomb drops. Greenhouse effect affects.  We'll still be the richest, most powerful people in the world.  In 1992, Europe is coming together to become one business superpower.  It's one party we'd love to poop.
The only thing you can't do is get sex for free.  I know I was in prison for like basically the 80's, but, call me daffy, aren't you supposed to <u>stop</u> me from committing crimes.  You know, Book-em-Dano, Call-for-backup, Give-a-Hoot-Don't-Pollute.
Alchemy.
You just might.  I'm the guy who tricked you into robbing a government installation and then had you sent to prison for it.  At the time, I was bald with a beard, no moustache, and I had a different nose, so if you don't recognize me, I won't be offended.
The Circle-o'-Gaiety!
He didn't offer you money.
Ten dollars? Let's grab a highball!
Why yes, do you know it?
I know that, Amy.
I understand that you're not very skilled yet in the secretarial arts. I'm not that skilled as president. Oh sure, I put up a big front --  -- not that everyone's buying it.
Oh, I don't blame them, really. I guess I have sort of made a mess of things. These folks have to protect their investment. Most of them are very nice people --
Oh Norville, I --
Terrific.
Tell me about it.
I'm sure you do.
Well, I --
Aw, buddy, I don't care about that.
I haven't had --
Oh my God, sir!
Well... I'm for it...
He don't look wise.
Oh, Mrs. Rand --
I've never heard of a cure.
Fortunately, not.  This is my first experience with it as a physician. But I have seen half-witted field hands -- whom the other peasants call Zombies.  I am sure they suffer from a similar destruction of spinal nerves as the result of high fever.
It'll wait.
Jessica was never any good for Paul.  You will be, you are.  And Mother -- seeing Jessica day after day -- never able to escape, never able to forget.  Please, Betsy -- it's only merciful.
Good morning.
I have no defense.  So far as I know -- it is true.
How do you know I'm not?  I was cruel to Jessica.  When I got to know her -- when I found out how empty and ungenerous she was, there was something about her -- something smooth and false -- that made we want to hurt her.
No.  It's not just how I felt toward Jessica.  I've been cruel to even you.
No -- it's about Mrs. Holland.  A result of our discussion the other day, I'm afraid.
In view of all the circumstances, the commissioner has decided on a legal investigation.
Of the nature of Mrs. Holland's illness.  And, of course, the events which led up to it.
I did everything I could to forestall this, Paul.  I don't think there's any question of your innocence in the matter.  But there's been too much talk.  The thing's out of hand.
Clair, George Clair! What the hell brings you to New Canaan?
Well, hey, isn't that a one-in-a million coincidence. A real dreamer, Jim Williams, eh?
Don't see how. I think the public's had its fill of this gangster stuff. No, trust me -- disaster pics. And air hockey.
Oh. Sure, I -- Did you remember to pick up the cranberry sauce?
In the car.
Well, the whole gamut. Facts of life and all. Some fatherly advice, because, I tell you, there's things happening that you're probably old enough... well...  For example, on the self-abuse front -- now this is important - it's not advisable to do it in the shower -- it wastes water and electricity and because we all expect you to be doing it there in any case -- and, um, not onto the linen, and not on your sister's underwear or any clothing belonging to your mother --
What?
Jimmy? Jimmy? I don't know how to take this. And what do you mean, Jimmy? I thought you said you and your husband --
I just can't believe you could be so --
C'mon.
A key party?
Hi Wendy.
Social work?
Educated guess.
You don't have to apologize. I'm too much of a cynic. You actually seem to be trying to figure things out -- don't mind me.
Man, Francis, you are one drug addled elitist freak, and when the revolution comes I do not want to be lined up with you and shot, 'cause you're fucking ripe for political reeducation, you know, like in the fields.
I gotta get to English class.
Let's see!
Who said so?
I don't have a girlfriend.
Wendy!
What are you doing?
Mike's out -- I think he went to Silver Meadow to see if you were hanging around there.
Are you his girlfriend?
What's that, then?
But they're so boring.  All small stuff.
About an hour ago.  Said he was more than happy to cooperate.
What time was that?
Mrs. Connell found this copy in the house.  It's signed.  Personally.
This is a local writer.  Kay had all his books.  I think we should check it out.
You know I remember that.
Maybe not.  We could talk to Buck...
Cut some kind of a deal.  I heard that's what Flynn's doing...
There've been other cases.  Where we've changed results.  Pushed witnesses. Manipulated evidence.  But Dobbs.  I wanted Dobbs more than anything.
Thought you wanted something fun...
Yes.
Yes.
I gave her things she didn't have. Couldn't have.
Yes, and very beautiful.
They did, but too fast for you to see them. No magic, just grace and speed.
Your lover.
If you say so. You are innocent.
She is.
I could give you reasons. Her silence. Her youth. It's forbidden to make so young, so helpless, that cannot survive on its own.
Did you kill this vampire who made you both? Is that why you won't say his name? Santiago thinks you did.
It's already begun. If you want to save her, send her away.
Yes, cherie, of course you want more. And I'll show you how to get it. You drink from morals, my beauty, but from me? Never again.
Drunk on brandy wine. A thimblefull. I thought of you when I saw them.
And it means something else too, doesn't it? I shall never, ever grow up.
Tell me you don't hate me Louis. I did it for you -
Yes. Should I take her, Louis? Among her dolls? make a doll of her in turn?
Never.
That's not so.
So you felt it too!
They are gone, Louis. Death took them. Death which you can now destroy...
The crucifix -
But how do you know?
I can't.
I like to do it. I enjoy it. Take you aesthete's taste to purer things. Kill them swiftly if you will, but do it! For now doubt, you are a killer Louis. Ah!
That's enough, cherie. Stop before the heart stops.
I tried...
You have it...
How could I not? She had to know.
Where would she have gone? She was a child, and beautiful, heartbreaking merciless child. And I had made her that...
My daughter...
Not possible, I'm afraid. The last ferry left hours ago. And we got a storm coming. There won't be another one for days.
What are you doing in my closet?
Hey, sorry...  He's my friend, too. And that ticket is not going to waste.
Hey, slow down, turn off the little motor up in there...What do you say we go to the gym and work off a little stress?
I've got to see.
It's not like that. It's not you. It's me. My head. I want to go back. I want to be with you. I want to be fine. I want everything to be like it used to be.  It just isn't.
Fine. Show me the body.
What if I don't have anything happy from childhood...Sorry, I can't relax going five hundred miles an hour, or four thousand, four hundred feet a minute...  Which is over seven hundred feet a second. Imagine hitting something at seven hundred feet a second.
Fumes build up in the fuel tanks. You can by surface-to-air missiles over the internet. Planes use O-rings...which freeze in tap water. Planes fall from the sky for practically no reason at all.
Right. Planes get hit by lightning. They get hit by meteors. They hit other planes.
Me, me, me. It's always about you. I'm having bad dreams. I can't sleep. I'm not doing well in school. I'm having trouble with my boyfriend.
We had a connection, didn't we? I can tell you one thing, though. Ray didn't trust me. He was right. He's dead, but he was right.
They all start to look the same once you've worked in one.  Am I right, sister?
Yeah, a great weekend. Forget the weather!
I'm not waiting...So give me the gun and keep the ring.
They're all dead...Dead, I tell you.  Ahhhh, we're all deaaaddddd. Tyrellll, joinnnn usss.
You collect these to sell, abroad?
I have lived long enough to doubt everything -- which is to say, I believe everything, a little.
We will know when the next one sickens.  Until then you and I remain here. I will not bring the plague to my troops.
I think she went to bed  I saw her going toward the house
How kind you are. It is so comforting to know that someone cares.
That should decide it or you --
Yes?
I don't understand you.
If you should fall sick we'll be careful. You need not worry.
You ask that of me? You're afraid to live in your coffin. You know what that means?
Never fear -- when you are dead you will remain dead. I will see to it that you do not walk about again. I promise you that. There is another one here who can not die. I will watch you both. Never fear.
Oh, now  now look here 
But that should make you like her.
She was born before your wife returned here to die. You never knew.
Then foreclose!
Don't . . . George?
Your lip's stopped bleeding, too, George.
No, of course not.
Don't you understand, George? It's because you were not born.
You're nobody. You have no identity.
If you ever get your wings, you'll see all by yourself.
It was his faith and devotion that are responsible for this organization.
Mother . . .
Hee-haw!
I'm all right.
Oh, George.
Oh, now, Pop, I couldn't. I couldn't face being cooped up for the rest of my life in a shabby little office.
She was here first.
Got to see Pop, Uncle Billy.
It's important.
Get a tray for these great big important simoleons.
Have you notified the police?
Neither am I.
I'm going to scream!
That does it  come here.
Mary! Let me touch you! Oh, you're real!
You have no idea what's happened to me.
With butter, if they got any....
Stop paddling!
I was counting on hours.
The Shark.
Anyone got another set of sails?
Could you just keep that crowd back, please?
Goddamnit, Hendricks, untie the rope there.
Not till next year.
Sorry, I'm all booked up...  Come, m'dear.
We don't know that, do we?
You don't tell me my job, and I won't tell you about yours, okay?
MMMmmmorning....
Oh, perfect -- a 75 per cent family affair.  Where were you?
Mike's out there.
Brody?  This is Patrol Base.
Now I really want to see it.
Sure.  They like to play.  We may see some today.
Huh?
Figure they split?
Name it.
You always go with Andy.
He thought he had a good reason.
Can't help you, Mike.  Don't have the manpower.
I know, but you're just going to have to find another way.  So you better start.
Don't let him get you.  Just continue your patterns and pretend he's not around.
Honey, I gotta go.
... Electrical connection malfunctioning.
That we swim.
Michael, the sub's dead.
Okay, stay.  We'll come back for you.
It's easier to lure sharks at night.
Hydrophobia...
I have to get out of here.
I can't take water, Kathryn.
I can't!  My dad had it, and I don't know if you can inherit it or what, but I got it, and I hate it.  I can't stand it!
I'm  fine.
Afraid I can't do that.
Look, Doctor, this isn't one of your pet porpoises we're after. It's a torpedo of muscle. Murderous expertise!  I've seen bleeding sharks try to eat themselves!  Don't be so concerned about them.  Worry about yourself.
She, Mister Hutton.
Someone's looking for you.
I don't know, what else is there?
The one that goes underwater?
No, Kelly, I don't want to...
Not for me.  I don't go in the water, remember?
No, think of something else.
I'm not acting!  I don't want to go in it, okay?
Ohhhhh shhhhiiiit.
Five hundred yards.
Last week he broke up a major counterfeiting ring.  Gang of kids were using slugs in the Pac-Man games.
Booked them all at Baskin- Robbins.
Watch me, Grandma....
Please, Mom.  At least consider it. You should get away.  You shouldn't be alone now....
I don't know...You...I don't know.
Do you and Michael ever talk about his work...?  About spending so much time working in the water?
I can't help it....
I shouldn't interfere...  My mother-in-law is so neat she puts paper under the cuckoo clock....
You caught me....
What difference does it make?  It's here....
He heard that.
You're silly....
What?
Come on, Mom, you can't be serious....
I'm just getting started....
Once he locked himself in the bathroom and your grandfather had to get the ladder and climb in through the window....
No.
Doesn't matter....
You're not going to bet it all....
No!
Yes you can....
You got a better idea...?
What's that....?
Feathers all over the place....
Forget it....
They put bombs on dolphins....
We don't write up anything until we're done....
When we got the grant....
When I signed on....
We got it together, Jake....
We have at least three months' work left.  We can't write a report...We don't know enough....
My name goes on that report.  It's a half-assed job, I don't get my doctorate.  Neither do you....
Maybe the gear crapped out....
Maybe it's gone....
Anybody ever tell you you're nuts....
When he has a pillow over his head....
"Welcome to Eureka."
O.K.
Not too good in daylight ..
I think I got something - twenty two years old, dark hair - study- ing mathematics -  - Last seen <u>5 weeks ago</u> ..
All but .. How <u>you</u> doing?
I wish he'd tell that to Citrine.
<u>I'm sick of this toy town shit</u>.
Don't give me that! <u>Not another</u> <u>word</u>! When you had the Fat Lady in there, and I asked you if she was lying, you looked me right in the eyes and said <u>yes</u>. So as far as I was concerned, <u>she's ly-</u> <u>ing</u>. And if the King of fucking England had walked in & told me different, I wouldn't have bel- ieved him - because <u>you</u> told me ..
<u>Hit those wipers, Ross</u>.
Coz this is a major & we're closer to this bastard than anyone's ever been.
He <u>hasn't</u> hidden it. He never made a hit this far north before, and he never read a weather forecast .. She's probably fifteen feet from the highway, three feet under snow.
No.
No, Sir.
It's <u>her</u> hand. <u>Her</u> scars. <u>Her</u> dog. Her dog's shot. And she's missing.
If you're not gonna hear me, Chief ..
We have a multiple homicide, Sir ..
No .. But we have a theory ..
Maybe he's lying to you?
As she's a member of my staff, may I ask what this is about?
I see .. Well, she's teaching an- other class at four .. I'd apprec- iate it if you don't detain her ..
I gotta admit, you're one of them. Just wish I knew what you meant by a "hollow car?"
I know.
Coz you hardly said a word since you got here. But you been thinking pretty loud ..
I been told to take your car in, Sir.
I dunno, Sir. Brought you up a Chevy.
I'm here, honey. I'm right here.
No one's gonna make that Gent. Six months investigation, & the nearest we got, we thought he was a sailor.
Ask him.
Jerry!  Do something --
You know I didn't ever want to hurt you.
Then you shouldn't have begged me to hire him.
Absolutely.
He's asleep.  Watch out for that lamp.
Sorry about this hand.  You know that feeling -- you're not completely embarrassed yet, but you glimpe tomorrow's embarrassment?
Oh shit.  You said "boss."
Now I feel like Clarence Thomas.
No, I do.  I feel like Clarence Thomas.  I'm like... harrassing you... right now.
Good night.
What --
Tell me -- let me help --
Well -- I'm not the guy who's going to run.  I stick.
You want...
...my soul or something. _ 117.
No kidding.  I looked over and saw the shadow of two curious shoes in the doorway of the kitchen.
Thank you.
We decided to stay with you.
Mmm.  Hmm.
Yes.
Well, boo-fucking-hoo.
No.
Forget it.  Forget it.
I'm a little worried --
Jerry Maguire.  SMI.
Well.  Good luck with that --
And say what?  "Please remove your dick from my ass?!"
You did this to yourself.  You said "fewer clients."  You put it all on paper.  Scully was very upset.  Heart attacks make some people sweeter, but not him.  You did this to yourself --
Funny.
Quiet!
A friend. We were vacationing. Eric wanted to see the island and the dinosaurs, so Ben found a guy who would take them parasailing. They never came back.
We have to help him.
You mean it?
I know. I know. I want to look for him too.
They're here.
Some of the worst things imaginable have been done with the best intentions. You rushed in with no thought to the consequences, to yourself or anyone else.  You're no better than the people who built this place.
In Costa Rica?
No. Although I've studied them in the wild.
No, no, see Dr. Grant, you're the best. You've seen these animals in the flesh. No one else has come close to you.
Well, we don't exactly have a Costa Rican phone book here, so it will have to be somebody we know in the states. Someone we can absolutely count on to send help.
Because I didn't know!  I don't have the faintest idea what they're doing here.
Everyone, keep your voices down!
Where does it say that?
I hadn't planned on bringing carnivores back because of the liability risk, but I only thought of adults, it never occurred to me --  You are a billion dollar idea, my little f-
Let it go, Peter.  The animal won.
Our chance to do what?
Look, we have two choices.  We can hike back down to the lagoon, where we can sit for two days, in the open, next to a heavily used water source while we're waiting for your boat to arrive, or we can head for the village, where we might find some shelter and we can call for help.
It has to be temporary, something that'll break apart and fall off as the animal grows...
Ian, if we recall the boat now, we've made two invasive landings in one day.  That'll have to go in any paper I write, and it will leave room for people to say our findings were contaminated.  You know the academic world as well as I do, once they smell blood in the water, you're dead.  Our presence has got to be one hundred percent antiseptic.  That means if we bend a blade of grass, we bend it right back the way it-
You go if you like, but we're not waiting for you.  MOVE IT OUT!!
Where did the vehicles stop?
Mr Nedry, Mr Nedry.  The embryos have to be back here in San Jose by then.
I was wondering, how are you planning to beat the security?
I'm sorry for the dramatic entrance, but I'm in a hurry. Will you have a wee bit of a drink now and then?
Why?
Look.
They were wrong.  Case closed.  This thing doesn't live in a swamp to support it's body weight for God's sake!
- - like birds.  What happen is, they swallow the stones and hold them in a muscular sack in their stomachs - -
- - which is called a gizzard, and it helps them mash their food, but what happens after a while - -
- - barfs them up - -
And when she swallows the stones, she swallows the poison berries too.  That's what makes her sick.  Good work Tim.
What's that?
I get ah - -
And scary.
When people try to control things that it's out of their power - -
Anti-nature.
Hola, bienvenido
Donald, this park was not built to carter only to the super rich.  Everyone in the world's got a right to enjoy these animals.
Yes it is.
No.
This is impossible.  How am I going...I can't make it. This is...it's about fifty feet.
What if the car falls?  What if the wheels fall?
You're crazy!  I'm not gonna jump!
When you gotta go, you gotta go.
Alan Grant.  Tell me, what kind of metabolism do they have?  What's their growth rate?  rate of growth.
No, I didn't hear anything.  No, we're okay.
Timmy, let go!  You're gonna have to let go!  Count to three.  I'll catch you.
You're all right, John You're okay.  It's just you don't have intelligence.  You have "thinktelligence."  You think narrowly and call it "being focused."  You don't see the consequences.  You're very good at solving problems, at getting answers - - but you just don't know the right questions.
Why did you do this?
Fifty? We need seventy-five.
I really think we should go back...
Some kind of emergency back at the Sheriff's Station. Four deputies shot... some kind of explosion... I don't know what's going on, but they're panicking back there.
Video store?
None of that's true?
So, what are you saying... that he didn't kill all those people?
That's right. The murders in the eighties were never solved.  But... there were teenaged witnesses who said Krueger had the ability to appear in your dreams... and that if he killed you in a dream, it would kill you in the real world.
Don't you see? Jason was _asleep_. And he was dreaming -- the REM patterns prove that. And I saw finger blades just like Krueger's come out of Jason's chest. There has to be a connection.
I don't know... but I think he's pissed.
Krueger's the greater danger right now. We have to stop him.  _Springwood_. That's where he'll go. That's where he's always gone. But Springwood's not like Crystal Lake. There's a couple hundred thousand people there. He could be anywhere.
What is it really?
Well, as long as I admire it from afar it shouldn't worry me if it's hollow.
-- In what sense?
Burgel, I thought it would be easier, as long as I was passing --
Your credibility -- yes, it's well known.
I'll commit that to memory.
Excuse me, I have to copy this for Central Docketing by 2:30.
They're ubiquitous.  What we try to do ... is make them a little less so.
First these nameless authorities were the root of all evil, now it's insignificant Burgel.  If indeed there was a mistake -- and a minor one at that -- you're suggesting someone went to a lot of trouble over something so trivial as to not matter at all.
Now Burgel's one of the authorities?
What did she say?
When a scapegoat is needed, my friend ...
What have you done with Gabriela Rossmann?
We used to be in the supply section, carrying boxes of medicine about but we dropped too many of them.
Kong is a myth, nothing but a native superstition, Miss Darrow. All we're going to find on that island are some primitive people in grass skirts. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm trying to reduce my handicap.
Now now, Ann! Try be to polite.
Leave it, Ann.
We should never have come! I pay you good money, only to have my life endangered. You'll be hearing from my lawyer!
) They are now.
Yeah.
Coz of something I lost.
Compassion.
No.
Look -- could I use your phone?
Look. I almost killed my -- I almost killed someone.
Tom Grunemann. He wrote you some letters.
He was a research engineer at the Tuscarora Laboratories in Pennsylvania. He disappeared from there last April. I've been hired to look for him.
You know what I'm talking about. Miss Daniel.
Will you let me ask you some questions?
-- OK --
You told me what you could. I guess I'm through with your part of it.
I don't see anything, do you?
Try some other ways. 
And I don't think that was Tom.
No, I said what did you think.
Well --
Yeah, you got to me.
Oh. No. Not that way. I'd say it was more -- I don't know --  -- too bad? Pathetic?
We did this before.
I don't like getting splashed.
With Trina.
Maybe I wasn't there when you called.
How do you know how bad it was?
Because I didn't want to be touched! I didn't think you'd get that!
It's where it doesn't get me. I've got nothing left that connects to anything.
I better keep looking.
I could try Arlyn Page again. She saw much more of the Dumper than Bree Daniel.
It's got to make sense some way.
Two years ago? Sorry.
Look -- dad -- I may stand better with the cops than you.
I don't know. It looks familiar to me.
Doctor, I attempt to conduct my social life discreetly.  At the moment I am seeing no one.
Not particularly.
The prospect of losing my child.
Wow!  French toast, really?
In a minute...
Yeah?
That's okay, pal.  Go back to sleep.  It's very late.
Sure.  Lots of times.
Overruled.  The witness will answer, please.
Your honor, I would request a direct answer to a direct question.  Does she have a lover?
What?!  What do you mean, I don't understand.
Look, you don't understand.  I need a job.  I've got a kid and--
Okay, okay...What is it this time? What did I do now?...
Joanna, whatever it is, believe me, I'm sorry.
Now listen, before you do something you'll really regret you'd better stop and think--
Ted, if you can't discuss this rationally--
Me?  I've never been better. I mean having my wife walk out on me after seven years of marriage agrees with me just fine.
I'm going to be okay.  The way I see it, Joanna'll come home, it's just a matter of time.
Kramer...
First, there's no such thing as an open and shut case. Especially where custody is involved.  Got it?
She's the mother.  That means she's within her legal rights.
Got it.
I understand.
I'm sure.
Ted, I just heard...
It is alright, Father.
Soon.
Far, far away.
Please.
Eight thousand, five hundred, soldiers and officers. We have recently requested mortars, anti-aircraft guns and ammunition from India. We have several hundred in the area.
Non-violence means co-operation when it is possible. Resistance, when it is not.
Is he a bad man? Norbu says he is "lavish" and "willful". "How can he give you monk's vows if he has not kept them himself?"
He was always nice to me. He found me. He saw me in his dreams.
The Chinese.
But, surely, we are safe in Tibet. We don't believe in killing.
It is possible, Holiness.
Completely.
Well, he was very ill and he refused to go see a doctor and well... I think he had Alzheimer's, he would be coherent one day, incoherent the next and one <u>coherent</u> day, he asked me to end his suffering.  I wouldn't <u>do</u> it but he kept insisting and insisting and deteriorating till the point the only cognitive thing he could really do was that I finish him off.  Finally I just gave in and hit him on the head with a skillet then buried him under the bulkhead.
<u>No</u>.  If you don't kill him instantly, I'm dead and you'll only kill him instantly if you get his brain, which is about the size of a cherry.  And even if you <u>were</u> on target, a bullet might not penetrate his hide.
What the hell are you doing?!!
You're crawling around like a--
A spring trap!
I coulda shot you, you--
Is everything a big fucking joke to you?
I have enough flaxedil with me to put him out.  And I think I know a way to--
Look.  I know I'm crazy, but when they come, they will kill it.  They have to, politically, he's too dangerous, if something were to go wrong... the odds are he will be destroyed,--
You talk to Bickerman?
Women's intuition.  Are there anymore?
You think I'm <u>that</u> nuts?
Nothing's real.
<u>Nothing's</u> real.  I'm rich, people are automatically my friends, sycophants ooze out like oil slicks and and and--
Yes, it <u>did</u> seem prehistoric but I'm sure he just carried the thing for luck.  Not that it <u>worked</u>, obviously.  It probably somehow got lodged into his body.
I'd be able to see something.
Excuse me?
What are you talking about?
Gee, that was so poetic, Jack.  I'm all moist.
Nice?  Nice would be "you look pretty," nice is not some man- eating monster has tricked my brain into making you look good.
You <u>did</u>, you--
A man just died, you're hitting on me with science.
Maybe.  Don't mush it.
You're mushing it a little around the--
Take him.
Good thinking.
Where is he?!
It's just that--
I asked you to be nice to him.
She's worried about the cow now.
A jerk.
It's ten after nine.
Pleading with a crazy man, with come all over my face.
I will... I promise.
Yes sir. I can find it by myself.
I think we may be, yes.
You haven't said a word today about that garage. Or what I found there.
You knew. You knew from the start that Lecter held the key to this... But you weren't up front with me. You sent me in to him naked.
He starts this - buzzing in me, in my head. He makes me feel violated... You used me, Mr. Crawford.
You heard them. I don't have that authority anymore.
"We" being the Behavioral Science Unit, at Quantico. You're one of Jack Crawford's, I expect.
May I see your credentials?
That's just part of the island. It has a very nice beach. Terns nest there.
Yes...! They were screaming.
No. First I tried to free them... I opened the gate of their pen - but they wouldn't run. They just stood there, confused. They wouldn't run...
I took one lamb. And I ran away, as fast as I could...
I doubt very much that the FBI or any other government agency can keep a secret, Mr. Crawford. Truth will out... And then what? Will you give Johns Hopkins a new identity? Put a big pair of sunglasses on this building, and a funny nose?
It may be that - I could confer with my colleagues on this. And get back to you.
Can we rest soon?
Miss.  May I?
Winter with the Delaware, my father's cousins. And in the spring, cross the Ohio and look for land to settle with my father in a new place called Can-tuck-ee.
I am sorry, Duncan...
Ottawa!
A French & Indian army out of Fort Carillon's heading south to war against the English. I'm here to raise this county's militia to aid the British defense.
We'll see in the morning...
That's all, sir.
Terrible feature of war in the Americas.  Best to keep your sight fixed on our duty.
Yes sir!
And this?
Pretty good imitation of a hangover and I ought to know.
Uh, oh...I see where this is going...
No!
Fuck your orders!
Why?  You going to give me hard time like the others?
Good...It's going good.
I can't see them!
Roger.
It shouldn't be a long delay.
Twelve hours, no big deal.  We should know something first thing in the morning.  Don't worry.
Aw, loosen up, Bowman...  Hey, Willie, I got one served up for you.
What music?  There ain't no music.
He's tanking on us...
Two hundred meters.
Honey, the company don't give a flying fuck about "whys," they just look at the numbers and the contract says if we miss our quota they only got to pay us half-pay for the entire month.
How many times I got to tell you.  I saw a ship.
I am not sure what's more worrying, the job or your past.
I'll think of something, don't worry.
A cocktail, you asked for a cocktail.
You want a pint, go to the pub.
It's a Samoan pub.
You ask him if you like, but I would leave him to it if I was you.
Oh, you must be the brains then. That's right, guns that fire shot . . . Make sure you bring everything from inside the gun cabinet. There will be a load of guns, that's all I want. I'll pay you when you deliver. Everything outside the cabinet you can keep; it's yours.
It's a fucking stately home, of course there'll be something there.
Made a few quid, did ya? Now where is it?
This is dangerous shit, Dean; we don't even know who lives in there.
Furry muff, let's go.
Just give me the keys.
Well that depends on how you look at it. I can afford it as long as I see it again, if that's what you mean. You got the rest from the fat man and Bacon?
Tom, go and throw those guns off a bridge.
. . . What?
It's Ed, if that's what you mean.
I wanted to talk to you about that.
Range? I don't want to blow the arse out of this country, granted, but I don't want anybody blowing a raspberry at me either. I want to look fucking mean.
All right, let's forget about them for the time being. What about your weed man?
I would take a pain in the arse for half a million.
Tom, the fatter you get, the sadder you get.
I can't take any more school.
So?
They're not going to jail.
Just some rich Anglo out on the lake. Don't even live here all year.
They stole our land--
He'll live.
Jimmy got a kitchen full of wetbacks, most of 'em relatives. People breed like chickens.
I roust some muchacho on the street, doesn't have his papers, all he got to say is "Yo trabajo para Jimmy Herrera."
Your mother got a brother--Alphonse--
Otis stood on good terms with the man. Whenever you do something makes the news, he sends it on. When they made you General, Otis just about drove away all our customers going on about it.
Yeah, I know--Man made me memorize the whole damn Army chain of command before he'd marry me. So this is a big deal, commander and  all?
Otis went on like you were that guy who won the Gulf War. Colin whatsit.
He never asked her.
I finished that. I'm just messing around.
You got to be in the Army, you might as well have something slick to drive.
We had a kid pass out in the men's room. The town isn't much.
Pleased to meet you.
We have an enlisted man's club at the post.
That's right.
The Army hands you a command, you go wherever it is.
I hear things, too.  People call you the Mayor of Darktown.
And people make their choice--
En ingles Enrique. This is the United States. We speak English.
Good night, Enrique. She slides into the car--
King wasn't Mexican, Fenton--
We need a drug rehab program, we need a new elementary school--
There's no call for that, Sam. Fella made himself a pile of enemies over the years.
We got that dedication tomorrow. This is a hell of a time to be draggin' up old business.
And I understand why you might want to think he could.
Look, I'm not gonna campaign against your deal here, but if anybody asks me, I got to tell them the truth. We-- don't--need--a new jail.
He ever accept cash for a favor?
Out in the fresh air, nice gringo lady making you pies--who's gonna sit back in a little jail cell all day? Sheriff Buddy, man. Como el no hay dos. And after that cabron Charley Wade--
He murdered Eladio Cruz. That tough enough for you?
Chucho Montoya saw it with his own eyes. Shot him in cold blood.
Pilar--
The shooter local?
Okay--we'll take a statement from all the GIs before they go back to post. You can get the story from Otis over at the club.
Nothin' much. The Rangers put Ben Wetzel on it. Catch you later.
You sell much out here?
Hell of a spot to put a business.
Have a nice evening, Mr. D'Amour.
Hey, anytime.  Actually, no.  This was enough.
What do you mean, "all of us?"
About?
What about death?
Please... Butterfield... I wasn't there.  Ask Pimm.
You haven't seen anything yet.
No it isn't.  You can't help me.
I'm here, Harry.
Yes.
Sure.  You want me to find out about Quaid?  I mean, the funeral?
Evil.  He was evil.  Come on.
Yeah, I know.
What?
Yeah.  You could say that.
Not much.
It's me betrayed him.
I don't know what else to do.
Yes?
I don't know.
Why would I want to?
Not true.
No.
But the first time I saw you was in the elevator.
Yeah, you don't remember?
We should get you to the doctor.
Yeah, look at that thing.
I know. But, it doesn't last, you have to go back sometime.
I don't know, it just doesn't, reality changes things....we can't stay here forever, unless maybe we started a Jazz band.
Bob?
Is this a bad time?
It's really hard to reach you... Did you get the carpet samples? I like the burgundy.
It's just carpet.
What are you talking about?
Is there anything I can do?
What?
Alright?
Fine.
Why don't you just stay there, and you can have it everyday.
I have to go, Adam's tormenting Zoe, I'll talk to you later. Are you going to be Ok?
Ok. Maybe I'll walk down with you.
Sure.
Oh... that's nothing, someone gave it to me.
I'm not. It's just corny, but I'm not into it.
Sorry if I have the worst B.O., I've been sweating in this little room with T.V. lights for hours...
Forgot my car keys.  What are you doing on the fourth floor?
Well, it's a nice surprise.  Should I hit the "stop" button?
You really had me going, Claire.  I was finally ready to propose to you.
Of course not.  They put him through severe mental stress.  Causing this aneurysm.
You know how I feel.  The world is random.  The only certainty I believe in is death.
...art sank, sun set, ark sank again...
I cranked it all the way up.  Nothing but hum.
And if what you're saying is true, what would happen to me?
I don't know.  Probably have a copy of my birth certificate...my apartment.
And what's that mean?
Suit yourself.  But does this mean anything to you?
So you can see where you're going when you crawl up his asshole.
I'm lucky I found it.  Someone put your box of dresses under a pile of rags in the garbage.
Need any help?
Thanks, sweetheart.
This time get your feet set.
Uh-huh.
No one's forcing her.
I was just playing ball.
Didn't have to try very hard.
It's this big hole.  You could almost see bone.
Uh huh.
Who said I'm not getting recruited?
It was on my bed when I came in.  Can you just...?
Right here.
Hey, what's up.
Yeah, sorry about that.  I had this meeting with this guy.
I'm alright.  But you can sit.
Yup.
A lot of things.  All I know is I'll be back in six months.
Not for Quincy McCall.
What?
you woke me up to tell me that?
Just you and Quincy, baby.  I got a meeting.
Business folks.
Nona, don't start bitching.  I got maybe two years left to play.  I'm just trying to put some things together for us.
Twenty-seven points, eleven assists and still undefeated.
Yup.
No, you need to hear me say it, I'll say it.  It's not true.
These adults are tough enough, I think you'll be surprised -- the Mexican's a bit of a question mark --
No.  No.
Ok.  Claudia Wilson: You tryin' to go deaf?
Did you hear what I said?
-- listenin' to that music so loud: You Tryin' To Damage Your Ears?
Well if you keep listenin' to the music that loud you're not only gonna damage your ears but your neighbors ears.
And that could be the sign of a damaged ear drum, you understand?
You got the TV on too, keep those on at that same time usually?
We were just gettin' warmed up. We were just getting started.
If you're not here for a 422 --
I'm sorry.
Yes.  I will.  It was nice to meet you Officer Jim.
yeah, good, ok.
Good bye.
Yes.
Claudia.
If he hadn't pissed his pants, we woulda won.  We fucking had this game.
What's up?
He's doing the interview with the lady --
What happend?
Yes they do, they do, but I'll make my dreams come true, you see?  I will.
I used to be smart but now I'm just stupid.
You were gonna ask me weren't you?
No.
No.
Graduation?
Twelve.
-- fuck you.
I don't think, he can't...
What the fuck is this, Jimmy?
Did your wife find out?
Then what?
-- that you shouldn't have done? That you regret, what? This? What's this? Fuck, man, c'mon.  Treat me like an asshole, but treat me like an <u>asshole</u>.
It's okay, Stanley. It's alright.
Did you ever touch her?
When they want us done, they'll call in the Harvard S.W.A.T team or some shit.
....it's alright....
-- the fuck are you talking about?
I'm fine. I'm fine, I just wanna keep playing --
No, stay back!  Stay back!
He is your brother!
Soon enough.  Here we are.
He's threatened to do it, it's been building up in him for months.
Come now, Athos, if Porthos is determined to end his life, then he will certainly manage to find the opportunity.
I will need you all.  All for one. One for all.
Jesus of Nazareth found the holy among the profane.  If we are to have a place of private prayer, where better than here, beside the channels where the shit and the garbage run to the river?
So was Mary Magdalene, and our Lord loved her.
You are right.  But it is a trap.
If the young woman truly loves Raoul --
It is something I have done -- or did not do.
I did not share beauty with someone... who is no longer here for me to share beauty with.
Phillippe.  Rest now.
... You knew you had a double?
What was the end page?
That food has spoiled.  That is why it was not shipped to the army.
What... an excellent idea, your Majesty!
Yeah?
we've got kidnapping, grand theft auto, burglary, and two counts of murder on you, and I'm gonna see to it personally that it sticks!
These crowds are going to make it a bitch!
She stole my car!!
Could explain why Fleming was there.
No.
This is Tubbs. Sorry I can't answer the phone, I'm out square dancing. Leave a message--
How about Marvosa and the others?
Well, you saved me from a bad situation. Thanks.  I admit this is...unusual.
Are you serious?  My boyfriend ditched me...
We were fighting - I told him to let me out.  So where are you headed?
The usual motivation doesn't apply to him, nor the way he uses them.  I don't have an answer for you.  Listen to me, my friend: leave this.
How are Molly and the boy?
Will Graham, Jack Crawford...
Read it.
That's it. Lecktor called him a Pilgrim when he was talking to me...
I know...
Will, Bowman just broke the code. It was a James Beard cook book. You need to know what it says right now.
I'll tell you in a second. Now listen to me: everything is okay, I'm taking care of it, so stay on the phone when I tell you.
It says: 'Graham home, 3860 DeSoto Highway, Marathon, Florida. Save yourself. Kill them all.  It's your home address, Will. The bastard gave him your home address.
Wait, Will...
I'll pick you up in...
Is there a label on the Jacobi can that says what lab processed it?
He went to the men's room.
You know you speak very well, although you avoid fricatives and sibilants in your speech. At the Riker Institute for the Blind. I trained in speech therapy for speech and hearing impaired children...
The Tooth...
Yes.
Uh... sure...
The report didn't mention nails and eyes.
Mrs. Leeds was a good-looking woman. I'd want to touch her skin in an intimate situation, wouldn't you?
Yes. 'Intimate.' They had privacy.  Everybody else was dead.
You didn't do it to me, Will; it's happened to us.  And if I survive the wallpaper we'll be okay...  He's after you now, isn't he?
Well, how you doin', Mr. Graham?! You sure are in the center of a storm. Burning up lots of taxpayer's dollars, too, I bet.  On the news they said he was a white man. He isn't really, is he?
You going back down to Florida after?
My grandboy's been eatin' a ton of breakfast every day. Been out riding. Must be the good air. You oughta see that little booger eat.  I'll bet he's gained ten pounds.  Molly's out in the motor home...
What's that?
I keep getting it for Christmas.
...commercially prohibited.  Number Twelve shot in liquid Teflon in a copper casing. On impact it all opens up in the target. Expect the recoil. They're hot loads.  Body armor?
I hope you have a second chance...
You got it.
Of course!  That's what negotiations are for.
Oh no!  Did he get hurt?
Andy, they don't think you suck. They've just... lost a reason to love you.
Eh, I dunno... Andy.  I'm... thinkin' of letting you go...
Look -- I don't wanna seem insulting.  But... your act is like amateur hour: Singalongs... puppets... playing records...
Okay, great!  So let's reset!
Gosh.  Gee, Lynne... I was just so impressed with your wrestling moves. EXT. MOVIE THEATER - DAY
I can shtop whenever I want...
Oh George, this is Bob Zmuda.  Bob and I have been buddies for years.
I dunno.  If they were, they'd be pushin' 80.
And you say, "Santa, what am I gettin' for Christmas?"  And he says, "Cancer!"
Why's that?  You said over and over and over, Tony Clifton is not Andy Kaufman --
Sure it is.  Tony called me himself. He yelled at me, insisting that his dressing room be bigger than Andy's. They're both going on tonight, believe me!
I used to think you were original.
What's your name?
"Bob"?  BOB!  Bob bob bob.  Bob what?
"Gorsky"?  What is that, Polish?
No, Lieutenant, your men are already dead.
I know but I felt like taking a shift.
Don't hate me, Trinity.  I'm just the messenger.  And right now I'm going to prove it to you.
I got you.
Nearest exit is Franklin and Erie. An old appliance store.
I've been looking for you, Neo.  I don't know if you're ready to see what I want to show you, but unfortunately, we have run out of time.  They're coming for you, Neo. And I'm not sure what they're going to do.
Stand up and see for yourself.
Yes.  Now.
You could say that.
Wild, isn't it?
The body cannot live without the mind.
Trinity!  Go!  Get to the basement. Find the catch basin!
Shit, I'm sorry.
What is the Matrix?
Yes.
She told me...
I'm sorry, I'm not.  I'm just another guy.  Morpheus is the one that matters.
Why?
The Oracle.
He's alive.
Well, we're here for about two weeks, then whatever else comes along... we're still working on our album and...
Sounds good.
Well, my stuff comes from Maryland... you know what that means?
'And with your spirit.'
Panther!  Same thing...
Sure.  And you're gonna take the vows next Tuesday, right.
Wouldn't bother me.
Don't worry.  I can handle it.
Yeah, Teresa, shut up!  We don't wanna get Charlie here in trouble, do we?...We love Charlie.
No.
Forget it.
Michael, believe me.  You know the kid's a little crazy sometimes.  I vouched for him and he'll come through.  I promise.  I'll talk to him and straighten him out.  Don't worry, OK?
We'll be here.
Ok.
What was it?
No, c'mon...Y'know, I read.
Wha?
Oh yeah...didn't read it but I saw the movie...Gregory Peck...pretty good.
A paper on that one too?
It was nothing.  I'm almost finished.
I know you don't.  You've been very preoccupied lately.
The girls like it loud.
You what?
Yeah, speak for yourself.
A name?
He said he would be there with bells on.
I would say, sir, it is right up there with Jif and Skippy.  But miles ahead of Peter Pan.  Like a taste?
What side of the industry did you say you were on?
Joe sounds like a ringer, Bill.  I have the feeling you guys got the broad strokes already.  Need any help with the details?
Not good, not bad, you know what we got?  Nothing.  No credit, no cars, no mortgages -- no wives.  Nothing.
What?!
As much as Joe's?
But who is he?  What are his creden- tials?  What is his relationship to you?
You're on, Quin-cee.  Destination Hospital.  Joe, you'll be the Tour Guide.  Okay?  How's that sound to you?
Yes.
Mine, too.
No problem.  I'll leave you two alone.  I can tell you guys have something on the fire --
Peanut butter.
Be sorry for nothing.
I said get out.
I loved it.
Yes!
You want me to wait for you, you'll be back --
That's the best I can do.  ...but minute-by-minute, I find myself lingering.
Your doctor?  Did your doctor say anything about a tiny, undetectable hole in your aorta?  Did he mention an irreparab- ly weak vein in the further reaches of your famous brain?  Were there any prognostications about the possibil- ilites of a fatal collision on a golf cart or suffocating in an avalanche on a ski vacation in Gstaad?
I hope you realize, Bill...in your office this morning, that was your time.
No.
I'm sure you'll see to it that it won't be a problem.
This part I'm interested in.
Well, you're at the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong woman.
I'm her father!
Well, you goddam well should.  You walk into my life, give me the worst news a guy can get, have me dancing on the heads of pins with my busi- ness and with my family, and now you're spooning with my daughter.
Yes, and stop repeating everything I say, and turning it into a question. Spooning, fooling around, God knows what.  You arrive on the scene -- why you picked me, I still don't under- stand --
I don't expect you to.
I certainly hope so -- I loved Susan from the moment she was born, and I love her now, and every minute in between, and what I dream of is a man who will discover her and she will discover a man who will love her, who is worthy of her, who is of this world, of this time and has the grace and compassion and fortitude to walk beside her as she makes her way through this beautiful thing called life.
Death!
You're not Death.  You're just a kid in a jacket and a pair of pants.
I'm here.
The vodka.  What'd I tell you?
Hi, honey.
You won't tell him, and even if you did, he'd clock it and punch it into his laptop in order to pull out some key phrases when he gives the Commencement Speech at Wharton.
I know.  But I'm the only father you've got.
Then what will you say?
Now we love Drew and Joe in verbo- ten?  What's going on?
When you say 'nothing' that way, it's not nothing.
It's something.
I want you to know how much I love you.  That you've given a meaning to my life that I had no right to expect, and that no one can ever take from me.
No -- I love you so much and I want you to promise me something.  I don't want you to ever worry about me.  If anything should happen, I'm going to be fine and everything's going to be all right.  -- And I have no regrets.
'Pro bono'.  That means doing good -- Going to be doing good all your life?
You'd give up what you want for the woman you marry?
Not to me! I wasn't fucking married to her!
I'm Mr. Shelby from 304.
I'm sorry... um... ?
Burt, I'm not sure, but I may have asked you to hold my calls -  MEMENTO Blue Revisions - 8/27/99
Yeah, well you're not gonna remember, anyway.
Leonard.
Take the money and walk away!
That's the problem! How can I find John G. when I don't know what's going on?! How did you get me into this?!
I told him about your car.
He was beating the crap out of me! I had to tell him something!
Why not?
You have no idea where you've just come from? What you've just done?
You know it?
I don't remember.
No. No, just let me think for a minute.
Because she'll have taken one look at your clothes and your car and started thinking of ways to turn the situation to her advantage. She's already got you staying with her, for fuck's sake. 
He knows you're no good on the phone, so      * he calls you up to bullshit you.      * Sometimes you stop taking his calls, so   * he slips something under your door to     * frighten you into answering your phone    * again. He's been pretending to help you.      * Feeding you a line of crap about John G.      * being some local drug dealer.     *
'Cos he fucking told me. He thinks it's funny. He's laughing at you.
I'm a snitch. He's a cop from out of town looking for information. The local boys put us in touch.
I guess I can only make you believe the things you want to be true, huh? Like ol'     * Jimmy down there.
A load of amphetamine I told him I had.
Trudy and I are goin' for Gina...
Meth precursors and the Dutch party favors are en route.
Okay.  You got the "item"?
And our friend don't like the rest of the people bringin' the merch to you.
Two main players plus three.
25% discount on the load.
Make it 35.
Angola.  My mother was being a surgeon there.  She volunteered. Mozambique and Mali, too...  ...those days, in those days...she was part of Cuba's gift to the third world.  She came from a bourgeois family with a house in Verdado...we still have the house. We will go there...
She's dead...
And the chopsticks and fortune cookies?
They're all the same.  "Financial security is around the corner." "Your friends love you."
Who you run loads for?  Cause other than Nicholas, you knows you?
'Cause she will tell you.
What kind of weight?
Hit a couple of jazz clubs.  Fell back to her place.
Verdado.
It's in the suburbs outside Havana.
No.  Havana, Louisiana.  Don't we have a meet?
No.
We're makin' moves on each other.
This is Agent James Fujima.
What's your Miami PD badge number?
Okay.  What's up?
How do I discuss operations over an open line?
Have faith.
We think NLR.  We don't know! Alonzo only fronted as a broker for our guys to make the meet.  He wasn't deep into the crew.
Good idea.  We'll grab a bite.
You set this up!
Uh-uh.  No predetermined places and times to meet.  Give me their heading and radio codes and I will talk to them directly with the longs and lats and time which will be a last minute deal...
Joking? No, ma'am. Oh no! I mean business!
You sure are a pretty lady.
Oh, it ain't cheap. I mean, yeah, I'd say this was an all right shirt. Don't like to, uh, you know, have a lot of cheap stuff on my back.
Whatsa matter now?
You talk like a man with a tin twat.
Don't need a comb.
I'm wet.
I wet my pants! My seat's all wet.
Here I am going to Florida and my leg hurts, my butt hurts, my chest hurts, my face hurts, and like that ain't enough, I gotta pee all over myself.
Yessir, I can see that.
Well, uh, I'm raring to go.
Uh, yessir.
Ready for anything.
Gonna be like money from home.
History, man, history. How much?
Where?
Could be ten or fifteen.  Maybe even twenty.
Twenty fucking YEARS, man - YEARS! I figger ten at the least.
The prison, man. There was this German cat an architect in the hospital. He was helping the Turks build some shit round the place. I laid some bread on him and he let me copy them.
For the money... )
I know.
Two hundred dollars. It was my last two hundred.
Hashish.  Ninety percent of the foreigners are in for hashish.
What do you mean?
What's that?
Then we're outside the kogus. Then what?
After we're outside the kogus?
Max... Your BILLY shirt's on fire...
My passport!
Yeah... there's no straight lawyers in Turkey... They're all bent bent as hairpins...
New York's finest.
You got a better way up?
Someone'd have to go to the switchroom, pull the coupling lever, that'll send us left and to the elevator.
Hell, I might be able to juice the whole area, if I can get to the power box. It's just a couple of cables...
Is this a Catholic guilt thing...?
No, there's...
Listen to me:  we're getting you out.
Your arm, you can't...
What is it?
But you didn't even taste your cocoa.
I don't have a title yet.
It's crazy, but I don't really know, I mean I haven't written anything but "Misery" for so long that--you read it you can tell me what you think it's about. Maybe you can come up with a title.
I'm...
Yeah, thanks.
Great. I've always wanted to visit the other side of the room.
If I knew this was gonna be the surprise, you could've gotten me to burn all my books.
They always cheated like that in cliff--  --chapter plays.
A toast?
I don't know, it's weird, but a couple of broken bones hasn't done a lot for my creative juices. Get the fuck out of here.
Why, what are you going to do?  Kill me? Take your best shot.
Oh, no reason, you keep me prisoner, you make me burn my book, you drive a sledgehammer into my ankles...
Be my guest.
What? What is it?
You think he might be missing?
All done, chief..
Not possible..
Maybe that's it, then.  Everything's upside down and backwards...
Sit down.  You'll be a billionaire.  Better than being broke.  I've got terrorists and other pharmaceutical companies standing in line.  Ball's in your court, Mr. McCloy.
It's okay.  She scrambled the transmission.  Luther, continue feeding the GPS her position.
Right.
What if I pay the rent?
Uh-huh?
Listen to what?
Your help?  What are you talking about?
Oh bloody hell.  You're a spy.
I'd like a little more conviction..
You've either got it or you don't.  Let your conscience be your guide?
You noticed.  What're you going to do? Spank me?
Don't be.  Wouldn't be on vacation if you did.
Why did you phrase it like that?
'You're sorry and I'm sorry.'
She sacrificed herself..
Right.  I guess there aren't many flu epidemics in the middle of summer.
Ninety-seven minutes, twenty-seven seconds.
Look we can use someone from the Embassy and we can get the local authorities involved. Close off his transportation.
So what do you suggest?
Now we dont have to eliminate him?  You like that, dont you Claire?  Dont you?
I walked away.  He said abort.  He was gone so I walked away.
Who is "they?"
Who is they, who is they?
He's expecting my call.  I'm going to the station...  And I'm going to call him.
Who else is left?
Why was there another team?
Of IMF agents.  At the Embassy.  Tonight.
Let's see if you can follow me around this room.  The drunk Russians on the embankment at 7 and 8 o'clock...The couple waltzing around me at the Embassy at 9 and 11. The waiter behind Hannah at the top of the staircase - Bowtie, 12 o'clock. The other IMF team.  You're worried about me. <u>Why</u>?
About what?
Well my Mother was a little confused about how the DEA could mistake her and Uncle Donald for a couple of dope smugglers in the Florida keys.
We're not outta here yet.
Higher.
He's our guy.
Not this week. This week he's flyfishing at the Oughterard Slough in County Kildare, with one of our best Irish guides.
No, not in a hurry.  What do you think? You think the plot'll work?
If you were me, Ethan, who would <u>you</u> trust to make him believable?
Youre probably right.
Once we leave the safehouse, get in there and crash.  Ill call you from Paris.
And get a doctor.
Doesn't mean it's a signal.  Could just be the hard drive heating up.
You're not gonna marry him, Cosmo. Do you love him, Loretta?
I never seen anybody so in love like Cosmo back then! He'd stand outside the house all day and look in the windows. I never told you this cause it's not really a story. But one time I woke up in the middle of the night cause this bright light was in my face. Like a flashlight. I couldn't think a what it was. I looked out the window, and it was the moon! Big as a house! I never seen the moon so big before or since. I was almost scared, like it was gonna crush the house. And I looked down, and standing there in the street was Cosmo, looking up at the windows. This is the funny part. I got mad at you, Cosmo! I thought you brought this big moon over to my house cause you were so in love and woke me up with it. I was half asleep I guess and didn't know no better.
No. You were there.
I don't know. I got a feeling.
Maybe I should come back another time.
That light.
It's the best thing there is.
No. I'm gonna wait.
Johnny.
You've made me very happy, Johnny.
No.
Pop don't like Johnny.
Hi. Why ain't you at the store?
What are you doing here? You're supposed to be in Palermo.
A miracle. Well, that's news.
You're kidding?
That's incredible.
What happened?
Sure.
She looks like one. Yes, she does.
He knows of a cave ... a cave which no man has entered.
I cannot tell you.  Suffice to say is one of the words the Knights of Ni! cannot hear!
You said it again!
No, no ... not "is"!
My liege,  I am honored.
It's the ... oh ...  it's the ... it's on the tip of my tongue ...
There.
It is the rabbit.
What?
And don't apologize.  Every time I try to talk to someone it's sorry this and forgive me that and I'm not worthy and ... What are you doing now?
Well, don't. |      I really don't know where all this got started. It's like those miserable psalms.  they're so depressing. Now knock it of
Right.  Arthur, King of the Britons, you're Knights of the Round Table shall have a task to make them an example in these dark times ...
Course it's a good idea.
Stop! Who approacheth the Bridge of Death Must answer me These questions three! Ere the other side he see!
What is your name?
What is your quest?
What is the capital of Assyria?
Yes ...  I'm very sorry ...
Well, I'm really am most awfully sorry but I ... I can explain everything ...
Shut up!  You only killed the bride's father - that's all -
What is your name, handsome knight?
Mine is Zoot. Just Zoot  But come.
No.  It's unhealthy.
No, I'm not.
Don't say that word.
I think he nearly ruptured his truss.
Get out.  Out!
I take no account of gossip, Your Highness.
Of course.
I see.
A situation?
I'm flattered you think so.
Quite.
That's a tautology lad.  If you say the Queen arranges something, you've no need to say she's done it personally.  That's understood.
She'll need to sign dispatches before she retires.
There are important papers from --
Why do you think I keep her here?
Sir Henry is not alone.  They all wish it.  The same people who refused to grant my husband the title of King because he was deemed of insufficient rank--
Yes, ma'am?
Yes, ma'am.
Yes, ma'am.
Forgive me, ma'am, I cannot speak for the nation, only for myself.  As Prime Minister I confess I miss your presence, but that is only an expression of my own selfish desires and I should not burden you with it.
Not too protracted, I hope.
Mr Brown is unable to attend today.
I believe he is unwell, ma'am.
I understand he was in a fight.
I believe not, ma'am.  I understand -- he'd had rather too much to drink.
Please tell the Princess, and other signatories to this letter, that the Queen will not be dictated to, or made to alter, in any way, what she has found to answer for her comfort.  Do I make myself clear?
Yeah, who isn't.
He's probably outside.  You know how he is. Gets bored...
I'm in the middle of it...
She thought Benz was at school.
And beat it at it's own game.
I was afraid you'd say that.
Yes I am...
And what if something happens to you? Am I suppose to go in after you alone?!
There...
And then keep on driving?
Of course I am.
I miss you so much, Alex.  I want so much to be with you...
Can you say anything but "cool"?
I'll speak to someone.
I told ya.
Now I guess you and your Aunt have an understanding. So here's the key and you need anything, just give a holler.  Everybody in this building's pretty much okay with me or they wouldn't be here. If you want, later I'll introduce you around. No hard feelings if you don't, and don't forget the rooftop garden. It's just up the stairs we passed. It's open to all the tenants. You can see the Hollywood sign from there.
You got it! See you later honey.
Yes.
Very pleased to meet you.
I'll go with you. She's still got some of my stuff.
Not that I can see.
Everything is A-okay, but I've gotta get that sandwich!
Nothing... I don't like being out in the open like this.
Not a coke or anything?
Sure, reach in my shirt pocket there.
What's going on ?
No where. We've got about seven minutes before this thing slams into a concrete wall.
I'm working on it.
It's called Murderland. It's paid for by First Bank.
It's a tax write off for John C. McCay.
Knows ? He watches every "Guest" on tape. This whole place is here for his sick amusement. And no so are we.
Okay.
I work here, remember ?
Well, surprise, surprise, I've been on the payroll for several years now. I still have an office and secretary. No one even batted an eyelash. Do you realize what the high turnover is in a multi corporation bank in New York ?
That's a shame.
Well, I'll see you at the next staff party.
I'd get out of the water if I were you.
Ow...
Here. Am I ever going to get to run the controls for one these capers ?
When will that be ?
Look, you're going to have to start trusting me sometime. I am a trustworthy person.
RESPECT is earned not given away, trust is given away to anybody.
I've been working with you for four years, don't you think that's worthy of at least one turn at the controls ?
What do you mean sir ?
Sir ?
Sir, he created the Park. He would know how to circumvent any of the traps.
What then sir ? What would we do with the park with out Bruce ?
John, sir.
Sir, this is not like firing any employee. We can't predict what will happen.
We should have another fifteen minutes at least.
What ?????
Yes. I think he's feeling sick or something.
Do you want to go out with me ?
Yes.
Yes.
As appealing as that sounds...
Sure.
Fine, fine, I feel like a chicken McNugget.
I want to go to sleep for about a month.
Where are we ?
No, no, no, I gave it up ten years ago...actually it gave me up.
Me, I'll know!
Okay thanks, atta girl.
Of course.
Honey I know it's fun to think about these things but....
What??
Listen, if a boy wants to do homework with you, it really means he didn't have nerve to ask you out on a date, so you'll get your homework together and pretend to be studying, and the next thing you know you're ordering pizza and talking about your favorite movie stars.
I'm sorry, it's just...I've been taking all these seminars to get in touch with my feelings and...sometimes it gets out of hand.
We performed on the beach one summer...ha...everything went wrong.
It's okay with me, hi Kevin.
Great, I have so much to say, I hardly know where to start.
Thanks, but I think I'm gonna stick to my mom, she led a fascinating life too.
Just remember the needle in the haystack.
What difference does it make?
Oh my gosh, here it is!
And I thought I was weird.
Oh, no wait, I like that you bought me here.
Montgomery Clift, wait 'till I tell Shelly.
Some sacrifices are worth it.
I wouldn't say it was terrible...it was...kind of...
Part adventure...part miracle.
That's ridiculous, I'm...I'm very, umm, what do you call it?
Committed.
Yes, it does.
Sounds like you're very organized.
What, did you think he was raised by a pack of wolves? Don't be misled by the haircut.
Oh, sure okay.
O.K.
WHAT?
This guy bonking you?
I think it's still available.
Uhh, Miss devoto...
Uhh, Miss devoto, these people are already at ease. This is not a Beauty Parlor, it's a Funeral Parlor.
Yes they are.
Deceased.
What's that?
Why d'you think these seats were empty.
Want to what?
Yes.
You can get the general idea...
Then who's it for?
Hey guess what? We're going to the carnival tonight, be ready to go in 10 minutes.
Nothing, I'm dressing.
That's Suzanne.  She and I are gonna be married this Fall.
Chocolate?
No.
A girl's always gotta look her best.
Have you ever tried any?
Come here, sit down.
Vada, Vada, what's the matter?
Well he just left, what's wrong?
What do you mean you're hemorrhaging?
I can't, I have to go home.
What?
Hey, where does it say that?
I am running faster!!
Uh huh.  Okay, enough practice.
But then I won't be able to see anything.
I honestly wish I could...
Solid and genuine is not boring. Michael can be completely insane...
I noticed.  I'm on the noon back. We have this thing with George's family in the Hamptons.
What do you suggest?
I can be quick.  I can even be funny.
So your honeymoon is exactly where?
Oh, that.  I forgot I even said th...
Probably am.  Forget I brought it up.
They'll eat it anyway, you ever been to a walk?
I had this crank call?  From some guy who thinks he saw her? I said, what would a bride be doin', on her wedding...
Nobody has.  So far.
Mirrors.
Hey, cabs are expensive.  I'm cheap, remember?
Michael, it sounds like a wonderful opportun...
Me either.
It's just... up there... right in front of Walter's... y'know, computer. If memory serves.
I just want to be alone.  Is that okay?
This is the dumbest thing I will ever do.  So dumb, in fact, that I can't.  I don't think.
... me, yeah.  And she likes Tommy Lasorda.  Case closed.
Well, if that's the way you f...
Yes. I'm cutting a record.
Is there food?
Well, I just wondered 'cause being from out or town I wouldn't be able to make anything.
I'll go on. Ester'1l be very glad.
A little slow, but she'll be fine.
Who the hell is he?
Who the hell is he?
Third party?
What does he want?
What!
You know better than that.
I don't care. She's always been neutral in politics and that's not going to change.
When is it?
Yes, sir. Like you to meet Opal.
Your wire Ester - she passed away.
What did you say?
I see... Well, those doctors are real miracle workers.
Maybe you can look after me a little.
Keep warm, dear. Let me hear from you.
Bye.
I'm not sure.
Oh.
Money's no object.
Pretty good. Sure was surprised to hear from you. You talk to Bill?
They're looking all over for you. Do you have a copy of the album.
You think I got any kind of a voice?
What...
The prison board made the decision. A board of which I belong. We're the who. The why is simple. Mickey and Mallory are mentally ill and need to be under a doctor's care, where hopefully they'll receive the help they need.
Well, since that time, they've killed one person during their trail. And since their incarceration, they've killed one psychologist along with several guards and inmates.
What's changed, Mr. Gayle, is our minds. We felt they were competent a year ago. A year has passed, sir, a year where they were under close observation, day in and day out, and their behaviour has led us to believe we were wrong.
The prison board and the doctors who examined them.
Using the same doctors is not common practice.
Now that you bring it up, yes. They were different men. I hadn't really thought that much about it. Since many psychiatric opinions are, by a rule, sought out for this kind of situation. What do you think normally happens? The Knoxs are assigned a family psychologist that takes care of them throughout the rest of their lives? The state doesn't work like that.
She's in the holding cell, on this floor.
Have you talked to Mallory about this?
She doesn't talk?
She sings? What does she sing?
Sure.
No. Not really.
Just save your breath, Wayne. We hate you. If anybody in the fuckin' world deserves to die, it's you.
Yes.
Wayne---
Would the network really not run it without the interview?
Same here. Let me introduce my crew. Scott...Roger...and Unruly Julie ...this is...I'm sorry. What's your title again?
That sounds great. Look, I don't want any of this to intimidate you. This is not going to be a big deal. This is going to be very easy.  I need to talk with Mr. Wurlitzer. You guys get your equipment ready, power up the van and confirm a transmission code for the remote. Julie come with me.
Man, the darkest thing they got in there is Coca-Cola.
Now, if you want to work like a real nigger, you can always go out and chop cotton.
They pay you three bucks a day an' all the cotton you can eat.
No. You got the wrong idea.
Name's Duff.
Okay.
Thanks.
Guess I don't.
No. I'm new in town.
Yeah. On the section gang.
I get it.  Yeah, I can see your old man with a shot-gun right now.
You would, huh? If I was you, baby - I wouldn't go 'round stickin' out my jugular vein.
You almost got into trouble back there.
Hell, baby, I'm not in the third grade. Well, look - what' we gonna do next time -- have a nice long chat in the parlor?
Oh yeah, and then what?
Well, either we're gonna hit the hay or get married. Now you don't want to hit the hay, and I don' want to get married.
All right, so I'm primitive. So what d'you want with me?
Hell, baby, I don't know what to say.
Yeah?
Huh?
You jivin' me?
I can't stand to see you like that. I know you can't help it.
Let's go, Jocko. The man's got homework.
Plannin' on getting married?
'Don't sound so sure.
Yeah. That's how me an' your mother got started. I'm tellin' you, boy, you ain't got a chance without dough. They take it all away from you.
She don't look no worse to me.
Don't do her no good to go into a tree.
I said, she's in great shape.
Oh yeah?
Your mother used to lay for her boss, boy. Did you know that?
Okay, so what's a girl supposed to do? Me not workin' and her cleanin' house for a white man. I'm tellin' you, boy, keep away from marriage. Ya gotta stay light on your feet or you won't make it.
Nice and slow. You come in. Get a look around.  Then I get my wife.
She was prettier before she tarted herself up with the hardware.
An Artificial Intelligence. A computer system that's developed the capacity for sentient thought. They're dangerous and totally unpredictable.
My days of punching deck are over. For you or anybody else.
I'd say you were full of shit.
What about McCoy?
Prepping your trip.
Offworld. The A.I.... this "Wintermute" thing evolved on a computer mainframe on the satellite Freeside. If you attack it from within the matrix while Molly accesses its original programming we can cripple its defence systems.
You'll be linked during the entire operation.
The words?
Ah, yes... the code. It's a riddle, actually. Some fancy of 3Jane's. Unfortunately, you'll have to find out for yourself. I can no more know that code than I can shut down my own hard wired defences. Now, our time is running short... and you haven't even touched your drink.
Patience, Mr. Case. Only one hour and thirty-eight minutes to enlightenment.
All things possible in Babylon.
No problem, amigo.
Those guys couldn't even find their own dicks with tweezers and a magnifying glass.  Tell you what, Bro. I'll make you a deal. I help you nail this A.I., you gotta do me one favour.
When we're done, erase this friggin' tape.
How's the ice?
It's coming.
I said, it's coming. Just get me in, man.
Then I'll fry taking this son of a bitch out. I'm making the run, Dixie.
You set me up from the beginning. It was you that got Julius killed.
And Linda...
I'm gonna burn you to the ground, you son of a bitch.
Shut down your ice patterns. I'll take you out.
Why would you want me to kill you?
I think you're full of shit.
Couple of days. They'll examine you.
They'll cut you down.
...And if I guess wrong?
We've still got to find the mainframe.
Until Guy tells them to go. Once they watched me for like two hours. I found my car the next day in the T.J. Maxx parking lot.
Are you kidding, Josie? It's lame. All they do is stand around and get drunk. It's lame.
Yes, it's lame.
Exactly.
I thought this was a 45-minute seminar.
No - It's just a lot of pressure for your first piece, that's all. I mean, it's not a half-page article, it's a major undercover piece, Jos. Look what Rigfort did to Dutton - and that guy's his cousin!
Just get in the van, Josie.
Why?
And you're leading with the terrible truth about cole slaw?!
Geller...you wanna be a reporter? Take a look at what sells! Sex scandals. Bribery. People jumping off buildings. So unless a kid just killed himself because he was being paid to have sex with the school mascot in a big vat of this cole slaw, you got nothing!
Are you in special ed?
Maybe because we're not supposed to be having sex with bananas.
Wow. That's big. I mean sex is a really big deal. You shouldn't do it until you know you've found the right person.
I can't do this.
Really?
I know.
Why do you do that?
That's okay. It's nice to have someone to talk to--
I just can't look at you the same way.
Relax, Monty. It's just my sister.
Everybody knows about--
I know.
<i>                      -- A bow? --        But why? --                  How ugly! -- What's in it? --                What's in it?</i>
<i>                      -- It's a bat. --              Will it bend? -- It's a rat. --              Will it break? -- Perhaps it's the head that I found in the lake.</i>
It's not the gas, Dad!
Jesse's dead!  I sliced 'im real good!
Only the wet ones.
Yeah, yeah, sure.
Only it was more like, you know, sleep- walking.  All I know is I woke up on the cellar floor next to it.
What do you mean?
I'm not hungry.
There's nothing to figure out.
We must look like a couple of escapees from a veterans' hospital.
Hi, Kerry.
All of them.
Mom's trying to keep him upstairs.
Morning, Doctor Goldman.
I think new York was just what I needed.  So many people.  I never feel alone.
I don't know.  I'm busy with school. New friends.  But I'll never forget the old ones.
To old friends.
How do we find him, Kristen?
She's been waiting outside your office since breakfast.
Nancy...
I'm running out of answers. A patient sleepwalks out of a security ward up to a tower with no access.  A girl, alone in a room, dies by jumping six feet straight up into a television set. Nothing makes sense anymore.
For what?
Try me.
I can do that.
Just go.  Kristen needs you.  Keep her awake somehow.  Do it.
No.  We're alone.
For God's sake, Elizabeth...just try to help the kids, will you?  Listen to them.
And you.  I'll wait till you've gone before I tell him you're a vegetarian.
Really?
I forgot my bag.
And what happens next in the dream?
Step aside.
No, that's fine.  It's not often one has the opportunity to adios the plates of a major Hollywood star.  It was a thrill for me.  How is he?
Well, there's a question -- without an interesting answer.
Oh no no -- no.
Who was Gilda?
You're lovelier this morning than you have ever been.
I mean -- today's newspapers will be lining tomorrow's waste paper bins.
Well, you know -- it's just one day. Today's papers will all have been thrown away tomorrow.
And what would you say...
And this is William.
Yes, I think that one may be.
William has just turned down Anna Scott.
Yes?
Hello, Anna ahm...  Scott -- have some wine.
So not over her, in fact.
Thanks.  Great.  Wish me luck.
You're welcome.  Did you find them?
Three.
Is it true McMurphy killed two attendants and escaped yesterday?
Will you come with me, please.
Not at all, Mister McMurphy...
He's into his wind-up. Here comes the pitch. Strike on the inside corner!
H-H-Hearts.
Y-y-yes, a b-b-bus!
M-M-M-Mack?
That okay. I'll take your marker. How many ya want?
I dunno. Where do ya wanna go?
My feet hurt...
I don't see you scoring any points, buddy. And you're just the man for the job, right?
She's not all that homely, Mister McMurphy. In fact, she must have been a rather beautiful young lady.
I refuse!
No!
I just started!
I don't trust you!
Wait a minute, Martini, I can't hear a thing.  What?
Me too! Me too!
Just fine, Doc... In fact, I think I might've put on a couple of pounds since I got here.
Come on, Doc, you know as well as I do what's been comin' down in that loony bin.
Shoot, Doc, the only one I'm disturbing is that old nurse and her fixed ways. That's all.
Yeah, yeah, you're a fucking phony, McMurphy!
He can't hear you. He's just a deaf and dumb Indian!
Yeah, that's a good idea, Turkle. Why don't ya take Rose on a little tour of our facilities...
Hi.
After you, ma'am.
Ah guess the natives are restless, ma'am...
Ah, no, ma'am... well, yes, ma'am...  A man get awful lonely at night, if ya know what Ah mean, ma'am...
No, she wasn't my sister.
Of course not.
Look, she wasn't a relative, okay? I don't know who she is.
What for?
My name isn't Damon Bradley.  I just told you it was Damon Bradley.
Wait.  I have to write this down.
Amazing.
Non.  Please.
If it's any of your business, yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Tell me.
Please.  I need to know.
Mickey Spillane?
What are you doing here?
No.  Course not.
That's not the point.  And what if I had wanted to?
Brunello di Montalcino, '85, please.
You're an accountant for cryin' out loud.
Yes you did.
Look, I know you think this is irresponsible of me, but think how much more irresponsible it would be to marry the wrong person. 
Faith, I've seen it already, okay? If I spot somebody who's got a head that's an eighth of an inch around, standing underneath a tuba, I'll recognize him from the photo. Otherwise, I'm telling you, it's not gonna do me any good.
Well, you don't have to get snippy with me.
Oh my God.  Where?
Is he looking at us?
Yes.  Isn't that amazing?
Uh huh.
You don't have to go if you don't want to...
She's not here.
She went out to check into skywriting.  I can't believe you lied.  Is this a genetic thing, men will say anything just to get laid?
The Joey Doyle thing. You know how he is. Things like that he exaggerates them. Too much Marquis of Queensbury.  It softens 'em up.
Nolan? I knew he had guts but
Tommy, what happened?
Good. So do I.
Why keep harpin' on it?  Come on, drink up. You got to get a little fun out of life. What's the matter with you?  I'll play you some music.
There's a hawk around. They're scared tonight.
Do what I told you. Take care of Charley.
Get out of my way.
You got eyes. I'm right in front of you.
What do you want from me, Father.
Mind your own business, Father.
Why don't you go and chase yourself?
You go to hell.
You go to
Take it easy.
O.K., O.K., That's enough.
Take it easy now, Terry.
Not a dent.  Perfect
Thirty-six sev aah I lost the count.
I was only talkin' to her.
I can look at her, can't I? It's a free country.
Fiend is it!  You will not be so fortunate.  Your existence will cease within moments.  No one wishes to see a man dance...  And you, my dear, will entertain for centuries to come.
..Oh, You could do nothing!  I can save you much pain.
I do not joke in my proposal.
Be careful!
Nothing is worth your life.
I'm frightened.  I'm so frightened.
Be careful, oh please be careful.  We'll never get out of here alive, I know it.  I just feel it.
Yes I feel it in my bones.
Oh, no I'm not.  These heathens probably have an open grave for us.
I should hope not.  I hate you!
Yes, that sudden.  If it weren't for you we wouldn't be hunting for an old cemetery on a night like this.  It's all your fault.
Ahh, she will be yours.
At your discretion...But first, I desire more entertainment.
Ahh, there is yet time.
I know the laws of the night. I state there is still time for yet another.
Your own pleasure comes only after mine, when I desire it. I am the Sole Ruler of the Dark World.  There is no one to challenge my authority here. My word is the law--all powerful. <b>No one</b> is to challenge that authority, <b>no one!</b>.  Is that understood?  It is my command.
Then see that it does not happen again, in the penalty of Everlasting Despair.  Now are there others?
Well then let us proceed.
Aaaaahhnnnhaaaaaannnhhh?
Aaaahhhhnnnahhhnnnggnnn.
They didn't <i>tell</i> me anything, they asked questions.
I know a Glenn.
Oh.  Uh-huh.
Yeah, I was Emil's box-jumper for almost four years.
His assistant.
The green-and-whites saw us.  One of 'em starts thinking, what's that car doing there?  Ties it to the break and turns around...
Am I going to Detroit by myself?
Love is funny.
Yes, she did.
You know how I felt about her.
It wasn't about getting laid.  I just wanted to know what might've happened if things were different.
Yeah, I did.
All you gotta do is get in.
What?  Daniel, I wanna go upstairs.
Yeah.  And I thought everyone liked Eddie.
Dude in the dress is Eddie Solomon, used to buy scag off a corner till he kicked it and found his happiness with crack and then started dealing himself. Word on the street was he was saving up for an operation.
Yeah, Eddie was a real character.  Had these girls cooked the rocks he called the Rockettes.
Yonelle.  Looks like someone raped her, shot her, then threw her out the window.  Fuckin' animals.
Just like it.  Nobody backing down. You back down, you pussy.  Tell me what you and Buddy doing up here in the cold?
Not until recently.
A little.
You're right.  So why take a chance--
Faye Dunaway.
<i>Network</i>.  Yeah, she was good.
Peter Finch.
Bleeding on a country road.
Love it.
I'm a sales rep.  I came here to call on a customer and they gave me a hard time because I'm a girl.
What, as a sales rep?
I don't have a problem with it.
I had one just like it -- well, it was the same idea, but I had to get rid of it.
It smelled.
No.  What do you do for a living, Gary?
Where?
Ever seen an uncut diamond, Studs? They look like plain old rocks.
My point is, that's probably what you're gonna end up with.
Use your head.  The guys got five million lying around his house, you really think he's gonna tell some motormouth he just met in prison about it?
Oh, uh, right, thanks...
How are you, Richard?
Maurice Miller, couple of his friends.
It couldn't have been out at Glades, if that's what you're thinking.  I was never out there.
Oh, I'm here, all right.  I'm very here. Question is, why aren't <u>you</u> here?
Oh...
Something better.  Open it.
I couldn't swear to it, but I'm pretty sure he did.
I didn't have time.
I knew it, soon as I saw they were offering a reward.
Jack Foley, famous bank robber.
He was that good?
You guys are new?
Hey, you wanna test my limits, you better line up a couple dozen women on the GROUND...cause I got NO limits in the air!
Come on!
What's between you and her is between you and her.  But here's what's between you and me.  Everybody has a hero, Danny. And you're mine.
Hang on.
Colonel...we're all going.  Whether you make it or not.
The only reason it's hard to say is that I keep thinking I don't have the right to say it.  But I've got to because it's true.  I love you.  That must surprise you.
I have arranged a live fire drill -- with your permission.
If knowledge of opponents and careful calculation of danger is taken as weakness then I have misunderstood what it means to be Japanese.
I hope so. At least I got to see you and Grandma.  Has it ever worked before?
It's not the place. I don't buy that.  Trapped in the same town forever. The price she would pay for her teenage lust.
Oh, it's not so bad. I have two wonderful kids, my own business.  Still, knowing what I know now, if I had the chance to do it all over again, I'd sure do things a lot differently.
Just what you underlined.
Come on. What's with you and Michael?
Don't say that...
Hey, I can take a hint. You look great today.
You're damn right! Jesus! Peggy! You sure know how to spoil a mood.
Fat chance. You know, Lee Wilkins came to hear me last night. He told me to forget it. You told me to forget it. My parents tell me to forget it.
If you took the trouble to write it, then sure, I'll take a look at it. But I'm beginning to think that maybe there's more to life than music. I wonder if people would still like me if I stopped being Mr. Excitement?
Do you think anybody in the Fifties ever made love on a bed?
Test?
I wish I had the nerve. And the figure.
I shouldn't have put you through that. It must have been agony. Let's do something.
I think I'm way ahead of them.
This is not giving blood. This is drunk.
Oh. I forgot.
I went for a drive. Up in the hills.
Can I tell Diane that Peggy Sue got drunk or is that a deep family secret?  Well?
I'm writing a book on kite construction. What did you want to talk about?
Are you doing some kind of science project?
Well... in a Newtonian framework, the possibilities were limited, but with the advent of relativity theory, the idea of absolute time can no longer be reasonably affirmed.
Come on. You can't be serious.
Are you talking ~about exercise? Like gym?
Goodbye? Where're you going? What about our partnership? I'm making real progress with the microchip.
So are you. You've got a vision.
Did you break up with Charlie?
Okay. Why don't we do something visionary. Change your destiny, Peggy Sue. Change your destiny and marry me.
Wait! I'll go with you!
How'd you know that?
Nothing. I just got spooked by a bunch of furballs.
I can bring her back. The same way Drew and me brought Zowie back...
He pissed me off.
You think he'd believe it if he did?
You know everything, don't you?
What's that on your forehead, pal?
I am relaxed.
Bearing in mind that Bill Wright, the chairman of MacroSystems, is a close, personal friend of mine... which side of this mess would <u>you</u> desire to be on, Andy? And don't allow my very tight, personal relationship with Bill to influence your answer in any way.
Dr. Klenstein.  It's not a pleasant procedure, but if the KS is causing the diarrhea, we ought to know right away.
As in, the vegetable?
Any settlement agreement <u>must</u> include, and this is critical, a letter of exoneration, making clear my termination had nothing to do with the quality of my work.
You're ready, don't worry.
You bet. We'll see you later.
Answer the question, please.
Thank you.
What did you say?
Thank you. No more questions.
Right.
Not by touching, or shaking hands, or hugging, using the same toilet... Even kissing someone with AIDS is safe. But it there's something in your past you're worried about...
Yes, character. To the extent that it affects a person's ability to do a great job.
Great, Lisa. Thank you.
So you are aware of the difference between a lesion and a bruise, is that correct?
But didn't you avoid contact with Ms. Torres, after you found out she had AIDS? She says you acted repulsed by her and you avoided her, is that correct?
We ought to be suing him.
He died fast. And if we got any choice, that's the way we should all go out.  Don't you cry for Johns. Don't you dare.
No, we'd never....Oh, God, honey, you shoulda told me sooner.
Saw something I didn't like.
We can't make it.
I know what's in here!
Tell me it's not a mirage.
Sir Shiv-a-lot. He likes to cut.
I assume he licked it clean.
May've noticed chains don't work on this guy. Only way we're truly safe is if he believes he's goin' free. But if he <u>stops</u> believin' --
-- we need a fail-safe. Bring the cells over at the last possible minute -- when the wings are ready, when we <u>know</u> we're ready to launch.
We're just burnin' light here.
I don't get it, Johns. What is so goddamn valuable in your life that you're worried about losing? Huh? Is there anything at all? Besides your next hype?  Got no right to be so scared. Neither one of us.
Just tell me we're still in the shipping lane. Just show me all those stars, all those bright, beautiful, deep-space....
What?
I would rather we all stay--
All deserts have water, somewhere. God shall lead us there.
Maratha crow-bill war-picks from Northern India. Very rare.
Well, you got the big gauge.
What do you care?
Certainly, sir. I'll get my notes and come right over.
You still don't believe me, do you?
No.
Because if he is a missing link, it means the Sacred Scrolls aren't worth their parchment.
No, thank you'. I won't get into that battle.
Zira, listen to me. We've got a fine future ahead of us. Marriage. Stimulating careers. I'm up for a raise --
Him.
Sustained.
Forget it. Abandon ship.
Okay.
I think you're making a mistake.
What?
Bailiff! Stop this outburst! Gag that monstrosity!
I told the truth at that 'hearing'of yours.
My tribe, as you call it, lives on another planet in a distant solar system.
What about it?
I take it you don't believe the prosecutor's charge -- that I'm a monster created by Dr. Zira.
That's exactly what Zira and Cornelius claim. You're talking heresy, doctor.
All right, suppose I am a mutant? Why does the appearance of one mutant send you into a panic?
Then you admit --
Thank you for calling me Taylor.  Dr. Zaius, I know who I am. Who are you? How did this upside down civilization ever get started?
I don't know.
I'm not protecting anybody! That hearing was a farce. What have I done?
My - name - isn't - Bright Eyes It's Taylor!
He has a point. On my planet children often play with ape dolls.
Sirs: our theories have a bearing on his identity.
Stay out of this Elias. This ain't your show.
That reminds me, I gotta take a shit.
Yeah if you let me have your shirt.
Then what do you suggest big shot?
Yeah. No pain in my neck now. Feels good.
Nah...
Sounds like it.
...and you know how many times he done been shot?  Seven times!  Seven.
Jackson, looks like you got Elias' squad now.
These two holes are yours...
I don't want to hear your problems, Jackson. You'll get new men any day. Time being you make do like everybody else.
I don't want to hear about it Jackson.
That's right. I don't want to hear about it 'cause to tell you the truth, I don't give a shit okay... I just don't give a shit anymore.
This is one time we could sure use Elias.
How do you do?
I see.
I don't need it that badly. I don't enjoy crashing other people's parties.
What did you say his name was?
You don't sound as if you liked him very much.
As I said before...
There wasn't any plane.
Nothing matters.
You leave it.
If it has to be--do you mind if I do it myself?  Oh, I don't mean with the gun. This is no trick.  When I wrote that note you have in your pocket-- that was no trick either.  It's not so hard for me as you think. I'm not crying about it, I've been skating close to it for quite some time.  The water is cold down there--  But so is everything else.  And there's you.
Yes.  You.  You're not really a murderer yet.
Deep blue? I'd call it grey-blue.
I've been a soldier too.  There is a difference.  A policeman, like a judge, has a right to disqualify himself on proper grounds.
I know that.
There's an empty taxi across the street.  If you're so anxious, take it.  He'll know the way to the police headquarters.
Sometimes.
Goodbye, Betty.
Why not here?
Charlie's suits me fine. I don't scare.
You're not English.
If it doesn't take too long.  Drink?
Did I do something wrong?
How would you know, Brandon?
You don't throw guests out, Brandon.
Floater?
You're the waterfront specialist. Find out about it.  I've got a murder to investigate.
Drunk-rolling job.  They hit him too hard.
Let me know when you've identified him
Open it and count it.
I think so.
Should be over there.
I was in love with him... which shows you the quality of my brains.  Why don't you ask her about the gun?
Anybody could commit suicide, if he felt low enough. I've felt it myself.
I'd be delighted to... anytime you can show me the doubt. I'll wrap it up in tissue paper and put a Christmas seals on it for her.
When I give an order, you'll not need it interpreted.  You have an hour to make your mind up.  Well, are ye satisfied, Mr. Mitchell?
She is much younger than I am. That's something I'm going to have to get used to. Isn't it, Larry? They'll all be much younger than I am. Here.  Tear them up.
It's fine, thank you.
Please do.  I was beginning to wonder who this Mr. Penfield was.
Sit on that log, dear.
Of course.
It needn't concern you, Edward. James has got some news.  He needs a poet's advice.
I quite liked it.  I wasn't as enthusiastic as everyone else.
I think it went on rather too long.
And I didn't like that man.
And the shape of it all.  It was sort of...shapeless.
You don't like flashbacks because your mother's a historian.
Too bad.  What did your father do?
No.  It's a bit of a madhouse. For some reason a lot of my mother's friends specialise in monologues.
To the Fleet.
The Argies.
Fuck off.
My God.  You even cooked up that Norfolk trip.
You're a piece of shit
No.
I won't.  Goodnight.
News, last night... those guys, the Ex-Presidents... they robbed my bank yesterday.  And I was just there the day before, cashing a check.  See... look.  Assured Trust... same place.
She'll be fine, Rosie won't do anything.  At least not as long as I meet him at a certain place and time, about... let's see...  ... six hours from now.
Jesus Christ, Bodhi!
Take your hand off my shoulder right now.
Well, what're your ideas on these guys?
So you're gonna coast to retirement, when you could nail these guys and go out with come dignity.
Guy's the Toxic Avenger.
Angelo, we gotta talk.
No, no.  See, all my life I've done things for other people.  In high school I played football because my old man expected me to.  Then my parents always figured I'd go to law school, so I did.  Football scholarship.  Graduated Phi Beta Kappa--
Wait, so I'm a big hero to my folks, right?  But two years ago they got killed in a car wreck and I just suddenly realized all my goals had been their goals.  And I hadn't been living my own life.  So I wanted something for myself.  Something that maybe didn't make any sense.  You know what I mean?
Warm them up.
I can't believe Jim Hopper walked into an ambush.
What about the rest of Hopper's men?
That's right, I set you up. You're a veteran at this, Dutch, I had to.
Because I told you, you're the best. I knew you could do it but I couldn't get you in here without a cover story.
We've been lookin' for this place for months. The chopper must have gotten close when they got shot down. Hopper was sent in to get my men. He was just doing his job. When he disappeared I had to clean this up, I had to stop there bastards. We were so close, we couldn't quit. We couldn't sleep through this one. I needed you, Dutch, can't you see that?
What, Sergeant?
We figure we've got less than twenty-four hours to catch up with them. After that, there's not much hope. We want a rescue operation mounted tonight. That doesn't give you much time.
You're not getting any navy contracts.
Who indeed...
Actually, I'm a movie star out for a walk.
Sure.  For five bucks.
The price just went up to ten.
Sit... and spin.
What?
Why?
Jesus, you act like you're seducing some Valley girl you picked up in a dance club.
What are assets?
C'mon, I might buy a company some day.
Sorta like stealing cars and selling'm for parts, huh?
There, see?  Now the emblem is right in the middle of the knot.
I fucked the debate team in high school.  Tsk.  I had a grampa. He liked ties on Sundays.  You mind if I take a swim in your bathtub before I hit it?
Television?
I have work to do.
I'm sure that's true for some of them.
Ready to stomp sod?
I'm glad you like it.  Now be quiet, I've really got to read these.
It was good.
Edward, if the three of us sit down together we might as well announce our plans in the Wall Street Journal.
You shouldn't go alone.  He might claim that you tried to black mail him.
Oh, god, what?
So now they're best friends? Edward, this girl appears out of nowhere and now I see her talking to a guy whose company we're trying to buy.  It's too convenient.
Industrial espionage is not ridiculous.  Edward, how do you know she hasn't attached herself to you so she can bring Kross back information?
Don't be mad at me.  I'll pay you back.  I promise.
I will.  I'm trying.  Meanwhile I got some crack left, you wanna get high?
Okay.  I'm sorry I said your dream was stupid.
And leave all this?  Not in a million.
Edward is taking me to some fancy place for dinner.  The Rex.  Ever been there?
Yeah, mine too.  Is it like, y'know, normal?
Will I like it?
Okay.  Thanks, Barney.  You're the best.
Do you remember me?
I was in here yesterday.
I suggest a deal. You write four copies of a letter. I'll send my four fastest ships. One in each direction. The Dread Pirate Roberts is always close to Florin this time of year. We'll run up the white flag and deliver your message. If Westley wants you, bless you both. If not ... please consider me as an alternative to suicide. Are we agreed?
You admit to me you do not love your fiance?
"Are not capable of love" is what you mean.
Move? You're alive. If you want, I can fly.
Well ... you were dead.
I will never doubt again.
Did you say, "I do"?
Then you're not married -- if you didn't say it, you didn't do it  -- wouldn't you agree, Your Highness?
Anybody want a peanut?
-- what? --
-- where?
But you don't know where he is.
What?
Because I can stop now if you want.
Sire.
My spy network has heard no such news.
Of course.
Not yet.
Hah?
Don't rush me, sonny. You rush a miracle man, you get rotten miracles. You got money?
Sheesh! I never worked for so little, except once, and that was a very noble cause. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           93.
That's very comforting. But I'm afraid you'll just have to wait.
No good. I've known too many Spaniards.
I ought to be after twenty years.
You know what a hurry we're in.
Oh, have it your way.
You only think I guessed wrong --  -- that's what's so funny! I switched glasses when your back was turned. You fool.
How do you do.  I mean ... Excuse me ... I mean ...
I'll wait in the hall ...
Ooooooops.
Where?  What?
I went to a Turkish bath, who cares? The show was a flop.  What difference does it make?
Why should they find out?  It's only two thousand dollars,  Bloom, do me a favor, move a few decimal points around.  You can do it. You're an accountant.  The word 'count' is part of your title.
It's not cheating ... It's charity. Bloom, look at me ... look at me! I'm drowning.  Other men sail through life.  Bialystock has struck a reef.  Bloom, I'm going under.  I am being sunk by a society that demands success, when all I can offer is failure.  Bloom, I'm reaching out to you.  Don't send me to jail.  Help!  Help!
Well, you know what they say, "Smile and the world smiles with you."  Heh, heh.  The man should be in a straight jacket.  Feeling better?
They certainly do.  They certainly do.  Come, let me take you to lunch.
Look, I'm just not wearing this arm band.  I don't care how big the deal is.
Ohhhhhhhhh, how I hate you.
It was the same thing in Germany. We looked for years before we found the right Hitler.
I can't.  I can't do it.  It's a demon.  It's a gargoyle, it's a monster... but it's still my child.
Good.  Let's fool around.  Now, I'll be the innocent little milk maid and you'll be the naughty stable boy.  Oh, this milk is so heavy.  I'll never reach the house.  Help.  Will someone help me?
We can't play today?
Oh, the best one.
Oh, Bialy, please, just a little. Just a little.
Stop!  Stop!  This is insanity.
What?
Wouldn't have been able to tail you if you did.
Caroline...? Mary still isn't in?
Buzz me the minute she comes in.
Can see you do. Sorry I couldn't make you feel better. You want to come to my office this afternoon and report a missing person... And the theft, is what you want to do!  Sooner you drop this thing in the lap of the law, that's the sooner you'll stand a chance of your sister bein' picked up. How about that?
Sam, I'm going.
I didn't. I got a job, too.  I wonder if that hurt her, my not letting her sacrifice for me?  Some people are so willing to suffer for you that they suffer more if you don't let them.
I could stand something regular.
I have?
Thank you. Again.
No.
I'd like to.
Now what?
He told you he wasn't coming right back cause he wanted to question Norman Bates' mother, right?
I didn't think so.
You must've seen an illusion, Sam. Now, I know you're not the seeing- illusion type... But no woman was illusion there and I don't believe in ghosts, so there it is!
No--I don't want to give any money. Everybody wants money--I'm not going to give any money.
Maybe you want my money, too.
You found Buckley?
Not so fast, Mrs. Buckley. That was your idea!
Joseph returns from the room where Gisle is. He has evidently succeeded in calming her. He goes and sits in the chair where Nikolas sat. He rests his head in his hand. He sees the open diary and begins reading it.
Joseph is reading the diary, which arouses his interest more and more. It is as if he finds a connection between what he reads and the fearful events that have taken place around him. An extract from the diary is shown.
Another fragment of the diary is shown [having to do with vampires].
She isn't anybody's friend, and I don't like you living with her. She's a bad influence.
What's nice about her? ... a hard-boiled little gold digger.
Well, I do say it.
Don't kid yourself -- she means it.
I'm not quarreling, only ...
What do you think I am?
It happens that I'm the law.
So you can give me an argument and tell me I'm wrong. Don't be sil, Kid.
He's not a stag hound. His name is Kelly and he's a police dog.
Plain-clothes man.  Come on, slaves, drink and be merry for tomorrow you might be appointed correspondent to Washington ... a fate worse than death.
Ain't that something. The mad monk of Manhattan. Here goes nothing.  Listen to the animal cracker roar like a lion.
Not even if it gives you a clean bill of health?
What! And let every rag in town grab a red-hot story? Not so you could notice it! Now, look, I want you to drive me around the corner and wait for me.
All right, brother. Then you can go to some nice warm place, and I don't mean California.
And you think I will permit this, my friend?
And they are welcome to them. To perpetuate such creatures is to celebrate their crimes.
You're insane.
Good. Well, I'll be seeing you.
They didn't have a leg to stand on. There's no case against me. It's a clumsy thing to have happen, but nothing to worry about.
Thanks.
It's an experiment.
So I can move on.  You too.
Buddy, you don't realize it but what you're doing isn't nice.
You don' t need to know that. It's none of your business.
Yeah.
Oh, Waski, you don't know anything.
All right, what do you know?
Daddy, what's the matter?
No.
You shouldn't watch such things, Doll.
Your wife and children are back in New Hampshire in the snow?
Well, well, well. So Miss Rosebud has arrived. Un-hmm. And you're all assembled here. Yes, indeed. Un hmmm.
What time is it?
Is she all right?
You don't like him because he's a Yankee. He's a brilliant doctor.
That's why I'm asking her who the father is. It's the most vital question of all. Who's the father, dear?
But she must know... unless... unless... Rose, was there more than one person?
Well, yes, she's happy. Of course Dave doesn't have her life force, not at all. There isn't much furniture in his house, just a table and one or two chairs, whereas Rose has furniture coming out of the windows.
Yes, I think so. He adores her, it's almost pitiful the way he worships her. I just hope she isn't too much for him.
Well, it has buttons.
That's all you've got to say, you've got a bad cold?
Mine.
Yes, mine. I'm going to have one.
Dave, you are as full of shit as a Christmas turkey and you know it. Now if you want to start a fight on this plane and get yourself in jail, go right ahead. But I am telling you, you are full of shit right up to your eyeballs.
Dave Schapiro is no horse doctor and Rose has been a good wife to him for a long time. To call her a nymphomaniac is the most stupid thing I ever heard in my life.
Yeah, it took her a while to grow up and find Mr. Right, but she did it. She found him.
Yeah, I remember it.
Let me be the judge of that, Madam.
Well, it's rather interesting about Brother, actually. I realized the remarkable thing he had when he was six weeks old. He looked at me and understood me, he knew exactly who I was. I know it sounds crazy but it's true. He's very remarkable, he was born for the ministry and could move millions, but he doesn't know that yet. I have to warn you about him, he can be very dangerous, there is an evil streak in him, a streak of pure sheer meanness. But at heart Brother is saintly and that is why he was born for the ministry even if he doesn't know it.
Rose, sit down in that chair and be quiet! We're trying to help you, you silly creature, sit in that chair!
Well... well, that's wonderful, Rose.
Hey, listen... I'll give you something else, Kittle.  Anything. Remember... remember that corpse washed up on Huntington Beach?  It was never identified...
Alright, wait... there's a dentist in Brentwood peddling morphine...
Again.
We catch 'em, I wanna be first to hurt 'em.  Promise me I get to go first.
It's personal.  We'll hook up at Billy-Boy's pad in an hour.  See ya then.
They shot us all, kid.
Same day as before.  I think.
It's go time, Billy-B.
If we don't catch a break soon, we're gonna be left standing with our dicks in our hands.
Where have you been?
It's our job.
Let's hope.
All for one...
See... now that we know you know, the hard part's done for us.
It's one of a kind.
I also thought he could be turned back to the good side. It couldn't be done. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil.
You cannot escape your destiny.
Vader humbled you when first you met him, Luke... but that experience was part of your training. It taught you, among other things, the value of patience. Had you not been so impatient to defeat Vader then, you could have finished your training here with Yoda. You would have been prepared.
Luke!
Fine. Together again, huh?
How are we doing?
That bad, huh? Where's Leia?
Come on, Artoo.  We'll need your scanners.
Ahhh...
Figured if I left you frozen like that you'd just give me bad luck the rest of my life, so I might as well get you unfrozen sooner or later.
Come on! Come on!
All right, Wedge. Go for the power regulator on the north tower.
I know. Somehow...I've always known.
No! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel your presence, then leave this place. I wish I could go with you.
But, why must you confront him?
Yes.
I know what you told me, Brad. But this Dr Everett Scott.  His name is not unknown to me.
And now he works for your Government, doesn't he, Brad?  He's attached to the Bureau of Investigation of that which you call U.F.O's.  Isn't he, Brad?
Hmmmm.  He'll be in the Zen Room.
Oh dear!  But then where did the motorcyclists come from?
It's alright Janet, we'll play along for now and pull out the aces when the time is right.
Yes, Dr Scott.  A laser capable of emitting a beam of pure anti-matter.
Like I'm outside in the rain
Free to try and find a game
Cards for sorrow, Cards for pain.
Ah - sweet Transexual - land of night - to sing and dance once more to your dark refrains.  To take that step to the right...
And our World will do the Time Warp again.
My mother told me just the opposite. She said, 'You weren't born with much of a body so you'd better develop your brain.'
They either say, 'Kill the nigger' or 'Hope you die, Honky.' -- What ya got in the bag?
Like it would make a difference if you were, right? This guy's a friend and now he's takin' ya out.
Ya, ya goin' outta the bedroom an' I don't wanna know from nothin'.
Hey, I want ya out instamaticly. -- I'm sicka lookin' at ya hangin' around like a friggin' spider -- Go out -- Live! Do, enjoy life.
Don't get wise with me. I want ya to stop bein' a loser.
Why?
...I don't feel heat from the name.
...It's very American.
...No wine -- Bad for ya' brain.
No wine.
Why?
No dollar.
Thank you, Bob. The electricity is everywhere tonight. Rocky Balboa, a fifty-to-one underdog, is living a Cinderella story which has captured peoples' imaginations all over the world -- to quote a popular sports magazine, 'The fighting style should be 'The Caveman Against the Cavalier.' From the increase in sound it appears the challenger is now approaching the ring... His record is forty-four wins, twenty losses and thirty-eight knockouts.
Bob.
Do I have to pay juice?
I won't.
Ya hope I don't keep acting like a whore or I'll turn into one, right?
Yeah.
Freak luck for sure.
Freak luck is a strange thing.
Whatta ya think that outfit cost?
'Bout what?
Maybe ya should see a doctor.
Maybe another job is the best thing.
Gazzo's gotta come to you.
Gazzo's gotta come to you -- Hey, Paulie, it's a bad job -- Do what you do now.
Whatta these guys want?
Yo, what's with you? -- It was suppose to be private.
Well, I'll be...
What are you complaining about?  Here's your fifty bucks.
Maybe Baby Herman was right.  Somebody wants Acme's property.  Cack the old man, pin it on Roger, and destroy the will.
They?
Surprised?
Don't worry, you're not the first.  We better get out of here.
That's how he gets rid of the troublemakers.  It's a combination of acetone, turpentine and paint remover. He calls it the...  Final Solution.
Valiant?  What're you doin' here?
I've already seen your photographs.
You idiot.  I lost the key for those cuffs.
But, Eddie, you know what happens when...
Yeah?
If you do, sir, I am for you.  I serve as good a man as you.
Uh? Uh?
I fear, too early: for my mind misgives Some consequence yet hanging in the stars Shall bitterly begin his fearful date With this night's revels and expire the term Of a despised life closed within my breast By some vile forfeit of untimely death. But He, that hath the steerage of my course, Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen.
And all this day an unaccustomed spirit lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts. I dreampt my lady came and found me dead and breathed such life with kisses in my lips that I revived and was an emperor. Ah me, how sweet is love itself possessed when but love's shadow's are so rich in joy. News from Verona. How now, Balthasar?! Dost thou not bring me letters from the Priest? How doth my lady? Is my Father well? How doth my lady Juliet? For nothing can be ill if she be well.
I am a-weary, give me leave awhile: Fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I!
What haste? can you not stay awhile? Do you not see that I am out of breath?
Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels all men's; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body,
Lord, how my head aches! what a head have I! O, my back! Other' other side,--O, my back.
Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I warrant, a virtuous,--Where is your mother?
O lady dear! Are you so hot? Henceforward do your messages yourself.
Have you got leave to go to confession to-day?
Then hie you hence to Father Laurence' cell; There stays a husband to make you a wife
Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.
Bid her to come to confession this afternoon; And there she shall at Father Laurence' cell Be shrived and married.
Finding this package is a thing easier said than done.  We don't even know what it is.  What did we steal?
When this whole thing started you made it clear: you're running the show.  And I don't believe you'd be running this show if you didn't know what was going on.
And I don't believe you...
Some places, not all.  Italy, for instance, they're serious about their food.  But try bloody Britain, anywhere in the U.K., you don't get much fancier than a deep-fried bar egg.  Food's not our thing, you see.
Best beer in the world known to man or God.
Budweiser?  You talk to me of beer and you've the unbridled gall to mention Budweiser in the same sentence?  That's not beer!  Christ, it's not even a poor excuse for rabbit piss.
I drink what every civilized man, woman and child in the world drinks: Guinness.
The two of you were supposed to go to a simple meet and come back with a simple piece of information, and instead you went to fucking war...
Come off it, Sam -- if we weren't friends already we wouldn't be here now, would we?
Not so fast.  Who's that?
Bad company...
He's a cop, Vincent, he's French and he's a cop and you better shoot him in the fucking head right now!
Figured enough to know there's an odd man out and I'm looking at him.
Yes, Sam's tough alright.
Of course.  Don't you?
Not exactly.
How did you know?
Gets the job done.
Not for long.
Is that right?
Why don't you go do better, then...
What makes you think we're here to meet you?
I have, I don't know, maybe a cigarette a week.
I do.
It has it's moments.  Course, you get cancer and die, that's the down side.
You were smoking?
Please, help yourself.  Smoke as many you'd like.
The address of the Russian production company.  Just in case we need to find them.
If I'm going to die for the CIA, I'm going to go out smoking.  Besides, there's half a forest between us and them, they can't see a goddamned thing.
Seamus Reilly.
I gotta try and overcharge him, he has to moan about the price, we settle somewhere in the middle.
Well I hope so.  That pretty much cleaned me out.
I hear you.
Maybe.  Who cares?
You're thinking about killing him.  I can't do that.  No way.  I've never killed a man.  Never even shot at one...
I...I can't do that.
That's not what I mean.
Listen.  Do you want to go to jail? Taking evidence, tampering with a crime scene.  You know what they'd do.
Exactly.  This is our little secret, partner.
I don't know!  Shit, give me a break!
I know, I know.  Dwayne's dead, but we can deal with it.  We'll pin it on him.  The DEA was driving Jesse's car. No car phone.  No radio.  They couldn't have called me in.
How much?
Two thousand...
You mean that guy was an agent?
Nothing.
Oh.  You coming by tonight?
Are you sure you're OK?
I'm just tired is all.  I'll see you tonight OK baby?
I love you too.
Well I was just throwing out ideas...
You didn't answer my question. Are you saying my word is of no value to you?
That's news to me.  So it's over at Jesse's office?
Excellent. I'll go down with you.
Is this marked money, or what?
I mean at least pick a more discreet place, the scalp, under the armpit, under the tongue, someplace where the trained eye wont immediately look.
I don't know...
Dwayne -
Well it's not here -- you're wasting your time and you're pissing me off!
Ah, hell I'll get one soon enough.  Besides, I want you to have it.
You've done without it long enough, ma.
How much is that?
Two-hundred thousand dollars?  Who wants a hundred dollars?
We need to get out of sight.  Come down to my suite.
So what's your story?
No.  It's my first time.
Are you kidding, they love me.  I'm a star, Lee.  A god to these people!
Over there -- that's Ricky Tan.
This is a very dangerous man.
I'm calling for back up!
You said --
What?
What is it?
I knew it.  What does she know.  You want me to sing something?
They'll probably torture us first, shock our privates, then put two bullets in our eyes and one in the back of the head.
Dancing?
It was Isabella.  She says the plates are in the soft count room.
Yes.
I guess so.  Thank you, Carter.
Excuse me?
I still have my lunch money from third grade.
Don't you remember?  I'm already dead.
That's cool.  We're gettin' to know each other. This is a good thing. I'm Carter.
Hey, that's whacked!  I thought we was gettin' on here!
OK. Say what it is.
Let me give you a piece of advice: never touch another man's radio. You do it again, nobody, not Rhonda, not Yolanda, gonna save your ass.
What is that, some kind of Chinese proverb?
Yes, I know this song.
Who does not know War?  War, hhh, Wo-ooh-wo-ooh-wo-oh.  What is it good for?  Absolutely nothing. Good-God, you all.
It ain't your ass, it's my ass you're backin' up.  Take the damn gun.
Where'd you get it?
It's called a dress.
Carter, shut up!
What are you talking about?
How did I do this?! Maybe you didn't notice but I'm in jail!
I understand, sir. But you are an honored guest of the United States...
I'm the town's unofficial fitness trainer.  Big advocate of the mind and body combining for success.  You could say or you can quote me, I'm a glass half full king of guy.
I'm happy here, where I'm supposed to be.  But if you ever become a Catholic, may I ask you a favor, Maggie?
Could your confess to Father Patrick from now on?
What?
Since when does Ellie need moral supp--
Then you'll be my best man.
Go talk to the pastor and he'll tell you what to do.  And someone will tell me what to do.
Are you a reporter?
Oh, yeah.  Scared the hell out of Skipper.
Despite what you think, I don't do it on purpose.  And I have no intention of doing it again.
Really.
Agreed.
Yes it is.  And it doesn't mean anything.
Me?
I didn't even need to change this gasket, just put in a little hydraulic fluid.
Lighten up, what?
I haven't seen him in twenty-four hours. It just gives me the creeps a little bit. I'd feel better if I knew where he was.
Just stop it.  Don't say another word like that.
No.  It's my life.
No, it's humiliating and you've been doing it since I was a kid.  I don't like it.  Stop.  You may not like having a daughter with problems.  But guess what?  I don't like having a father who's drunk all the time.  I'll eat in my room.
My head swells up like a watermelon and I drop dead.
Not for the kind of place I want to do.  I won't be in Chicago that long.
And then I'll see you in New York --
There's practically a whole book about how that statistic is not true --
I couldn't do it.  How did I get here?
I know.
I know. 
We'll move them --
The cabinets have to be redone --
I don't know.  When I met my wife, it was so clear.  I just <u>knew</u>.
Well, okay.  What's the big deal?  If she'll forget the new fireplace, I'll marry her. Just point me in the right direction.
It's a spice rack.
Thank God.  Something you don't know.  It's a single white female.
Oklahoma.  Do you know where that is?
I'm not going to think about what they're not teaching you in school.  I am not going to think about it.  Generally speaking I think we should rule out people who don't live somewhere near here --
Everyone thinks Brooks Robinson is the greatest.
Oh, right.
Who is Annie?
Hi.  He should book now because we can get an excursion fare. Jessica's parents are travel agents and --
What do you mean?
No. My name is Quintero. Mister Quintero.
Yeah.
No. No. I can't. If Ramn ever found me on a picket line ...
I see. The men. You'll strike, maybe, for your demands -- but what the wives want, that comes later, always later.
What has it got me, your union?
Over my dead body.
But it's yours. I won't let them ...
You weren't waiting for me.
Be still ...
Well, you're the organizer. You work out strike strategy -- and most of the time you're dead right. But when you figure everything the rank-and-file's to do down to the last detail, you don't give us anything to think about. You afraid we're too lazy to take initiative?
Maybe not. But there's another thing ... like when you came in tonight --  I heard you ask your wife, "Who's that? His grandfather?"
That's it?
No.
Nothing, I'm trying to remember...
Ouch.
This has nothing to do with him.
Yes. Why do you find that so hard to believe?
What is wrong with you?
They would have killed you too.
Billy Sutcliffe said he saw you at a bar down in Gardena a few weeks ago. Said you looked so bad, he barely recognized you.
Business.  I need to leave town and I find myself in dire need of some cash.
No  You think she's a tweaker?
When? When did you ever see me use?
You ever notice how I always showed up, in the middle of a binge? Left before it was over? How I sneak away for cap-naps? How when the crank came around to me, I always said I'd just done one?
Um, I think the Warren Commission has been closed for a while.
Big Bill
You go, boy.
When?
I'm afraid so, Danny.
Garcetti, you're teeth, they're fucking perfect.
Funny, I don't feel lucky.
What if he caps me before you can make a move?
What do you mean?
What is it, drugs?
The Army gave you that?
You must be a hell a shot.
Looks like a flaming asshole to me.
You didn't volunteer, Jackson.
White-walls?
A half-track, anything.
I'll tell you what, if I'm still alive when it hits five-hundred, I'll let you know and we'll split the money.
I don't expect to live that long.
I teach English at Addley High School in Addley, Pennsylvania.
That's not what we're here for.
Rolls to his feet.  FIRE another BURST.  KILLS the last of the German riflemen.  Doesn't pause.  RUNS onto the field.
Out of the mouth of babes.
Stands on the edge of the woods, almost in a trance.
Why's that?
Except for the last part, that one's not bad.
I don't like that one.
But we accomplish the mission.
Has anyone ever told you, you're officer material?
That's a mystery to me.
That's not where I am.  Miller No? Where are you?
Yes, sir.
...for you to blow up, yeah, yeah, we heard that.
What about you, Captain?
Oh yeah, let me give you another card.
The movies are a good second date, you know, as a date?
Yes I did- I sat across from her in a mall.  We ate together.  We ate, that's eating, sharing an important physical event.
What's a scam?
Lloyd, you have to understand her family is being ripped apart. Like you and she were ripped apart.  Like Joe and I were ripped apart.
I just saw Joe.  He's here.
Okay, I promise I will.  Just come here a minute, I want to show you something.
I knew how planes flew, but I was still a little nervous.
Well then don't pick it up. You know what's best.
Would you hold this for me?
Or, or I could always wear this one.
Yeah.
I'm doing alright.
Yeah?
Right.
Alright, high level air safety tips.  If anything happens, it'll usually be in the first five minutes of the flight, right?
So when you hear the smoking sign go 'ding', you know everything's going to be okay.
Right, I'm just going to keep talking until that ding happens, which is going to be soon.
Alright, personalised flight care from Corey.  Books, cassettes, magazines, anything?
Okay. She's really pretty great, isn't she?
She's really pretty great, isn't she?
Okay.  Good afternoon.  Goodbye.
How ya doin' Miss Evans?
No way.
What?
I love you too.
War.
We're going to be making so much money, none of this is going to matter -
Some of the boys went crazy, what're you going to do?  You're right, it's bad business, but it's over with, it's done.  Occasionally, sure, okay, you got to make an example.  But that's good business.
All you have to do is tell me what it's worth to you.  What's a person worth to you.
I don't know, ten or twelve.  That's a good color.  Dark blues, grays.
So I'll talk to him about it.
He's got no style, we all know that. So, we should hang him for it?
There's a machinist outside who'd like to thank you personally for giving him a job.
Yes.
He was a metal press operator, quite skilled.
Find me every variation of Himbry and what was the other name...
Who is this?
Someone who wants to talk to you.
Did you do it?
What's your subject?
Let us decide that.
It's under control.
I got it..
Page 41. "Deputy Dewey oozed with inexperience."
How do you know my dim-witted inexperience isn't merely a subtle form of manipulation used to lower people's expectations thereby enhancing my ability to effectively maneuver within any given situation?
C'mon. Let's go.
That's not the way we play the game.
What if your life depended on it?
I got. I got it. FRIDAY THE 13TH, PART 20.
Yeah, right.
Popcorn flies as Maureen falls forward, into the aisle, clutching her bloody stomach. She's speechless, unable to SCREAM. She holds her bloody hand out for all to see, begging for help. She stumbles down the aisle. Someone YELLS "Sit down." Maureen turns to several PEOPLE who begin to react. She turns behind her to see the Ghost Face coming at her again...knife raised.
The knife slices into Maureen again...then again. The theatre audience is starting to take note as the Ghost keeps slashing at her repeatedly with the knife. A horrifying, sickening sight.
..we only promote safe rubbered sex.
..harmonica style is okay.
We can still Sandra Bullock it.
Hello.
Who is this?
Does the name Maureen Prescott sound familiar to you?
Well can you tell me if the woman in this picture looks familiar to you.
But we know who killed Maureen Prescott, Billy Loomis and Stu Macher.  I mean, they even told Sidney how they did it!
That is for me to decide.  I need to talk to her Mr. Riley, she is a key element in this case.  I have a press conference in an hour, and I need to explain why there are four dead celebrities.
Mm, what a waste of Silicone.  What does my mother have to do with this all Dewey? We're a long way from Woodsboro.
Uh-huh. Another News clipping. Another one about Sid's mom. Dewey, whether we like it  or not it looks like we're going to have to  go back into our past.
This has everything to do with me Dewey. I was the one who brought the nation's attention to this shit anyway. I'll be damned if I'm gonna sit around and pass on the buck again.
Yes. Look, let's get something straight Dewey, I got into this shit cause the police came looking for ME. Not cause I'm out to make the SUNRISE STUDIOS SLASHINGS.
Again, I am the author of the definitive book on the Woodsboro murders.!  What about you?
You said you'd never leave Woodsboro, 'The only place that's real!'  But now you're here. Not with me.  Dewey, I took care of you.  I waited until you were well.  I couldn't stay there, I mean, it's like dog years, one year in Woodsboro is like seven everywhere else.
It was fucking '60 Minutes II'!  I couldn't say no!  I could've been the next Diane Sawyer!
It didn't work Dewey.  We tried,  we're different.
Dewey, you're not just here because of that second rate K-Mart, straight-to-video version of me, are you?
All of what Dewey?  You do know something, don't you?
Always.
And?
Someone stole Sid's file?
I'm sorry, this is too good!
Right. Sorry.  Do you think he did it? 
And who is that?
Sure, why not. You did Save my life,Mr. Rielly.
Oh shit it's my cell!
Oh come on! Why the hostility?
They're the ones who approved it.
All the nightmares. All the hell I went through was because of you, you spineless bastard!
Oh my God, Angie Crick? From English class?
Who is this?
No one's saying you did.
You know what time it is, Sid? It's after midnight. It's your mother's anniversary. We killed her exactly one year ago today.
No, I didn't. I didn't kill anyone, Sheriff.
It's okay. We need to talk.
Why? WHY? Did you hear that, Stu? I think she wants a motive. Hmmm... I don't really believe in motives, Sid. I mean, did Norman Bates have a motive?
You're making popcorn?
I only eat popcorn at the movies.
Really? What?
Do you like scary movies?
What's your favorite scary movie?
TO SEE WHAT YOUR INSIDES LOOK LIKE.
Come on, yes you do.
I know who you are, ma'am. How's the eye?
Well... uh... yes ma'am. For the time being.
Sidney's father?
You're sure it was the Hilton?
He's not registered. Could he have gone to another hotel?
We'll find him, Sid. Don't worry.
What about the cellular phone bill?
Twenty years ago I woulda said not a chance. But these kids today... damn if I know.
Jesus! The camera-hurry!
I owe you shit.
That is so unoriginal. You disappoint me, Randy.
So who are you?
So where are you?
She's the Scream Queen.
And what would be your motive?
Are you serious?
It's past seven.
I'm not worried.
Whatever. Just hurry.
I don't know...
I don't know, they just did.
What about the trace on his bank account and the guns?  There must be something to connect him with a past.
I thought you might want to be filled in.
Yeah.
Who tied her down?  You or him?
You'll see.
Because I envy your normal life.  Envy is my sin.
No.
Good.
I made a decision, because I have to consider the integrity of the scene.  I can't worry whether you think you're getting enough time on the playing field.
What?
Punishing.
Like in the Parson's Tale, and Dante.
Yeah.  Parts of them.  Anyway, in Purgatory, Dante and his buddy are climbing up that big mountain... seeing all these other guys who sinned...
Right.  But there, pride comes first, not gluttony.  The sins are in a different order.
Forced what?
Like, because someone's holding a gun on you.
No.
They pay cops for the inside scoop, and they pay well.
Oh, it's alright.
It's not what you think it is.
That is.
Saint Thomas Aquinas.  He wrote about the seven deadly sins.
I'm trying, alright?  Just tell me what we've got.
Big surprise.
Don't do this... please...
It surprises me.  It really does.
Crime of passion.
This is a done deal.  All but the paperwork.
Stealing the cattle was just to pull us out...This here's a murder raid...  It shapes up to scald out either your place...or my brother's.
Dunno...Seems so.
I thought we were trying to get the girls back -- <U>alive</U>...We jump those Comanches, they'll kill 'em...You know that!
Now mount up, son...
We ain't goin'! We ain't goin' without you, Debbie...Ethan, get the horses...I'll try to keep her talkin'...
A young buck fetched it in late last summer...  Said it belonged to a captive chile of Chief Scar...
Me neither...But this buck claimed he was a big war chief with the Nawyecky Comanches.
Scar's band was headin' north...to winter in at Fort Wingate...eatin' agency beef. That's what this buck said...Maybe he lied.
In that case you won't find her -- and I won't get my thousand dollars.
Why, sure, Ethan...There's just the one thing we're after...finding Deborah and Lucy...
I ain't stayin'...I set out lookin' for Debbie...I aim to keep on...
Because she's my...my...
I always felt like she was...Her folks takin' me in, raisin' me like one of their own...
All right...I ain't got no kin... I'm goin' to keep lookin' that's all.
Cut it out, will ya...
Never heard of him...
You don't remember it, but I remember. That was your mother's scalp!
Yours truly...  And he even has to write his full name...Martin Pauley...not even just <U>Martie</U>!...  I don't care if he <U>never</U> comes back!
Come on, say it.  You know...
In the cellar, I think. Wait, I'll take care of it.
You know, it's not always easy for me, either.  But at least I try not to give in to each and every neurosis.
What? What am I supposed to sense?
We loved each other once.  Have you forgotten that?
Thank you.  Elisabeth, I didn't mean to...
I've killed my husband!
I think I've killed him.  Martin, my husband, I've killed him!  That is, I'm not sure, but...
I wonder how you guys figure on renovating this whole place.  You can afford to spend some money.  If I was you, I'd spare myself all the hard work.  Besides, didn't you want to start writing again?
Sir Robert De Lesseps.
Done.
Two weeks, three at the most, Aaaagh! For pity's sake.
Sad and wonderful! I have a blue velvet cap which will do well, I have seen apothecary with a cap just so.
Is it about a pirate's daughter?
What do we do now?
Go on.
How will it?
Thank you. Let go, there's a good nurse.
Why, Lord Wessex! Lost your wife so soon?
"Ay me."
Who is there?
Yes, some of it is speakable.
"I have more care to stay than will to go. Come death, and welcome. Juliet wills it so. How is't my soul? Let's talk. It is not day."
It is not my riding day, my lord.
I am going to church.
It is to be expected on a Sunday.
Mourning? Who is dead, my lord?
By coveting my property. I cannot shed blood in her house but I will cut your throat anon. You have a name?
About what?
I don't have time.
I don't have time to discuss it now. I don't care so long as he's not a freak.
Look, if I draw the short straw, then I'll do it, but I'm not going to do it just because you won't.
No, it doesn't. I tried to let it worry me but it won't. I've worked on that paper for three years. There is a pensioner's terror ordeal on page six every day. Every day. Maybe when I'm a pensioner it'll worry me.
I bought the tickets. One for her and one for me. It was my idea.
Cameron?
Really?
Alex.
OK.
He's right. You'd feel much better about it.
Yes, of course. Why wouldn't I be?
What about?
Burglary?
Of course.
Keep it going, Alex. You're unstoppable now.
It was on the television.
Well, I've been away for a bit, travelling, that sort of thing, and now I'm trying to write a novel.
A priest who dies.
Yeah. Well, maybe I'll change it.
Yes, I mean, who wants to read about another dead priest? It's about some other guy, some guy who's not a priest, who doesn't die. You see, it's better already.
It's a breeze.
One other thing. Do you have any tattoos?
What do you expect me to do about it?
Why would I like to know if there's nothing I can do about it, goddammit --
You're very rude... if you don't come back --
I don't want to see you anymore.
Hello, George.
Hello.
Right.
Great.
She is.
Great.
Right.
Right, that's right.
Well, yeah... you know.
Oh, about six weeks now... Lester -- well, he's very sweet.
He's a very private person, actually.
Why not?
I know... you don't know, I know.
Fuckin' A --
-- we are?
Why?
She's heavy.  See, Norman expects me to get in here, take care of all the customers and then do his show out in Norwalk. I gotta have my own shop, just out of self defense.
Hey, baby, what's happening?
Great, great. I hope you make it.
We live together now.
-- Sure.
Where's your car?
Who?
A business meeting, I told you that.
Oh, Christ.
-- A wash and set.
No?
But Mr. Norman said --
I just needed a wash and set, a wash and set, that's all.
When?
Isn't that bad for it?
Oh yeah...
I don't either, Lester, I swear to you I don't.
What about her?
Lester, it just happened.
No --
No, man, no. You can say everybody's a whore. She's okay. I mean Jackie'll fuck around but not that much. Somewhere she really likes you, Lester, and it's not just the bread. She's okay.
Then you were talking to him.
Aren't you going to have one?
Why not?
So what's your point?
I know, I'm sorry.
George is great but I know what you mean.
I guess not.
Getting your hair done...  Would you like to go to a party?
Those Arabs won't be when they start chasing you around the sand dunes.
-- just before I ask you out? I can't do that. Let's get out of here before good old Les catches up with us again.
John...
Come here for a minute, first.
Yeah.
Do you really want to go and live in that hotel for the winter?
Yeah, I guess so.  Anyway, there's hardly anybody to play with around here.
Yeah.
No.
No.
Yes.
Did Tony's first appearance happen to coincide with your arrival here?
And, er... where are they now?
Hallo, this is Dick Halloran again. I called a while ago about the folks at the Overlook Hotel.
Pleased to meet you.
It's not a matter that concerns you, Mr. Torrance - at least not at this point.
Yeah... that's all it is.
Good.
Oh Jack, what are you talking about?
Yes?
Oh, well - come on in Jack.
shut in together over long periods of time.
Oh!
Eight thirty.
A new pair of panty hose. Is it enough?
It was Brady's idea, Jane. Honest to God. Please take the money. I want to make up.
Hey, take it easy. I know how you feel.
She and dad are out back lighting the barbecue. Jane's walking around like she's King Shit of Turd Mountain. Like always.
I told you!
See me around to my car, Marty, and make sure I stay out of trouble at least that long.
BY A VOICE YOU HEAR FROM ON HIGH
LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED
LET THY SOUL BE HEALED
You ain't got nothin' I ain't seen.
Yes?
Is that why you came up here, Christy? To thank me?
And to say you're sorry.  About this afternoon.  And the things you said. Forgotten.  Completely.  Do you understand?  Forgotten.
Oh, right.  At my old place, we used to... wash cars.  Groom dogs.  So... nice loom.
Just about.  Show me again.
And we know that, even though most people would call you a leech and a parasite, the lowest slug of humanity! We know that deep down inside, you're probably even worse.  And so you truly need our prayers.
Free-lance?  Oh really?  You think I don't see?  You think I took vows yesterday?  I know what you're up to. You and Reverend Mother.
You're a ringer.  She brought you in to replace me.  Out with the old.
You know?  About me?  About everything?
Of course!  We must do it!  It's the will of God!  What is it?
Are you sure?
Mary Clarence!
They're from my old convent.
Before we do, you might like to freshen up.  And you'll certainly want to change
Our lives are simple.  We have little need for material possessions.
Useless distractions.
And whom would you call?
Your cell is more than adequate.
It is nine p.m.  Pleasant dreams.
I'm sure.  If I were you, I would use this time, to think about my life.  And its direction.  Or lack thereof.
From all I've heard, just about everything.  Your singing career seems all but nonexistent, and your married lover wants you dead. 
No.  No.
Not the choir, please, anything but that.  The choir -- I mean, have you heard them?  I'll do anything, scrub floors, toilets, you name it, but not that I
Very well.  I hold you responsible for all of this, For introducing a lounge act into my convent.  For utterly disrupting our way of life.  And for placing all of us in mortal danger.  Thank-you.
Safest place in the world.  You think Vince would look for you here?
Just remember - you're a target.  Don't you think Vince has a T.V.?
They open a window.
It didn't happen.
Yeah, right -- when I see it.
That should have tipped us.
Really, Mary Clarence?  Were you a choirmistress?
She wasn't a nun?
Yes?
Find 'em!
Two days... ?  For murder?
Would you stay, doctor?  I may need assistance.
When a goblin leaps from the nether world, others follow.  Poltergeists of the air, water and earth follow and cheer his desecrations!
Chosen me?
Not for lack of trying.
I shall, gladly.
No, you listen!  You may think we are a pack of superstitious dullards...
Father said witches live there.
Because, I serve a fine purpose alive. It is perfection for our murderer if I return to New York City with nothing more than tales of a galloping ghoul.  We must uncover the reason these victims were targeted.  What was taken from them... other than their lives? Who benefits by their deaths?
Nothing.  To hell with this place and all the people here.
Extra ordinary, yes.  But first, you tell me about the Headless Horseman.
If it had been surgery on a living person, done to save that person's life, you would not question it.  Not for a moment.  So, let me be the first to tell you, dear girl... on the other side of these sheltering mountains, a whole world has advanced beyond such plebeian thinking as yours.  And someday, no matter how much you fear it, that world will come to roust Sleepy Hollow out of its slumber.
Come with me.
Yes, actually.
Do you know... I think those are the first words I have heard from you my entire time here.
You are from the Hollow?
Wait up, I'll leave with you and lock up.
Good to see you, Bill. How's everybody doin'?
No, don't guess I do.  Scooter, good to meet you.  This is him, the one I talked to you about on the phone. Now like I said, I'll understand if you get nervous about it. I'm not gonna lie to you now, he did get in that trouble but then he was real young.
They was a boy. We made friends.
It's too big.
Don't say nothin' about that boy.
This is not your house, Doyle. This is my house and I'll say who stays and goes. You've got a house, why don't you go get one of your girlfriends and go home to it.
Goddamnit, I'm talkin' to the man. You set right there, Karl.
Come on, don't be a pussy. Everybody has to work.
Childers.
I don't want to worry your mama with company.
I was kindly needin' to do some tradin'. Reckon they sell toothpaste?
Them boys was tryin' to pull me down pretty hard.
I'm glad of it, honey.
I ain't got no boy.
I ain't got no boy.
I'll be dog.
I reckon not.
Not funny, ha, ha, funny queer.
I've heard it said that way.
I wouldn't never hurt them.
That's very sweet of you Vaughan. We care about you, too. Don't we y'all?
Wonderful. When your next book is published, maybe you could come into the store and do a signing. I'm sure we could get a lot of people to show up.
Huh?
For me?  I'll have the same thing. 
What's that, Sol?
What's the difference?
Uh, sure, Sol. Anything you say. Instead of saying, "One corned beef sandwich," and then, "Another corned beef sandwich," I'll say, "Two corned beef sandwiches."
Yeah, well, I'm sorry too.  It took me three years to save up those five thousand bucks, and now I'm broke. I can't hardly pay for this beer. Not to speak of having my credibility destroyed. Do you understand what I'm saying? My credibility. So yeah, I'm sorry, too. About as sorry as I've ever been in my whole fucking life.
If he's got something to tell me, why don't he tell it to me himself?
You got it.
Why don't you open it and find out?
Five thousand bucks.
It's all yours, baby.
For keeps.
Good, Auggie. Real good.  All finished.
Huh?
I just do what you tell me, Auggie. You tell me to sweep, so I sweep.
And this one, in case you haven't guessed, is Junior.
Say hi to Paul.
Jesus, Tommy, it ain't science, you know. You got your good trades and your bad trades. That's how it works.
What time is it?
Eight-thirty?
His only copy?
Nice try. You had me going for a second, but no ... no writer would ever do a thing like that.  Would he?
Now ask him who his mother was.
No, but as I say, the type is rare. Ten percent of Caucasian males.
That's obvious.
Unwritten rule of the sea.  We don't bother each other, stick to ourselves. Ask anybody.
Up in the air?  Was <u>that</u> your reaction?
Well, I don't do it for just anybody.
You've been busy with that trial, I suppose.  Such a travesty...
You bet.  And if Miyamoto there had been in a hurry to cast off, he coulda left this line behind on Carl's boat.
Pretty darn clear.
Twelve.
Actually, she said you had decided. Decided <u>not</u> not come forward.
No, night of the 16th, morning the 17th.  We replaced two guys named Miller and Milholland.
Yes, he was.
You ever been strangled by a single hand?
Sure.  I could take a fishing gaff and split your head open. Right above your left ear.
It is.
He's done some on-the-spot refit- ting.  You could see the side flange was banged away to make room for the D-6.
It was dead.  We had it tested. Maybe the D-6 was the spare and he had to use it.
But you are <u>certain</u> that he died by drowning.
Spirit?                          Oh!  You mean "AQ"..."aggressive qualities"?
Fresh!
Me and Tiny, we had them cornered - but we lost 'em in the shuffle.
It's twelve bucks.  We can get one of the overcoats out of hock.
What are you afraid of?  Nobody's asking you to have a baby.  This is just to get out of town. The minute we hit Florida, we'll blow this set-up.
Oh, you don't have to worry about that.
Daphne -  Go on - tell me all about him.
Get it while you're young.  And you better fix your lips.  You want to look nice for Osgood, don't you?
First thing we got to do is get out of these clothes.
I wanted to thank you for covering for me. You're a real pal.
If it hadn't been for you, they would have kicked me off the train.  I'd be out there in the middle of nowhere, sitting on my ukulele.
If there's anything I can do for you -
A bunch of us girls are going for a swim. Want to come along?
Oh yes, we do!
Oh - those.  I don't know.  Mice?
Personally, I'm Type O.
You don't say.
You invest in shows?
You're not sure?
I'm not surprised.
Well, pull in your reel, Mr. Fielding. You're barking up the wrong fish.
Well, it is to me.  Will you give her a message?  I'd like her to have a little supper with me on my yacht after the show tonight.
Nellie, get me long distance.  What is it?
Where did he conduct?
Oh.
I'll bet there isn't one of them under seventy-five.
Oh, I didn't hear you come in.
Looks like they're on the wrong track.
It's not how long it takes - it's who's taking you.
What is it?
All right - if you insist.
From a rich millionaire.
Me?
Booze.
Coffee?
Make is Scotch.  A demitasse. With a little soda on the side.
So now I got all those coffins on my hands - and I hate to see them go to waste.
Are you sure youre okay?
I knew you were still seeing someone else when we finally got together. I never in a million years would have dreamt it was Jeffrey.
Um, just about everyone.
Doesnt look like nothing.
Um, news flash: I dont give a shit.
You have feet?
On the nose.  I tell you what, because youre so cute, Ill take care of our incidentals.
Great, with the occasional stabs of shame. Now, listen, this covers the weekend, but as we discussed, if you want to be intimate, we talk money before anything happens.
Its okay. Hell, Ive never paid for it. But please dont feel like you have to explain yourself to me.
Oh, no.
Show me.
So, whyd you say yes to me?
Desperation?
What?! No, no. You cant--
Hi, kiddo.
At least somebodys using the damn thing.  I was gonna fix her up but we took one trip and the kids fought so much, we never launched her again.
Where is Africa, Miss Johnson?
Yes mam...
What do I tell my mama when I get home? I didn't find him and that's what I wanted to do.
But where is my daddy!?
Nothin'...
Yes, mam...
What do that mean?
You oughta be tired, too, Sounder. That possum shore whipped the hell outta you tonight!
Got it hurt in a dynamite blast, son. The dirty dogs had no more use for me, so they let me have time off my sentence, and let me come home.
You won't be goin' to jail again, will you, Daddy?
Yes, David...
Nobody yet -- it's all tied up.
No, ma'am...  Mama, I wanted Mrs. Boatwright to find out where Daddy is, so me and Sounder can go see him.
I can do it, Mama -- you know that. In the Bible stories you read to us, everybody's always goin' on a long journey. Jacob goes into a strange land where his uncle is and he don't even know where he lives, but he finds him. Everybody finds what they supposed to find.
Mama, don't I always do what you say -- every time I go to the fields to plant the corn, to Miss Boatwright's and the woods -- you tell me what to do and I do it, and you don't worry.
Come in, children.
Any time it's Saturday and I don't hafta do any work, I'm doin' okay!
Seems this piece of mail came to Mr. Howard's place this mornin' and he had me to bring it over here.
Don't belong to you! It's for the little important man, here!
The boy is hungry, Rebecca.
To the commissary to get this boy some clothes! I'm gon' get everybody somethin'!
Don't tell me nothin' 'bout what we owe ol' man Howard! I'll do the owing, and let him worry 'bout the collecting! Come on, David Lee!
Fragile?
Very funny!
You bet your fucking ass it was!
What?
Oh yeah?!  Well you're a monkey-shit-
No you can't Kenny!
Okay Kenny, I'll bet you a HUNDRED DOLLARS you can't light a fart on fire!
Eric, that is not appropriate.
Mkay, you see, children. This is exactly what I'm talking about. We have to change the way you think.
I don't know.
This will be very dangerous... Are you quite sure?
Then move out of the way.
KYLE BROVLOFSKI, YOU WATCH YOUR LANGUAGE!!
Oh... Alright, back you go.
YOU BASTARD!!
Yeah, they suck.
Are you sure, Kenny?
As Commander in chief, I have ordered our Army to set up defensive positions along the US-Canada border in anticipation of an attack.
Huh?
Oh, uh...  I don't know if air strikes are necessary.
This is NOT a place for fun and games! This is rehabilitation! Now GET TO IT!! We at MAC have a trial to go to!
Hello, Brooke Shields!
Terrance! NO!
I know.
THAT'S IT!  I HAVE HAD ENOUGH!!!!
Sure, Stan! How did you know I loved ice cream?
Wow, I have a clitoris too.
Oh yeah...
Oh Sara...
Anna...
I am here to provide service to... to all our guests.  There is a high level of passenger dissatisfaction. It is my duty...to report this.
Trust me.  Even checked 'em with my own eyes.
Transmit the code 3 emergency and take us offline.  Override the airlock sensors and hurry!  We're running out of time, we have to get to the pods!
What are you talking about! Can you transmit the code 3 -
Oh you'll get it, believe me.  So I'll see you in a few.
Don't say that!  It ain't over till it's over!
It depends on the condition of the ship.  If I could get to one of the suit compartments I could check the exterior air locks for a possible entry.
With what?  How am I going to interface with it?  I need to be able to talk to the system and to have the system talk to me.
I understand.
It was no time to lose my partner. We're going to have to hurry, he's on to us.
I'm about to blow the wall.
How does the distress signal look?
Congratulations on your...recent award.
Is there anything I can help you with?
Well, there's no better to way to see the world, than with us.
Well if you need anything, please feel free to ask me.  Just a reminder we have fabulous cuisine available 24 hours in the earthrise room, and a large selection of vintage wines here in our ship bar.
Well what would you know about it? You don't have anything to lose.
Yes.  You can enjoy some wonderful views from there.
Whoa, cool your maples. Over the bridge, past the Peter Pan, last house on the dead end. Theo releases Sid's hand. Sid drops to his knees and cradles his damaged hand.
It belonged to my dad.
When you get a chance.
Kastle's daughter's been lookin' for you.
They suspended me for 100 years.
I can appeal in five. I was hoping you could help me Mr. Fazeli.
I need a sponsor to get my sanction card back. Where I come from, you're the king.
I've never had orange whips, I'm from Akron.
The small ball.
Not for me. Miniature golf's for pansies.
Maybe I could bowl in Japan.
Clam it!
Do you have to get your hooks into every guy I'm interested in?
That's right, didn't you have a slight control problem in a recent tournament,champ?  Now go take out your "big four", darling.  Come on, we're making her nervous.
Bowling "Center"!
Mine, and they never tip.
It's been awhile. She didn't want me looking for my dad.
So why do you stay?
I bet you get to meet a lot of eligible bowlers.
I may not be a pro bowler, but I'm no amateur man. Sheila moves closer to Theo.
More than you could afford.
I could let them go for ten.
If you want a professional man, you have to be willing to pay for him.
When I'm with you Sheila, I don't even think about bowling. Theo takes Sheila in his arms and kisses her passionately. She stops him and looks around nervously.
I killed him once, I'll just have to kill him again.
At least I'll die smiling.
So, Buzz was stooling for you guys.
Back away then.
I said back away.
You're a fucking biochemist, aren't you?  Can't you tell us something.
Pull it, damn it!
Geologists?
-- Wait a second --
Hold on --
-- there's got to be some mistake here -- a four hundred year old military spacecraft?  There's no such thing... our space program isn't even forty years old.
It's impossible.
I told you people, nobody goes anywhere unless I say.
No "buts".  If he wants to be left, we'll leave him.  Hello?  Yes, the subs -- I want a report...  Hello...  Yes, a report. Gimme... shit.
You see the lever on the green box? Upper right hand corner?
Well, where the fuck is he?
It's nonsense.  There's enough difference between our own species to prove that.
She's not gonna know.
If the technology of that sphere is advanced enough -- the way it functions is gonna appear to us like magic.
What would we be working on in the future that would make us want to come back?
Don't make stuff up, these emotional theories, just so you can feel important here.
Disrupt our brain waves, interfere with our ability to think.
You did, didn't you?
You bastard.
I think so, Beth.  Yes.
Valdomet.
Sintag.
Does it cause drowsiness?  That's all we need.  To get him unconscious -- put him under.
Tarazine?
Bingo.
You think I'd really drink that?
You put explosives around the habitat, I can't imagine what you'd put in a drink.
Stop what?  Don't blame me.  It's not me.
I'm a woman.  I don't theorize.  I only deal with facts.
In time for what?
Just in time for what?
To what?
What are you still doing here?
You were all supposed to leave.  You weren't supposed to stay down here.
You don't understand about the sphere.
Stop what?  What are you -- ?
I'm trying to keep balance with --
Just pull her -- down like inside -- Harry, work with me here!
You got her?
Gimme some room here, will you?  Back off.  Gimme some space.
It's not a discharge.  Right, Edmunds?  You said before, right?  So it's gotta be a message.
No, they didn't say --
Sure, why not.  Give him the trophy. That pretentious son of a bitch.  You heard him, Norman.  All that "someone went to a lot of trouble, try again" bullshit.  And "impotent".  Where does he get off saying I'm impotent?  He's a fucking self-righteous, little prick.
You might get your stuff together. We'll be coming up on Organa Major soon.
Is that good or bad?
I know that.
You could put it that way.
I know your intentions.  I probably know much more about you than you realize.  In many ways you're a lot like your father.  He was an indulgent man, but a clever warrior.  Now what brings you out here?
I rarely use it any more.  I have the Force.  The Force is more powerful than any pistol.  You shouldn't put too much faith in that weapon.  Work on becoming aware of the Force... learn to feel its presence within you.  Try to sense what it's telling you.  It's the only thing you can rely on.
All you have to do is lose your thinking self.  Don't focus on anything.  Let your body do your thinking... You have to learn to act on what you feel, not what you think ... If I had the crystal, it would be much easier.  You could feel the Force immediately... but for now, let yourself go.  You'll pick it up... and someday you'll have no need for that pistol either.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.  I was considered one of the best bush pilots on Sullust. I've also had six hours on the T-2.
Then I think we're due the reward you offered... and it had better be substantial after what we've been through.
What's that little 'droid' carrying that's so blasted important?
We captured the plans in a raid on the Imperial shipyards, but we fell under attack before I could get the data to safety, so I hid it in this Artoo unit and sent him off.
The fourth moon of Yavin.  I've given the coordinates to Chewbacca.
All right, all right! You've got a ship!  But where do we go from here?  They probably took her to find the hidden bases... I don't see how we can find the rebels before she breaks.  The Empire has already beat us out.
Come back here... Where are you going?
He'll be well cared for.
Send feed-back into the control sensors in that Detention block.
What do I want with a scar ?
You heard the Lieutenant ! On the bounce, troopers !
Passport to the Universe. Who wouldn't want that ?
Your father will never let you.
Only 1 in 14 male applicants make it through stellar navigation. So what do you think your chances are ?
If you can't do those numbers, you haven't got a chance.
Love... how excruciatingly pathetic. Now try and pay attention.
Yeah, we know each other from the game. No hard feeling, eh, chum ?
THERE ! GRAVITY FIELD... IT'S BIG !
It wasn't luck. Rico ignored the mission objective to rescue you...
Aw, you're in love with me... You just dont know it yet.
Did you get Starside R&D ?
What do you think ? Everyone did it when we got our wings. You don't like it, do you ?
Up. We gotta be near A Company by now.
Trajectory indicates it came out of the Arachnid Quarantine Zone.
I don't stay where I'm not wanted.
Hey, they humiliated me in front of everyone ! I'm just supposed to take it, huh ? Well, I'm not gonna, and I guess that proves I just can't cut it.
A year at Harvard and you'll  see this "Federal Service" is just menial training for inferior people so they can call themselves "citizens" and take airs for the rest of their lives.
I won't quit !
I'm not going on vacation ! I want to be acitizen ! It's my decision. I made it.
He was a teacher , kind of a know it all... Always had this little smile.
Must fill your bottle up real quick when your wife and kids get smeared.
Hi, mom.
I'm gonna save Carmen.
Yeah, that's right.
Kill the bitch.
Give'em hell, sir !
V'ger will comply if the carbon units disclose the information.
It will... take me from <U>you</U>...
None available, Captain. There's no one in fact, who's fully rated on this design.
How do you define <U>unwarranted</U>, <U>mister</U>?!
This served the purpose.
Unidentified small object has been pulled into the wormhole with us, Captain! Directly ahead...!
Opinion, Mister. Spock?
Thrusters at station keeping...
And whatever you sensed out here....
Transmit image of the Alien to Starfleet; advise we are attempting further communication.
A life form of its own; a conscious, living entity.
Yes, Captain. It needed our mortality, the fear of it, our struggle against it, our fears, our dreams...
I prefer your poet Dante's phrase -- 'the divine restlessness of the human spirit.'
Tractor beam remains constant...
You quit.
Why did you quit?
Don't be so hard on yourself.
Well.  Everybody has reversals.  If you were never down how would you know when you were up?
It's in your play.
That's what the swing is <u>there</u> for...
Cast stood me up.
They're all preparing for the auditions - your movie.
Oh.  That's alright.  Then I'll come back at a better time.  What would be a better time?
Then I'll come back, then.
No, I just broke up with him.  I'll see you tomorrow.
...how <u>else</u> can you talk?
No.  You, I told them, you can't betray with the picture what you're saying with the words.  And, I don't know, the movies, I don't know.  They should be socially uplifting, why does she have to show her br...what is this...?
I saw...
Doug, this is Joe White, and this is, this, this is my fiance, Doug Mac...
Hold court, they have to, science lab, the high school.
You told me that about the <u>last</u> town.
I'm bleeding, Bill, I'm <u>bleeding</u>...
What, what, what, what do they got that can pass for the Old Mill...
What'll I do for fun?
I <u>know</u> my lines...
I swear that that woman in my room...
No, wait a, wait a, wait a...we can't put her in the car, she gets it in her head to sue, or rape, or some goddam, she wasn't in...
I wasn't in the car.
I just...
...yes...
Yes.
We, we have to give it.
I, uh...I'm leaving.
I perjured myself.  I told a lie, and I ruined my life. That's what I did...  I don't suppose you could help me with <u>that</u>, could you?  Turn back the <u>clock</u>, or something?  Give me back my, give me back my <u>purity</u>, I don't suppose you could just wave your magic wand and do that, could you...?  But what <u>is</u> truth? Eh?  In't that the thing?  What <u>is</u> true?
Eight hundred thousand dollars in cash.
Get Mitch Cohn on the phone in New York, tell him she's breaking her contract and we're very up...
We're very upset with her.  Get someone to <u>double for her</u>, her tits, the tits scene, call L.A.  I want to see some <u>pictures</u> of the women's <u>tits</u>.  Of their <u>tits</u>.
You're very sorry, you passive aggressive, son-of-a-bitch...can we replace him?
Where have you been...?
I...
That's why I <u>want</u> it.  Type it up and get it back to me in...
...not the Lazyboy...
Mmm...
I have to work on my video project! Don't follow me!  I can put myself to bed.
It happens.
That will never happen.
No I'm not.  I don't care.  Why should I care?  I mean nobody asked me when you got divorced.  Nobody asked me if I wanted a new mother.  Nobody even asked me if I like her.  If you guys don't care about our family staying together, why sh...
THEN TURN OFF THE CARTOON!
Mom?  What's wrong?
Don't touch me!  I'm <u>allergic</u> to you!
That's so weak.
Honey, she won't d...
Ice cold water.
Hello?...Duncan...The Ad Agency's already there?...I'm out the door...  Ben!  Knock it off!  It's gonna go beautifully...  Damn it Ben --
IT'S YOUR GIRLFRIEND, BIG GUY, OPEN UP.
Yes.
I did.  Do I have to eat lamb? Daddy didn't cook it, she did.
No!  I have to get there.
Before you.
Heaven.  I have to tell him he's made a mistake.  He should take Grammy Martha first.  Or Grandpa Norman.
You've got a fruit loop in your hair.
I once threw an entire bowl of jello on my stepmother's head --
Actually, never.  They'll always hate you.  There's a gene for it.
Look, I will <u>send</u> a P.A. to pick up the children.  There are <u>agencies</u> that supply sitters, nannies...
Do you realize what could have hap- pened to your son today?  How lucky we are the police found him before some lunatic did?  He could have been...
Not to me.
I'm not gonna wait around to see the next one.  I'm not gonna watch my kids fall through the cracks of this arrangement.  I'm seeing a lawyer.
We've broken a lot of promises, haven't we Luke?
Remember when Mommy and Daddy got divorced?
I'm sure that didn't upset her. Everyone in our family takes showers.
I did it for her.
Let's...hold up for a bit.  It may not happen.  Our secret, okay?
You are <u>marrying</u> the <u>greatest</u> guy who walks this <u>earth</u>.  Who I have <u>loved</u> from my <u>heart</u> for twelve<u>years</u>!
It's a mess, right now.  That's my project when I get back.
No.
It doesn't matter, I didn't tell h...
Give 'em my number.
Double.
Just sit me up.  Nice and tall. Bring Benjamin first.
Okay...Is that the good thing or the bad thing?
What do you call it?  You told her you had doubts.
What?
Man, I am out of here! This family is so fucked!
I did not go to high school.
We had to work. My family was poor.
I'm still poor.
No, Mikey.
I'm always working.
This is work.
Got a lot of homework?
Fine.
What's tomorrow?
I have a cousin. Very big giver to the alumni fund.
Maybe he's building a bomb...just like-!
Thank you.  So Catherine seems like she might become a really good writer.
Yeah...um...so anyway, tell me. What about you? I'd heard through the grapevine you were producing movies.
Oh. Tired of 'life in the fast lane'?
I dunno. I'd like to be good at something. It doesn't have to be TV. I mean, it could be movies...Anything. I'd be willing to direct.
Just the soda, please. Cooper heads down the hall.  Filmore watches him leave, sighs, then turns and smiles at the General manager:
Used to Filmore, used to.
Hey now!  No cussing on TV!  Well in closing I'd like to say that there are two reasons to have that money outside in an hour.  One is my perky co-anchor here, and the second is the lives of tens of thousands of people--people just like you and me!
He's in there...
I'm in to the directory but they've codified the stockpile--numerically.
How much of this shit do they have, White!!
What does that mean?
Allow me to assure you that my government will not be satisfied with a polite note of regret for this shocking example of aggression against our peace-loving people.
That's right, fella.
What did you say, sir?
Well...I suppose penetrate the base by force.
But that would mean some of our own boys will get hurt, Mister President.
That certainly would be a problem, sir.
But -- why...that would be an awful thing to do, sir.
Yes, sir.  Why don't you stop the fighting, sir?
How many planes did we lose?
General Faceman, what was the name of the officer who called me from Burpelson?
Thanks, Binky.  Can you see Bromdingna Island yet?
They must have been fired from Bromdingna - probably one of their new Vampire - 202's. They've got a range well over a hundred miles.
Speed?
Call them every five miles.
Check your code again.  No one at base would pull a stunt like that, Terry.
Skip it and jump, damn you!  This flak's so close, I can smell it.
Lothar, get up here fast, and bring your First- Aid kit!  I'm hit kinda bad, I think.
He's dead.
I bit his jugular vein.  Now will you shut up and get up here???
You're giving them an awful lot of credit for being on the ball.
Sorry, King.
But who would be chosen?
Why is everything about you, Jeff?
Oh, untrue, Jeffster. I think, uh, two weeks ago we attended a concert where I had fucked two girls.
And your mom.
Where are you-hoo?
Stuck, who? What guy? Huh?
So you can do an album cover?
Wait, what happened to the tree?
Sure I am. It's fun.
We're your customers. We're not complaining.
Please.
Uh, you know, just admiring the scenery, you know?
Oh, sure.
Oh, Erica, this is my friend Jeff.
Jeff, Erica. God, it's so amazing to be back home.
I mean, we've been playing big places everywhere, but when we did that sound check at The Orpheum, it suddenly hit me. I'm playing The Orpheum, you know? I mean, the last time I played here was, uh, the prom.
Two-fifty? They go up?
No, wait, no, I thought about New York.
Hey, Ma, look at me! Top of the world, Ma!
No.
Did it ever occur to you that I might have some feelings about you moving to New York?
Us.
And?
No, no, see, that's not what I'm saying. I could go to New York if I wanted to, but what's the point? So I can learn how to order a cappuccino? So I can get mugged by some crackhead? So I can see, see homeless people up close and personal?
Nothing.
Okay, well, then, I'm gonna break new ground.
Mm-hm.
Okay, look. My job is not who I am. I don't need that. Why? What's your goal? Status? Money? Getting your picture on the cover of some glossy magazine?
So, what, why can't you do that here? What's wrong with here? Why is somewhere else better?
Mm-mm.
No, no.
I don't know.
'Bye, Jeff.
What?
What do you mean?
I don't know. Uh, I'm an artist, I guess. You know, there's life and then there's the people watching the life, commenting on it.
What?
Well, I, I didn't say I was special, but it's one thing, you know, and it's another thing to actually communicate it to people. You know what I mean? If a tree falls in a forest and no one hears it, does that make a sound?
Alright, alright, enough with the Boy Scout routine.
Oh, no, man. I can't.
Oh, my god!
Whatever.
Don't do that, man, okay?
Come on, Jeff.
You have three heart attacks and a half dozen strokes and tell me how much you wanna run up and down the stairs.  Shit - I forgot to pick up the cigarettes.
Cleo, I've already thrown up twice today - could you please get to any relevant part of the movie?
If you don't - can you still afford to go to Harvard?
So then this isn't crazy.  It's a sure bet.
Mmm-hmmm...
Uh, "no"... You're not fat.
Oh thank Buddha it's you, Kim-Lo, I'm being held against my will, my civil rights have been violated and it took four days to make this one phone call...
Kim-Lo?
Ooops, that's me -- gotta run!
We're dead!  They showed this prison movie to my youth group on Sunday.
It wasn't like the prison we saw - all these women had to shave their heads because they got lice from the filthy lives they'd lived!  Oh G-d, I'm gonna be someone's bald bitch!
But you're not married.
More proof God's a guy...
Virgin Mary musta snuck that one in.
The greatest.  They call me the Elsa Maxwell of the assistant directors.  Hey, easy on the punch bowl.  Budget only calls for three drinks per extra. Fake the rest.
That was last year.  This year I'm trying to earn a living.
I tell you this is half sold.
It must be my new shampoo.
Twenty-two.
You'd better.  I'm very angry.
That's no excuse.  You read the script, didn't you?
Then you could have picked up the phone yourself instead of leaving it to one of your assistants.
Don't play innocent.  Somebody named Gordon Cole.
And if you hadn't been pretty darned interested in that script, he wouldn't have tried to get me on the phone ten times.
I think that's what it says on my driver's license.
Sure have.  The last one I wrote was about cattle rustlers. Before they were through with it, the whole thing played on a torpedo boat.
What's wrong with It?
I don't need any clothes, and I certainly don't want you buy- ing them for --
"Mad about the boy."
Shut up.  I'm rich.  I'm richer than all this new Hollywood trash. I've got a million dollars.
I own three blocks downtown. I have oil in Bakersfield -- pumping, pumping, pumping. What's it for but to buy us anything we want.
Maybe deMille is shooting.
Norma, grow up.  You're a woman of fifty.  There's nothing tragic about being fifty - not unless you try to be twenty-five.
Goodbye.  Norma.
It was the room of the husband. Or of the husbands, I should say. Madame has been married three times.
Is that So?
Had to get away for his health, I suppose.
Sure we believe you, only now we want you to believe us.  That car better be back here by noon tomorrow, or there's going to be fireworks.
Yes.  Madame.
What is it?
I've been saving it. For the right moment.
It's for your own protection.
What's that?
No.
Of course not, but...there are things we don't understand.
Well...I guess one is all right.
Are you asking me for a "date"?
Aren't you forgetting about Selena?
Hmmm?
I don't want your help.
I've got things to do.
Call me next week. Maybe we can have lunch.
How do you know?
Did anybody notice you?
Lucy! Be serious. We could be executed for  treason!
It was my fault. You aren't old enough to use the wand. I shouldn't have given it to you.
I dunno, but he's gonna get creamed.
It may well be. I know how you won that election Selena. You can't fool me.
You're not going anywhere. Except back to nowheresville. You're too impatient, Selena. Look around you--all these people have served years and years of apprenticeship. Some of their families have been in the Craft for generations. You can't join and take over our whole organization in a few months.
You would! You revealed our existence so you could have all of our power.
Why get rid of her at al1? You've used the Coffer of Shadow too much.  It is beginning to rule your heart.
Yes, I see it. Shining like a jewel.
I knew it!
Why?
First the supplier couldn't find the invoice. Then the order came up short. Then I missed the four o'clock plane from Cleveland and had to rent a car, and then I got a darn flat tire on the highway! Can you beat it? Boy, your boss must've been furious when I didn't show up by the end of the day today, huh?
Clark.
Some people don't think it's healthy.
Clark, I think you worry too much about mayonnaise.
I'm talking about salt.  Oh, go ahead, pour it on, relax. That's what picnics are for.
Well, he's going to get the best home-cooked meal he's had in... in a long time. You tell Superman we think he's wonderful.
Sure.
Yeah.
Kitchen. . . Technician
Nope, but --
Thirty-five.
They said I lost it on the subway, but it ain't the truth! It was a pickpocket took it!
Well, it was one of them little bitty two-inch screen Japanese jobs.
Man, them people was crazy! How they 'spect you to learn all that jive on the first day? "Hold the pickle! Hold the lettuce! Extra onions! Special sauce! No special sauce!" Ain't nobody found no meat inside that glop yet.
I know, I'm the fault.
Don't call me a bum! I ain't no bum!
What about this week's check?
I'm tryin' to.
Just the man I wanted to see!
I did. isn't it neat-o?
What are you talking about, fella?
For what?
We've already got some.
You designed it?
What will it do?
What will it get me?
Tell me more...
Oh Bubba, think of the possibilities.
Well...I guess they did get a little carried away.
Tell me.
In other words, push this red button.
My friend, you are yesterday. Whoever pulled this caper is tomorrow.
We already have a super-tanker.
I could have it all! Holy cats! All the oil! All the tankers! All the pumps! The gosh-darn world will be out to lunch! No heat, no gas--sis, this is some nifty idea!
It's your genius, pal! You built a machine that can find anybody's weak spot, just like you said.
In July???
Uh-uh.  Listen, I'll tell you what. You say I'm wrong. And I say I'm right. So why don't we make a little bet on it?
Let's get you inside . . . .
Well, you should. Because I appreciate you, too, you know.
Sure. Especially if you'd be a really terrific guy and bring me a cheeseburger to go --
It' s fantastic! ----- This place is genius.
I'll be alright.
It's beautiful.
I want my Liberace record back tonight.
Hey, don't worry. You'll be fine, Just . . . well, don't rush it.
Put down Lex Luthor?
Brave young heroes. Be nice to them, my dear. Blow them a kiss.
Actually, I had a crash course from my mother the night before my prom.
Oh . . . Right. . . I'll be back in a flash.
I don't think 'fan mail' fits this letter.  Read it, Clark.
Because I made a vow. Never to interfere in the destiny of your planet.
I'm going to pass this letter on to all the leaders of the world. I promise you. For it is they , and not I, that represent the people of Earth.
Don't be over-dramatic, young lady. What kind of disaster could we help bring about?
He was getting on . . . and then this man with luggage and . . .  oh, it's a long story.
You're just an experiment, freako!
I made you, and I can destroy you.
Still having delusions, Lex Luthor?
And stop interrupting. his is the big scene.  Your finest hour! You rose to the challenge, baby! And you lost. That's the best part!
North. It's north
You're great with the advice, Clark. Maybe you'd better take over the lovelorn column.
Sure, and let the plane crash in the middle of the city.
Look, lady, you saved my life once. I owe you a favor. But I can't understand why you follow a man like that.
Okay.  Take me to your leader.
Fifty degrees below and still falling.
I don't like to talk about it, Lex.
You ever try to run in high heels?  You probably did.
Tea?
What if he doesn't show up? What if he's taking a nap?
What's your name, boy?
Okay, but...why?  No offense.
Sure.
Very much.
Well, I was born on a planet your scientists don't know too much about. It's in the Xeno Galaxy. Or it was. It was called Krypton. That's K-R-Y-P...
It's a Twinkie, boss.
Maybe I should get help.
You're right, you're right, Superman. There were wrinkles to iron out. But, well...  ...there is this new rocket, the XK 101.
I know. I know.  I never promised myself a rose garden.
Other clinics?  Oh sure.  Clinics, half-way houses, treatment centers, detox units...
She didn't.
That's where I'm going.  To see her.
Yes.  Do you find there's something strange about this meat?
Why are you telling me this?
It does concern me.
How?
It's natural.
Well, maybe that's because they know I'm going to follow them.  Behind the bus.
Sure.
Berries.
Hi, Dolores.
No.  What's this lawyer business?
That you didn't die?  Like the other children?
Will you be spending more than a night?
A car wash!  Wow, I've never talked to you when you've been in a car wash.  Make sure you've got the windows closed.
Why are you calling me, Zoe?
Is there shrimp on it?
If you could pick the shrimp off, as well as anything that touches the shrimp...
Well, let's see what we get.
Yes.
About eight-thirty in the morning.
Yes.
No.
I was scared.  And there wasn't time.
No.  Because the bus went off the road.  And crashed.
Yes.  I do now.  Now that I'm telling it.
You and Mom have a lawyer?
My lawyer?  Why do I need a lawyer?
But Charlene...
The next time you want information, Falco, don't scratch for it like a dog - ask for it like a man!
Robard's my client.  I did it for him and his club, not your boys.
You've been very kind about it, Mr. Hunsecker. HUNSECKER Give Susie credit for that.  I took her word that there was nothing to the smear.  Matter of fact, I'll have my say about smears on the show today.  That's why I'd like YOUR personal assurance, too.
I'll by that, son.  Now, you owe ME a favor.  Be good to my kid sister...
No, I'm not.  I'm not!
Sometimes I think ALL men are fools!...
Yeah, I got eyes.  I put things together.
Are you finished?
Not "we", Sidney, you!
Ha!  My right hand hasn't seen my left hand for thirty years!
Calculated risk.  Only we happen to know, J.J., that you like me.  I'm your star pupil -- I reflect back to you your own talent.
I call him the boy with the ice cream face!
I've been up to here.  Listen, honey, tell me something.  You know Susan Hunsecker...?  Has she been in?  I mean lately, in the last coupla days...?
You're sure.  Find out for me.
I beg your pardon!  I turn myself inside out to help you and now I'm a heavy.  Here's your shoe, there's your coat, that's the door!
Take a top coat.
Don't you think it's about time you shut yours?  Who are you to tell a man like Frank D'Angelo to shut up?!
Chickie, I'll have to laugh at that - an attractive girl like you...!
That was two months ago.  Take your hand out of my pocket, thief!
But I don't care about that now. He knew what he was doing today. He was laying down the conditions under which he MIGHT consent to our marriage - if I would bend to every whim of his, like Sidney!  I couldn't do that, Susie...
Those lying motherfuckers!
Max.
Right.
No.
No.  I have to stay functional until my mission is complete.  Then it doesn't matter.
Yes.  Throw it in.
I love you, John.  I always have.
I see.  Let's go back to what you were saying about these terminator machines.  Now you think they don't exist?
Why him?
Then what?
On all what?
I don't know.
I guess it's possible.
Colonel Dymshitz asked specially to see you.
Yeah.
With more what? More what?
David, I don't understand a thing about you. You're a Jew. Are you a Jew?
A human being, oh, good, I'm relieved, I thought you were going to say you were a music lover. This man, this great artist has made anti-Semitic remarks like you wouldn't believe. I got letters.
What is it with you, David? Where are your feelings? Where's your hatred, your disgust? Where's your fucking outrage, David?
Oh yes, Major, I have recordings of all his symphonies. I kept them safe during the bombing. My favourite is the Seventh Symphony.
But... he only wrote nine, Major.
No. Ours was damaged.
The names of the members of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra since 1934 together with their questionnaires.  Major, what am I to tell Dr. Furtwngler?
May I ask a question?
When will my case be heard by the Tribunal?
I need to work. I need to make my living. I live off the generosity of friends...
Then why is it, please, that another conductor who was actually a member of the Party, who used to play the Horst Wessel before his concerts, has already been cleared and is working again while I have to wait and wait and wait?
It was because I learned that the Gestapo was about to arrest me.
I believe it was because of another letter I'd written to Goebbels lamenting the decline of musical standards due to racial policies.
This is absolute nonsense!
Of course there was a conspiracy against me, a campaign - even abroad.
I'll ask the questions, Helmuth.
Major, we're discussing a man of genius, I don't want...
Nope.
Sure.
Jeez, and I never heard of him.
A phased plasma pulse-laser in the forty watt range...
What's it to ya?
That's none of your business.
Freezing.
Let's get cleaned up, Kyle.
You must have had a fun child-
Cover...our footsteps...
I guess so.  You're a doctor?
Shut up.
A bad month.  You did the exact same thing to me last week.
What... is... happening... ?
What's C.R.S.?
If this was my office, I wouldn't keep that closed.
Wha... ?
It might be best if we didn't talk.
How many times have you done this? I'm interested.
Scams, con games.  How many?
Whatever kind of nickel-and-dime shit you did before, this is more than just me.  Your friends raided pension plans, and payrolls... they took just over six-hundred million.  You ruined people's lives.
Where'd you get that gun?
We searched the house.
Just... wait.  Just wait!  Okay... please, I'm not kidding anymore...
So do you.  And to think I was worried...
How long's it been?  Since mom died... four years?  How are you?
Elizabeth?
Too bad, I liked her.  So, you're all alone in the House of Pain?
Nowhere in particular.  Don't you keep track of my whereabouts anymore?
Yeah.
No.
I don't need anything from you.  I was laying on a beach somewhere in Spain, naked, and, it hit me -- Nickie's birthday.  So, here I am, four layovers, twenty-seven hours flying and one donkey ride later. Not necessarily in that order.
No, it doesn't!  Those keys were put there.  I didn't even know...
Listen to yourself.   Why would I do anything like what you're describing?
Stop this.  It's not true...
Stop it!
Yes.
Hey, everyone -- snack time!  Here... here you go...
First they try to kill me, now you?  Put your damn clothes back on.
Was he morose, or...?  I mean...
Sometimes I wonder how much of him there is in me.
I'm just like him.
Did you worry about him?
Is Alan Baer "the Game?"  Is that what this is?
Sam...  Thank you.
I did okay.
It's a question.
Will the two of you shut up!  God damn it!  Maybe the tests were right, Marrow.  She's sensitive, she's vulnerable, but I don't think she's suicidal and I didn't have to test her.  Maybe she wasn't trying to kill herself. Maybe she was really scared. Maybe she really heard voices.
But there's a sad catch to the story.
And they're all locked together in here... and he won't let go of them!
How'd I know it was for you?
Yes.  But I promised I wouldn't let her alone the whole night.
Mrs. Dudley.
Yes.  I've missed it.
I don't know what to think anymore.
Nell, it makes sense.  It all makes sense.  You and I, we were scaring each other, working each other up.
All your life.  That happened while I swam the length of my pool.
We'll find him.
You could use a few of my prime shitkickers up here.
There's already gonna be talk about how people close to you keep falling into canyons.
No, but between the lines, eh? Mysterious circumstances, and that.
What do I do, then, look in the bleedin' Yellow Pages?
Thought perhaps there'd be dispensing machines, you know.  Bung in your coins, come out with a .44 Magnum, fully-loaded.
<u>Valets</u>.  They park cars.  He's having a party.
Hard to miss.
In Jenny?  'Course not.  How could I be. 'Course I wasn't.
Footloose and fancy free.
You think Terry gave me access to her things?  Probably sold her clothes.
Up the coast.
I don't know -- few hours, I guess.
I could use a vacation.  Of course, I keep forgetting, for you this <u>is</u> a vacation.
What's in Big Sur?
How do you know?
Nine years?  Is that legal?
But you stuck it out, anyway, all that time.
Sounds like you need a rest.
I have a message for him.  About Jennifer Wilson.
Have we met?  There's something I can't quite --
Ah.
I don't.
I suppose that's good, unless things were fine the way they were.
I'm so sorry... I was sorry to hear.
But I do appreciate it, Mr Crane...
Sorry, friend, I, uh, you got me at a disadvantage.
Jesus! The barber! I'll be a sonofagun. Why didn't you say so? 'Course--the barber.
Look, uh... Creighton...
I'm at Nirdlinger's. Let yourself in.
Who?
How's that?
Nah, don't say anything. I'm alright.
...a puny player on the great world's stage...
...who among us is in a position to say...
Oh, no. That was written by Mr Ludwig van Beethoven.
Yeah.
Frank, uh, you know I'll try to contribute, but, uh--Freddy Riedenschneider--
That's very generous.
Hello.
It better be good.
No.
Do they have to wear uniforms?
I don't want to scare people.
Where the hell are you?
It's a little late, you son of a bitch.  There's a friggin' monster loose in here!  Get the FBI, the fire department.  Find metal cutters, cut through.  And bring a cannon.  The damn thing is huge.
If you don't mind a suggestion, you might try a saliva test.
Pardon my French, but bull shit.
I'd say we're in its home.
I'm not sure.  As you know, the Kothoga lived outside civilization on the tepui for thousands of years. Species flourished in isolation when man and pollution rendered them extinct.  This could be one of the last remaining samples of an unknown plant.
You're right.
No, Dr. Frock.  You can't.
He's right.
They were green eyes and they were slit like a lizard's.
You're color blind.
Keep the animal quiet.
Try Weinstein's tropic hormone.
I don't know.
You were behind me?  Running after me?
The planetarium!
What?
All prop cars accounted for?
Certainly a nomination.
As with our own lives, the only people he can't cast are his family.  Otherwise he has final approval, able to elevate an extra into a lead role as was the case with his only real friend, Marlon, or alternatively relegate a star to a bit player.
They removed all physical trace of her but they couldn't erase the memory.
Shhh!
So when are you leaving?
Nursery?
It's a surprise.
I still want to look over a couple of things.
I bet you did.
I've got something to tell you.  You'd better sit down.
You're not supposed to talk about it? Who told you that?
Yes.
That the bombing in Dallas may have been to destroy the bodies of those firemen, so their deaths and the reason for them wouldn't have to be explained --
Yes. I know.
Strughold. He's just gotten on a plane in Tunis.
Standing around holding your yank while bombs are exploding.
How?
You said the firemen and the boy were found in the temporary offices of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Why?
It was a deadly virus spread by field mice in the Southwest U.S. several years ago.
Are you saying it wasn't such a small outbreak?
How's that?
What do you say we call in a bomb threat for Houston. I think it's free beer night at the Astrodome.
-- Mulder! Get in the car!
I can't really talk right now.
Evidence of a massive infection.
I don't know.
Mulder --
I've got a hearing tomorrow --
Mulder -- I can't -- I'm already way past the point of common sense here --
I've got to be in Washington D.C. in eleven hours for a hearing -- the outcome of which might possibly affect one of the biggest decisions of my life. And here I am standing out in the middle of nowhere Texas, chasing phantom tanker trucks.
-- of what exactly?!
They haul gas in tanker trucks, they haul oil in tanker trucks -- they don't haul viruses in tanker trucks.
What do you mean by haul?  What are you not telling me here?
Mulder --
I don't believe this. I don't fucking believe this.  Y'know, I've been here... I've been here one too many times with you, Mulder.
Pounding down some dirt road in the middle of the night. Chasing some elusive truth on a dim hope, only to find myself standing right where I am right now: at another dead end --
You saved me, Scully.  As different and frustrating as it's been sometimes, your goddamn strict rationalism and science have saved me a thousand times; have kept me honest and made me whole. I owe you so much, Scully, and you owe me nothing.  I don't want to do this without you. I don't know if I can. If I quit now, they win.
Thank you.
A weak vaccine against the virus Agent Scully has been infected with. It must be administered with ninety six hours.
No. Though I have no way to prove otherwise. The virus is extraterrestrial. We know very little about it, except that it is the original inhabitant of this planet.
A simple, unstoppable lifeform. What is a virus but a colonizing force that cannot be defeated? Living in a cave, underground, until it mutates. And attacks.
No! For God sake you've got it all backwards.
In hope of what? Learning that it's true?! That we are nothing more than digestives for the creation of a new race of alien lifeforms?!
And if it doesn't? By cooperating now we're but beggars to our demise! Our ignorance was in cooperating with the Colonists at all.
I've heard this argument before.  It's not happening.
If we reverse the feed and bring Edward into your mind, it could be devastating for him.  Imagine the shock of suddenly existing in a whole other world.
Yes, but, you're a willing participant. Picture Edward in a strange place, lost, frightened...
And he might blame you for terrifying him.  That one moment could erase all you've accomplished.  And if that happened, the trust he has in you is gone.
What's wrong?
Just like we all have fantasies, right? Things only we know, that we don't share.
Carl, do you know?  Like on a map...
He's beautiful...
I think that's the whole point.
Prevacid.  For my stomach.
No.
No.
I am.  I'm a pretty boring guy.
Damn, man, I give up.  Your partner tells you his wife's gonna have a baby, and all you care about is a coroner's report!
Ja, ja, ja.
Dr. Winkel told me that.
The doctor Harry used to go to. He was passing just after it happened.
Yes.
Sssh. Don't. Don't, please.
Tell me more.
He told you, didn't he?
He's safe in the Russian zone.
I saw him today.
They're Harry's.
You won't learn anything from them. They are only love letters. There are not many of them.
There's nothing in them.
Where's Harry?
I'm sorry - I don't seem able to understand anything you say. He's alive now this minute - he's doing something.
I don't know.
Yes, of course.
What are you trying to say?
As soon as I get to the bottom of this, I'll get the next plane.
Do you mind if I use that line in my next Western? You can't chuck me out, my papers are in order.
Thank you. Excuse me.
Well, there's not much time.
I'll look it up for you.
Good evening Mr. Crabbin.
It's good to see you, Holly.
Do you know, I don't ever feel comfortable on these sort of things...Victims?
What's the good of another post mortem? Suppose you dig up something - well - discreditable to Harry?
I understand...
You saw it?
Why didn't they bring him in the house?
Two double whiskeys. Was wunschen sie?
Why no, Mr. Martins.
Traveler.
I don't think so.
I wouldn't know anything about that, sir.
What!
Hi there. Here, take a look.
We have free will and intelligence -- which God allegedly gave us....
Who the fuck are you?
Why the fuck not?
You weren't complaining about my play last time.
Why not?
That's stupid.
Is it like Eichmann? Are we goofing?
Shit...  Did you talk to your mother today?
Nothing.  Why are you doing this?  I thought God didn't exist.
And be crushed.
He's Jewish? Manzetti?
No... Yeah, fine, go ahead... So what's this about? Is this about me?
What about Curtis Zampf?
I agree.
In the movement -- the racialist movement -- we believe there's a hierarchy of the races. Not just in IQ, but in the civilization, the art, the forms of government, the civilizations that each race produces... Why are you writing this down if you're recording it?
What should I be, a white inferior- ist? A multicultural Zulu egalitarian? Let me ask, where are your people from?
German. Mine, too. So who do you think's given more to the world, the Germans -- Beethoven, Goethe, Nietzsche -- or the entire continent of Africa? Ibos, Bantus, Mandingos...
I can't help what I think.
Lina... It's happening. Tonight.
Beth Shalom. Like you wanted.
Lina, you said if I was going to plant a bomb, I should --
You could do it.
You look right through him. He's there, but there's something on the other side of him that you want. It's all you want. And whatever's in the way doesn't matter.... Then it's easy.
You said they didn't have night guards.
Who even knew?
Why? Why would she?
So what do we do with the device?
Four. But no one this important.
Dennis Leary.
No.
Danny, please, we don't want to know.
Yes...  Could you please give this to Enzo.
It's the Free Diving World Championship.  I am by the way world champion!
Enzo, stop bitching, will you?
The company asked me to extract everything I could from the wreck; so the divers were trying to get at the engine... and then the boat turned over... in the current... and... look, I fucked up!  Can you help?
He's training.
Yes, of course.  Lots of questions.
... For the mermaids.
No problem, I enjoy talking in my sleep.
I can't.
I guess... But you know... I'm American and I've mostly been taught to be competitive... There's always pleasure of being the best?
I did?
I didn't dive.
I don't know... it didn't feel right.  I'm going to bed.  I'm tired.
Yes Sir, and it has been so for 127 years.
No Sir, the hotel is full because of the Diving championship.
... Sally?
Mayol... Jacques Mayol.
What's your first move?
What do you want me to do?
Sure. Why not.
I'm sorry Esther, I just don't think we can see each other romantically anymore.
Well I'm just glad you're safe Bubba Shaina, and eating by your mother for Shabos.
Oh. It means that Santa's gonna fuck Hanukkah's shit up.
Well that's good news for us. It means the system is outdated. This should be easy. C'mon.
While I was in Taiwan negotiating the solution to our labor problems, I came across a factory that illegally manufactures the most addictive, Jewish pride weakening substance on the planet. I bought the entire plant.
It's Friday.
It don't look like a leopard to me.
Here have a cigarette. He was only kidding.
Go on -
Hey  I'm over here.
About Charlie's leopard?
I couldn't rest - I couldn't sleep. All I could see was Teresa Delgado's body -- broken --mangled. I saw it day and night.  It was waiting everywhere I turned.
I didn't want to kill, but I had to. I heard her in the cemetery - talking to the man in the auto --
Go on foot.
Kiki -- he won't hurt you. There's nothing to be afraid of.
Listen, Kicks, you'll never guess what I've cooked up this tine...
I thought -- is Kiki just going to walk on that floor tonight walk out cold before a bunch of gawks who think a Spanish twirler is the greatest thing in life. No. Not my favorite client. She's going to make an entrance this town will never forget!
No. I thought that might be just a little corny. I want you to lead him in on a leash.
Look, Kicks, have I ever done anything to hurt you?
And I never will- you know what's between us  we're a thing But this is serious competition.
Kiki - he won't hurt you. There's nothing to be afraid of.
Listen, Kicks, you'll never guess what I've cooked up this time.
I thought - is Kiki just going to walk on that floor tonight walk out cold before a bunch of gawks who think a Spanish twirler is the greatest thing in life. No. Not my favorite client. She's going to make an entrance  this town will never forget.
No. I thought that might be just a little corny.  I want you to lead him in on a leash.
Look, Kicks, how long have we known each other?
Almost three years, isn't it? And have I ever done anything to hurt you?
And I never will -- you know what's between us - we're a thing -- But this is serious -- big competition.
I thought you might strut this kitten in right in the middle of her act.
Do they close up every year for this Processionist business?
I'm no detective. I don't even know how to begin. All I know is I want to do something about all this.
I work here, sir. Im here most of the time.
You will have to ask Mr De Moraes that, sir.  Would you like a drink while you wait?
I was hired by your parents, Mrs De Moraes.
Uh... Wait a moment, Mrs De Moraes...
...You-you spoke to him?
Yes. Im trying to reach a friend but I cant get through. The number is 01766 770 471.
The Mondrian, room 504. I was checked out in my absence.
Yeah.
Burn the passport and keep the money. Think of it as a donation to the cause...
Huh! And they say charitys only rewarded in Heaven... Hallelujah...  Christ...
Jee... Fuck... Youre fucking mad!
La what?
Should I?
That are called Rommel or something, I guess not that many. 
Its Friday night, Jane. What happened to your latest boyfriend?
Well, I hope youre not too heartbroken and...
Recommended?
Didnt you say I came recommended?  Thats what I thought. May I know by whom?
Okay. Recommended...
Look Mrs Spitz... I dont know to whom Im indebted for the recommendation but... Im not in the business of making oaths of allegiance or giving myself character references. What I do is listen to what the people who care to call me have to say and judge whether or not I can be of help. I hope you can appreciate that, Mrs Spitz.
Does it matter?
Who are you? Who are you working for, huh?
Youre making a mistake, tough guy. Whoever he is, your guys not one of Friedmans...
I told you... The rabble, its me...  Huh... Its sad.
Dying without ever reaching the top...
How are you, Rhian?
Hows the boy doing?
Good. You neednt worry about the Austrian anymore. Hes dead. Ill be in touch.
Alors quoi?
A lachat, trois ou quatre mille. En location, cinq cent. Mais a pourrait faire plus. Je ne sais pas. Cest pas vraiment mon truc.  I dont know any Austrian, Xavier.
Then why dont you reach him?
Cost what?
Whats that? A word?
I dont know. Could be the sound of jewellery hitting a parquet floor, huh?
Sure. But speak English, will ya, ha ha...
Do you think I could have some water?
Jeanne, you've been badly wounded...
You listen to your voices, I listen to my heart.
Good.
Sound the retreat...
I made no such promise.  Sound the retreat for the night!
I'm fed up with taking her orders. She swore she'd defeat the English before nightfall, instead of which she goes and plays the fool and gets herself nearly killed!  Look at the mess we're in!  That's her mess, not mine...!  We're worse off then if she'd never come at all!  ... now do as I say and Sound the Retreat!
What are you doing?  This is an ecclesiastical court -- you have no right to do this!
I was talking to the priest, and do you know what he said to me?
These questions have nothing to do with your trial.
Not long ago...
Last night.
I -- I can't Jeanne... I can't hear your confession... I'm sorry...
Orleans has held out for six months. I don't suppose a few days will make much difference.  Take some rest.
If there was, I didn't see it...
Go and ask him yourself.
Can we -- uh -- discuss this later?
Me too...
Jeanne, look behind you.
God knows, but it was a bad idea!
Yes... a half-steed... white.
My king.
Five steeds and a few hackneys...
No.
Yes, I was given a few, but I never had time to wear them...
And you look pretty wealthy for a servant of God, wouldn't you say?
They're going to come and visit you in here?
I want to see that.  Do you mind if I stay... on the side?  I won't bother you.
Why not?
Do you think you are ready?
Perhaps... but wherever he comes from, I think you should listen to him, because it sounds like he's giving you very good advice.
You know something? Meeting you like that was absolutely wonderful.
Yes!  It was...it was unforgettable.
What are you doing?
Oh my God, it's terrible, you've got to do something, oh my God!
They're hunting people on the streets. They've picked up Henryk.
It certainly was.
Yes, that's why I brought it.
I was listening, Kitten.
No, I don't think so?
Sorry, I don't remember.
Watch your feet!
That is good, yes.
No, I love her, we will be a family. I have her piano. I will mend it, she will get better.
I don't want to learn.
No.
No, no payment. I have given it back. I don't want it.
It was more to your wife that I gave it.
She says, throw it overboard. She doesn't want it. She says it's spoiled
Hah, you're very cunning Ada, but I've seen through you, I'm not going to lose the land this way. Wait here!
Don't worry, we got the wallet. What happened?  He get ya with the knife?
What?
What are you talkin' about?  We just took off the biggest score we've ever had.  We can do anything we want now.
Hey look.  You think I'm gonna run out on ya or somethin'?  Just cause we hit it big.  Luther, I owe you everything.  If you hadn't taught me con, I wouldn't know nothin'.
But you played the Big Con.  You said it was nothin'.  A game for flakes and mama's boys.
I did.  That stuff I gave him was counterfeit.  They'll pinch him the first place he tries to spend it.
Does J.J. know how to use this thing?
If we ever get to it.
Just a little nervous, that's all.
He wants to put a half million on Syphon.
Raise 5,000.
But I got a train to make.
But what about all these other people?
No.  They're just the only ones we know of.
I need somebody respectable...but not completely legit.  What I'm gonna do isn't very legal.
All you gotta do is place a bet for me at Shaw's place.  I'll supply all the money and the information.
He's right, Les.
On the nose!  I said place.  Place it on Syphon.  That horse is going to run second.
Look -- those are the first metals that came through. 
Another young man.
I didn't say I would.  But we've got to have money.
Shush!
Yes.
was fascinated with you....  a real live detective....  You used to tell me the most wonderful stories.  Were they true?
He's been dead for three months.
Must have been in the war.  That might account for the cane and his limp.
No.
I'll have to try to remember.
Fifty will still get you a hundred.
I see.
Why yes.
No.
I don't think so.  Of course I was terribly upset...  I hardly knew what I was doing.
What's the idea of telling me you just knew the Wolfe girl by sight?
He's not anybody.  Just a fellow I used to know.
This is the first time I've seen him in years.  I didn't want him to think I was high-hatting him.
Don't worry.  You won't see him again.  What happened? Did you change your mind about going?
What bonds?
Oh yes.  Why, you told me to sell them a long time ago.
Don't you remember....
Do you realize that you're accusing me of ....
What if I did take them? I'm sick and tired of seeing you hand out thousands of dollars to that family of yours....
supporting that gang of loafers! There's not one of them that cares a damn for you.  A wife who threw you out the first time your foot slipped.  They wouldn't raise a hand to help you.  And I've given my whole life for you.  If you kicked off tomorrow, where'd I be? Out in the gutter!  Sure I took those bonds.  Who has a better right -- ?
What'll I do if something comes up?
Is Julia going with you?
What about it, Tanner.  Isn't that the truth?
So I did.  I saw him lying buried in his shop.
If you like 'em like that.
Only you, darling...  lanky brunettes with wicked jaws.
I was hoping I wouldn't have to tell you.  Dorothy is really my daughter.  You see, it was Spring in Venice, and I was so young.  I didn't know what I was doing.  We were all like that on my father's side.
Much better, thanks.
Six Martinis.
Yes.
That's jolly.
Can't you get to sleep?
Maybe a drink would help you.
Maybe it would if I took it.
He's got more sense than you have. Thank Heaven you're not on this case.
Well, didn't you?
Catch me letting you go alone!
Let's see... where was I?  Oh, yes.  He went to find the man. That man was desperate!  He knew that he was caught dead to rights -- and with prison staring him in the face, he took the only way out. He killed Wynant.  It's terrible to tell you this way but your father's dead, Dorothy.
Home!
I'm fired.
You did.
Damn, this is sweet.  We are going to be home in no time.
Not much chance of that.  Jaeger's an idiot.
He's an idiot, and he's not nearly as hard as he thinks.
Let me see the map.
What about the gold?
Maybe we should split it up now.
What if we get separated?  Way I see it if something happens I want to be carrying my share.
You said he was a deserter.
You don't know that.
Tell me something, Wes.  Are you crazy, greedy, or just stupid?  Jaeger says you're crazy.
There might be something in there.
There might be.
We go, we get rich, we go home.  It's that easy.
I steady it out, they blow us out of the sand!
Mine.  Land mine!
Wes is right.  If there were any more mines we would have found them.  Hell, that one you stepped on was probably old anyway; left over from the war with Iran.
If we step on a mine we'll know it was. Let me see the maps.
Something like that.
I hope it means something, otherwise...
I wouldn't know.  I never imagined this. Not in my whole life did I ever imagine this.
We need something:  A flare, a signal mirror.
Okay.  Then we go this way.
I don't have a weapon.
We go this way.
I could use some recon photos too.
Yeah, you're funny.
For real?  A treasure?
It's right here.  This region; an-Nagaf. I got recon photos.  There're no troops there, no fighting--
It's about a hundred miles from where we are now.  How long do you think it would take us to--
It's real.  I'm telling you, it's real.
Yeah, well, we're not.
I know you're a pussy.  I know that.
He lived through that?
What happened?
Don't be so sure.
I don't know.
What?
No, look!  Three degrees from the central azimuth.
When?.....How?
But you can't...you.
Soon he'll be a plastic cube.
You are a true believer.  Blessings of the state, blessings of the masses.  Thou art a subject of the divine.  Created in the image of man, by the masses, for the masses. Let us be thankful we have an occupation to fill.  Work hard; increase production; prevent accidents, and be happy.
What do you mean?
Then let's go see what they missed.
Take a tip from the Bomb Boys, always assess, if only for a second.
Your partner?
Close your eyes, feel your fingertips. Tell me everything you feel.
Exactly my thinking. Except, none of the targets can actually be linked to government, political or special interest concerns. They seem to be just unrelated industrial companies. Some insured, some not. 
A bowling alley.
We're moving' on. I have to pick up the supplies. Just two little boxes.
Nothing so far.
Lab's backed up, we're still waiting for it.
That'd be some explosive pussy he's got his hands on.
Nah, let's just take a look-see.
You mean you just--? ... You keep a record of... matches?
Report on the case so far.
Yes, sir.
Tell M'sieu Giron I can't see him now. Impossible!  And, Jacques. Dismiss the car! Madame is not going. 
About tonsils.
So I said to myself, "All right, if he wants to look at them, let him look at them. No harm in that." And then he said, "Say ah." And then I said, "Ah." And that's all I remember ... And when I woke up, I still had my tonsils, but my pocketbook was gone.
But please, Baron. We're not supposed to breathe a word of it. You won't tell anybody I told you?
Yes, Baron. Thank you. 
You know, when I first saw you, I thought you were an American.
Someone from another world--so entirely different. One gets so tired of one's own class--princes and counts and dukes and kings--ah! And everybody talking shop--always trying to sell jewelry ... And then I heard your name and found you were just one of us.
No--proud. Very proud!
Ah!
Certainly!
Beautiful. And what of it?  Let me tell you something: so far as I'm concerned, her whole sex appeal is in that safe!
Oh, no, darling. There's <u>more</u> sex appeal coming on the first of the month.  It's only ten days ...  Eight hundred and fifty thousand francs.
In other words, madame, it embarrasses you to offer me the twenty thousand francs reward.
Don't be embarrassed, madame. I'll take it. I need the money. I wish I were in a position to ignore the whole matter. But you know, madame, the stock market, bank crash ... To make a long story short--a member of the nouveaux poor.
You would?
Like that?
I know all your tricks.
So you think you can get me?
You're conceited--
<u>Now</u>, <u>let</u> <u>me</u> <u>tell</u> <u>you</u>--
Yes, Madame Colet?
Yes--uh--
What is it, madame?
Ever had a romance with a crook?
Let me give you a little advice. When you embrace him, be sure to put on your gloves. It would be too bad if your fingerprints were found ...
I don't want your money!
I'm sorry that I didn't build you a stronger ship, young Rose.
That's the shape my hand's gonna be when I hold that thing. You understand? I'm not leaving here without it.
So this is the ship they say is unsinkable.
The Heart of the Ocean. Cal, it's... it's overwhelming.
Can I bum a cigarette?
We gotta get up there or we're gonna be gargling saltwater. Where's Tommy?
No! Stay where you are. I mean it. I'll let go.
What do you mean no I won't? Don't presume to tell me what I will and will not do. You don't know me.
Yes, exactly!
If only it were that simple.
Oh, Jack... please don't judge me until you've seen my world.
Time for my coach to turn back into a pumpkin.
He does landscapes.
I know, I know.
Yes, like a mill pond. Not a breath of wind.
Mmmmm. Well, I'm off. Maintain speed and heading, Mr. Lightoller.
And wake me, of course, if anything becomes in the slightest degree doubtful.
Well, that's the general idea, my dear.
Any woman's crazy to feel about a man the way I do about you.
Sooner--if you like.  See you again, I hope.
Well, it'll have to be poker--but I'm so unlucky in that game.
That depends on how mother's feeling. You'll excuse me, gentlemen?
You're not very ambitious, are you?
You work too fast for me, young man.
Never eat before the show.
For once I'm dead on the level--  --crazy about you!
But--
Sally--!
You mean that?
You said it! How about a little action?
Don't you know better than to talk to me with people around?
I thought you were a smart guy.
We didn't have enough dough for two tickets, did we?
No bank roll there, boy.  Lucky I could get you signed on--they picked up that Pittsburgh jeweler--made him talk. The heat's on, Shortie--and those Atlantic breezes are going to be mighty welcome.
It'll never hurt you---Got any money?
No, you're not. Give me that dollar seventy.
Pleasure first if it don't interfere with business.
Now you're talkin'!
Listen, Runt--Quick! Where's the ice?
Where did you hide it?
Get it!
No, thanks--I never gambled in my life.
You keep out of this--  You admit you thought of killing him--how were you going to do it?
What'll I say?
I thought I put you to bed.
Well, did you find me?
This is a fine time to be asking that. You're on your way to France.
Yes, a bracelet's been lost, but I'm still on my vacation.
Well, I've seen him here and there. What's on your mind?
Well, I'll tell you--we picked him up about a year ago-- but could never pin anything on him.
Yeah--
I just wrote a poem about the Atlantic Ocean--
Somebody's got to do it--
Oh, you dear Atlantic Ocean--how you spread across the sea--From New York to dear old Europe--just for boats to ride on thee--
But I'm not finished yet----And your waves are so colossal--rocking boats both to and fro--Oh-h, Atlantic, how I love you ----how I love you--
I'm getting seasick--
Mr. Denby--What do you think I ought to do with that part?
Looks lonesome--Bring him over here.
Not a chance--I'm through. 
What's the matter?
Why Ed, what an ugly thing to Say!  Does this mean you're not my Friend anymore?  You know, Ed, if I thought you weren't my friend I Don't think I could bear it.
Well I'm not so go home.
Make you a deal.  My brother took Over the Marshal's office in Tombstone.  Got it in his head He's gonna make the place safe For widows and orphans.  You and Your boys stay out of his way, I'll make sure he stays out of yours.
They were all gonna jump me back There.  What ever happened to one Against one?
And how come you call yourselves Cowboys?  Cowhands ride for the brand.
This brand.
My fight's not with you, Holliday.
I was kidding about that.
Didn't you always say gambling's An honest trade?
Depends how you look at it.  I Mean it's not like anybody's Holding a gun to their heads.
Felt his liver go on that last One.  Get him to a doctor or he'll Be dead in a couple hours.
Not half as bad as I feel.
Wyatt Earp is my friend.
I don't.
I know.  Me neither.
Easy now... That mare's in season.
They know.  It's the scent.  We Better split 'em up.
Wait!
I know what I'm doing.  Where have You been?
I don't know.  I'm all right.
Sure I'm sure.  What is this?
Drop his horse.
Lotta law around here.  Just met the Sheriff.
You're on.
But she doted on the frowner
Just stay calm, use your head. It'll be all right.  Just the Same, though...  Guess you better swear me in.
- Thank you, M. But this is more than your man can handle.  Are we in agreement?
Sir Elliot.
Good-bye, Mister Bond.
- We all want what we can't have?
Nothing.
Q's retirement party. I'd just put the knife into the cake, and -
Not if you kill us first - unless that's how you plan to leave Muffy.
Happily.
Three. You? Married?
I didn't think so.
- The family jewels?
Up.
Yes, M.
Actually, you're just in time.  Admiral Roebuck: You know Commander Bond, don't you?
Good-day, Miss Winch. I advise you to get some steam up - before you run aground.
My timing always was lousy.
Yes. Shall we kill them?
Will the cruise set it off?
You dumb ass, it's Babe Brother.
Babe Brother.
This would be a bad time for me to leave.
Just stay in bed and rest.
You stay inside. I will see to them.
That's awful generous of you. I always ask to keep from wearing out welcome.
You remember that boy who lost his mind, Joe? You could hear him pitching horseshoes at night in the dark. He wouldn't miss a one. Make him mad and call yourself running in the house to be safe. He would pick up a brick and say "go on in there brick and hit somebody" and it would find its mark.
All those places that us coloreds lived, that we used to call Bottoms, have all been changed to Drives and Heights. Everything is in what you call it, not in what it is.
You must have done something to her.
Hattie is a different person now.
I'm glad you brought that up as to who you are. I have to know who is in my house.
Only if you are a good man, a friend. Are you a friend?
Now I was trying to be nice, to make conversation, since we go back some.
"Out of weariness, I spoke to my own heart; to leave it all and to die. And I gave my heart to know madness and folly."
Rush your mouth, girl. No, he didn't. He cannot be that big of a damn fool.
He's just raffish. Harry put him up to it. Before evening sun sets, I would have his belongings back on Route 55, that old fox.
Everybody who have been associated with Harry end up with pennies over their eyes.
If it was left up to me, I would poison him.
Oh, yeah!
But what if we leave them behind?
Mm-hmmmmm.
Oh, yeah, tough guy?!
Uh-huh.  And when we get there, we'll be able to find a way to transport you...home.
Shield your eyes!
I can't help.  I can't help anyone.
Andy's house.  Sid's house.  What's the difference.
No, Woody, for the first time I am thinking clearly.  You were right all along.  I'm not a Space Ranger.  I'm just a toy.  A stupid little insignificant toy.
Yeah, right.
But why would Andy want me?
Not today!
I can't see a thing!
She's lying!  Whatever she says it's not true!
A lunchbox...?!
Toss 'im overboard!
I thought he was at summer camp!
I can't quite make out -- 
No, Slink --
Not now, Slink.  I've got some bad news.
Sh-h-h-h-h!!
There's no mirror.
Home is where the heart is.
He'll be looking for another apprentice.
Can you move over a wee bit?
You're late for breakfast.
He has debts.  He has gambling debts. He owes a lot of money.
Nine thousand dollars.
What about legitimate businesses? We own a construction concern, real estate --
Don't you have some good news?  Isn't there something positive you could say.
Drugs begin pouring out of America into every other country in the world. Canada is completely overwhelmed.
She'll be at a pawn shop in an hour.
What about legalizing everything? Has anybody talked about that?
We live our lives by these unspoken rules that are handed to us.
I love my job.  I love it.  The next time I'm having a bad day you gotta remind me of right now and I'll get over it.
What are you?  A mouse?  Get out of the car and do it.  This is your chance.
No, this is not possible.  And I thank you for coming down here, though I suspect it's been a pointless journey.
I hear these stories.  Your husband in jail.  His business in chaos. Various people fighting over the scraps.
That is not true, Mrs. Ayala.  Your route is compromised.  Perhaps it is time for me to deal with other distributors in California.
You don't?  Listen to this woman in a man's world, a very violent world.
But not in whose interest it is to help you out of debt.
The police won't find your car.
An informant.
It was an anonymous tip.
I have money --
I'll pay you a thousand dollars.  I have it in my wallet.
Just tell me where she is.
Agents who died in the field.
You've stabbed me, man.
For four fucking grand?  One palm tree, a couple of rocks, and a sewage outflow.
It's Iggy Pop.
Iggy Pop is not dead. He toured last year. Tommy went to see him.
The pleasure was mine. Best interview I've ever been to. Thanks.
But you're looking better, it has to be said. Healthier. Radiant even.
And I wondered if you'd care to go to the park tomorrow.
Tomorrow afternoon. Usual set-up.
Roald Dahl.
There's a mate of swanney's. Mikey Forrester -- you know the guy. He's come into some gear. A lot of gear.
About four kilos. So he tells me. Got drunk in a pub down by the docks last week, where he met two Russian sailors. They're fucking carrying the stuff. For sale there and then, like. So he wakes up the next morning, realizes what he's done and get very fucking nervous. Wants rid of this. {---------- He's looking for Swanney to punt it, but Swanney's nowhere to be seen since he lost his leg. ---------- }
So he met me and I offered to take it off his hands at a very reasonable price, with the intention of punting it on myself to a guy I know in London.
No joy yet.
Six weeks.
It's a nightmare. She told me she didn't want our relationship to start on a physical basis as that is how it would be principally defined from then on in.
She read it in Cosmopolitan.
I've got balls like watermelons, I'm telling you.
Rescued at last.
I don't have a clue.
I think you gave me too much time, Captain.
Aye, Captain  How many times do I have to tell you? The right tool for the right job...
Go, Sulu.
That song did not come up in my research, Captain.
Fascinating.
Why didn't you tell me this before?
He's sorry, See, he's sorry. Everything... that makes everything all right. He's sorry, everything's...
The emergency channel, open.
In order to lower and raise the shields as quickly as possible, we're going to forego the tractor beam and fly her in manually.

Of course. Of course. Then I'll take the ship without your help.
Boy, if we were inside, I know how to forge us a Group 6 access...
Uh, no ... I mean, not that often -
Yes, okay, exactement!
I... have come to communicate with my User.
I'm sorry, Tron... he's... he didn't make it.
It's too far!
Recognizers!
Not much chance of that now. The MCP can just slip it into another system as soon as it locates it...
Now, sir... We did take care of that User you sent us --
We'll get them, sir... These things take time.
Then I owe you some thanks...
Where are you off to young lady?
Yes.
Sorry, sir.  Uh... here's what we got.
Don't be ridiculous.  She's only -- how old is she?
Right.  She's only fourteen.
Uh huh.  Want me to lose them?
You want me to just hang-- ?
I'll just hang then, shall I?
Wait!  Calm down, Mrs. Tasker. There is only one more question.
Sorry.
Those wimps.  It's because I use    * my diplomatic contacts to export cultural treasures from countries which tell them to take a hike.  I told you to move those crates an hour ago.  Come on guys, let's get going.
Yeah.  You should have seen it. We were the hit of the show with the new model ordering system, the one for the 680... how you can write up an order and the second the customer's name goes into the computer, it starts checking their credit, and if they've ordered anything in the past, and if they get a discount...
They must've just missed me.
Yeah.  It was a rush thing.  They needed some documents down at the court house.  I barely made it.
No.
Don't call me honey!  You don't ever get to call me honey again. You understand?!  You pig!
Absolutely.
Kettleman, Barnes and McGrath. I'm a legal secretary.
He said he was an American agent.
I kept looking back, like you taught me.  I didn't see anyone.
I understand.
Helen.
I just glances inside.
Knock wood.
The letter he sent.
How 'bout me what?
There's nothing to tell.
What do you want to know?
At the movies?
What would make you think that?
You're not stupid. Just wrong.
I just gotta get somethin'.
That rhymes.
I was dying. I thought for sure everyone could see it on my face.
Can you develop an ulcer in two minutes? Being cool is hard on your body.
That was cool, wasn't it? You know, I don't even know where that came from. I just opened my mouth and it came out. After I said it I thought, that's a cool line, I gotta remember that.
Now tell him goodbye.
I'm just makin' sure we got everything.  You got yours?
How 'bout me what?
What are we gonna see?
Who's Sonny Chiba?
You wanna take me to a kung fu movie?
Yeah?
Don't worry, I'll desire. Boris, could I have some more coffee.
What?
Do you still have friends on the force?
Could you find out if they know anythin'? I don't know they know shit about us. But I don't wanna think, I wanna know. You could find out for sure what's goin' on.  Daddy?
You were a cop.
I'm your son.
Look, goddamnit, I never asked you for a goddamn thing! I've tried to make your parental obligation as easy as possible. After Mom divorced you, did I ask you for anything? When I wouldn't see ya for six months to a year at a time, did you ever get your shit about it? No, it was always "OK", "No problem", "You're a busy guy, I understand". The whole time you were a drunk, did I ever point my finger at you and talk shit? No! Everybody else did. I never did. You see, I know that you're just a bad parent. You're not really very good at it. But I know you love me. I'm basically a pretty resourceful guy. If I didn't really need it I wouldn't ask. And if you say no, don't worry about it. I'm gone. No problems.
Where'd you come from?
Well, don't just sit there, shoot him.
This rabbit'll do anything not to do time, including wearing a wire.
Naw, man, it ain't white boy day.
Naw, he ain't home right now.
Yeah, I live here.
Exactly room-mates.
Naw, they ain't stayin' here. But, I know who you're talkin' about. They're stayin' at the Hollywood Holiday Inn.
No, I ain't been there. But I heard him say. Hollywood Holiday Inn. Kinda easy to remember.
No, sir!  I just want to do my part. To get us back on top...in charge of the planet.  And I have the experience, I know who the people are...
What's she doing?
1989.  Six years for you.  There's the sign!  Right here!
Who's keeping an eye on you?
You have to give yourself up, you know.
A Carpet Cleaning Company?
You... you left them a message?
I need to make a telephone call.
I get it!  This is your old plan, right?
Remember?  We were in the dayroom, watching TV, and you were all upset about the...desecration of the planet. And you said to me, "Wouldn't it be great if there was a germ or a virus that could wipe out mankind and leave the plants and animals just as they are?"  You do remember that, don't you?
And that's when I told you my father was this famous virologist and you said, "Hey, he could make a germ and we could steal it!"
Then are you trying to tell me that a fully sedated, fully restrained patient somehow slipped out that vent, replaced the grill behind him and that he's wriggling through the ventilation system right now?
You want something, old man?
You want something?
You can't do that yourself?
I'm sorry, I didn't--
I don't know.  I thought you were keeping the sun from your eyes.
Christ no!
I said I was sorry.
Yeah, sure.  You got change?
All right, old man.  Christ.
Never heard of it.  It's got no day or date.  Hell, it ain't even got numbers.  What's the matter?  You couldn't afford a Timex?
You Harlin?
Harlin around?
Yeah, well, I've been around the bend a bit.
You've been there?
You believe that?
That's a good piece of advice, Darrell.
Listen, Darrell, about that hundred- fifty bucks for the car, as soon as I get where I'm going I swear I'll--
What?
You said this morning the hose was going to run me one-fifty.
I didn't tell you to replace any gasket.
I didn't tell you to do it!  You can't just do unauthorized work.
What reputation?  You're nothing but an ignorant, inbred, tumble weed hick.
Listen you stupid fuck, I want my car.
I'm taking my car, and I'm taking it now!
Baby didn't die.  Just froze off all it's finger and toes.  Just a little fingerless, toeless boy now.  But the husband; he sees what the wife's done, so after he saves the baby he locks the wife in the refrigerator to see how she likes it.  Now she died.
Who the hell is this!?
You sure you can manage?
Do you want me to carry your pack for you?
It tells me what every face tells me.  Everybody has a past, they have a pain, and they have something they want.  What is it you want?
From here?  I don't know.  Far.  Far enough.
Yeah.
Beautiful.  Beautiful beaches.  Blue water and clear skies as far as you can see.
I can't.
Grace, I can't.  I can't even get out of here myself.  I need a hundred-fifty bucks to get my car back from that crazy mechanic.
Where?
You think Jake's going to give me money just so I can take you out of here?
From?
You live pretty good.
How much money has he got?
One-hundred-thousand!?  That son-of- a-bitch lied to me.
I . . . nothing.  Just something he said.  So if the money's in a safe we'd have to get the combination--
If the key's on him, to get the key we'd have to . . .
We're going all the way.  Together.
Just drive.
I'm her husband.
Now who the hell are you, and it better be good, or God help me I'll break you in half.
Didn't much look like you were hanging drapes.
A lot that means.
I do all right.  Real estate isn't a bad game such as it is around here. The trick is to underestimate the price when you buy it, and overvalue when you sell.  You can turn a few dollars that way.
Trouble with the car again?
Darrell giving you problems?
Fifty dollars more.  That's a lot of money when you don't have a dime. And where'd you plan on getting the money from?  Maybe you thought you'd pay your friend Jake McKenna a visit.
Maybe you heard old Jake's got some money stashed away and you thought you'd help yourself to a little.
You thought you'd come in here in the middle of the night and wham! Wail off and clock old Jake McKenna and turn his brains into wall paper.
And then with Jake out of the way you could borrow two-hundred dollars.  Or maybe two-thousand.  Or twenty-thousand.  Who's to stop you? Not Jake McKenna, 'cause old Jake would be dead.
There's another reason?  It better be good.
You came to take my wife from me?
Liar.
That's a thick change of heart.
That's a lot of talk.  A whole lot of talk.
For what?
I hate to bust your bubble, but I wasn't defending you.
I wasn't going to fight for you.  I was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend.
Get it through your head, little girl; I'm not going for you.  If this Toby likes you, then if I were you I'd marry him.  You're not going to get much better in this town.
How old are you?
No, I don't want to take you for a ride.  What I want is for . . . Hey, you don't happen to have a hundred and fifty dollars I could--
What the hell are you doing?  Are you crazy?
You stupid punk!  You don't even know what you're fighting over!
Not taking a drive, Sheriff. Heading out of town.
Sheriff, he didn't give me any choice.  If I hadn't defended myself- -
Is there a problem up the road, Sheriff?
You want something, old man?
You want something?
You can't do that yourself?
I'm sorry, I didn't--
I don't know.  I thought you were keeping the sun out of your eyes.
Christ no!
I said I was sorry.
Yeah, sure.  You got change?
All right, old man.  Christ.
Things ain't always the way they seem. You got to ask yourself: is it worth it? Day comes Earthmaker is going to look in your fucking heart! Then you better know what it is you're doing. <u>Are you a human being</u> -- or just one of them hungry ghosts out there floatin' around?
Who the hell are you?
How do you know if you've never tried?
I like Darrell.  He may be an idiot, but he's my half brother. We own Harlin's together, yeah, that little redneck manages to get paid no matter how things work out.
For what?
I hate to bust your bubble honey, but I wasn't defending you.
I wasn't going to fight for you.  I was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend.
Get it through your head, little girl; I'm not going for you.  If this Toby likes you, then if I were you I'd marry him.  You're not going to get much better in this town.
How old are you?
No, I don't want to take you for a ride. What I want is for ... Hey, you don't think you can get $150 from your parents, could you?
You got to be more careful. Hands is important.  Let me show you something. When I was a kid, now I don't know if you can still see it, but I gashed my fingers in a lawnmower.
Diner up a piece.  Not much, but us simple folk like it.
Open up!
No trouble at all, really.
Nothing like a little liveliness.
He <u>was</u> a Shaman...in the mine. We had nothin' after he died. Jake took us in, gave us a little money. He used to call me his "little halfbreed"... He kept Mom on the side y'know, cause he was married someplace else. He had kids in Phoenix I think, no one knew him around here...but the thing was...you see...  ...he was raping me the whole time...for years. He loved to do things to me. Believe it or not, he used to say he was in love with my ass. Y'ever been in love with a woman's ass?
I came back for you; this morning I came back.  Before I even knew about the money. You're what I want.  The only reason I stormed off is because you spooked me talking about Jake.  But I've had nothing but time to think about it.  It keeps coming back to you and me and us getting the hell out of here.  But we've got to get the money, baby.  We get the money, I get the car, then we get the hell out.
We don't have to kill him.  Just knock him out and tie him up 'till we get away.  It was your idea, remember?  I'm doing this for you.  I'm doing this so you can fly...fly like a bird.
You think now that Jake's dead, there's all that money there and I don't need you anymore, and I might just sneak up behind you sometime and...pop!
He <u>can't</u> help you now, honey!
The ticket is 30.55.
No baby, you got it wrong.
Like you helped her, Jake?
Ask if he can check how many sick days I've taken since I've worked here?
Yes.
No that's it.
Jeremy what the hell are you doing?
You assumed wrong.
But not a knife?
I'm very proud of him.  He's been through a lot in his life. A lot of ups and downs, a lot of bad spells. A couple I'd thought had broken him... I mean emotionally.  They were bad... But he made it. Yes he did.
Yes he is.
I lied.
It's my field. I represent athletes. I'm an agent.
Is that right?
...See my husband was a big football star in college and we were in an accident together. Our car flipped on an icy road. We were both injured. He couldn't play football anymore.  If that hadn't happened, we wouldn't have been together.
Football wasn't the kind of life I wanted... For ten years I'd be by the phone waiting for a call telling me he broke his neck in a practice game. And if it wasn't that call, it would be a call telling me he blew out his knee or suffered his third concussion. I've seen way too much of it in my job... I can barely take it when my clients are in pain.  I don't hate the game. I admire the amount of skill it involved and, like everyone else, I was in awe of how he could play it, but I couldn't give him my heart and then have something happen to him. And it always does with that game.  It's not a thing many people would understand.
Any way, fate stepped in and took football out of the equation.
Innocent of what?
Little Bill come out of Kansas an' Texas, boys. He worked them tough towns.
I... I guess not.  I didn't mean I didn't want one 'cause of you bein' cut up. I didn't mean that.
No?
Property.
You figure nobody'll want to fuck her.
N-no. I wr-wr-wr-write... I wr- wrwrite...
Did you... kill him?
I'm a damn killer myself, only I ain't killed so many as you because of my youth. Schofield Kid, they call me.
On account of my Schofield model Smith and Wesson pistol.
Well, how about it?
Bein' my partner. I'm headin' North up around the Niobrara in Nebraska. Gonna kill a couple of no good cowboys.
For cuttin' up a lady. They cut up her face an' cut her eyes out, cut her ears off an' her tits too.
Thousand dollars of reward. Five hundred a piece.
You boys are crotchety as a couple of hens.
You still think he's in there?
Well, he's holding on to his shit like it was money.
Tell me right off if you see him.
You... you ain't gonna shoot him yourownself?
Well, you don't wanna trust me too much. We'll take Ned his share together so you don't figure I run off with it.
Yup. You still got the Spencer rifle?
Fifty yards ain't bad.  Guess we better get along.
Supposin' he don't go to the ranch?
I ain't waitin', Bill.  I'll look in on your youngsters when I get back.
Oh, them.  Hell, I seen them.
I've been looking all over for you. You still after the coke that walked out of that blood bath in the harbor?
You can stop looking. There was no coke. I've been in L.A. county with a guy they
Just forget about it.
So why the hell was I hauled in and cavity searched tonight?
I had a guy's fingers in my asshole tonight.
How do I know that? How about it, pretzel-man? What's your story?
I wanted to talk to you. The other guys -
They're gonna do a job. Three million dollars, maybe more.
Don't do this. Send her a card - something.
Mr. Soze made a few calls, yes. You were not to be released until I came to see you. It seems Mr. Keaton's attorney, Ms. Finneran, was a bit too effective in expediting his release. Holding the rest of you became a moot point.
Mr. Redfoot knew nothing. Mr. Soze rarely                 t works with the same people for very long, and they never know who they're working for. One cannot be betrayed if one has no people.
You didn't know.
Kobayashi.
Let me tell you something. I know Dean Keaton. I've been investigating him for three years. The guy I know is a cold-                    + blooded bastard. L.A.P.D. indicted him on three counts of murder before he was kicked off the force, so don't sell me the hooker with the heart of gold.                        +
Do I? Keaton was under indictment a total                 + of seven times when he was on the force.                  + In every case, witnesses either reversed                  + their testimony to the grand jury or died                 + before they could testify. When they                      t finally did nail him for fraud, he spent                  + five years in Sing Sing. He killed three prisoners inside - one with a knife in the tailbone while he strangled him to death. Of course I can't prove this but I can't prove the best part either.
McManus was furious. He was talking about tracking him down and ripping his heart out and all sorts of shit. That night we got the call.
Kobayashi told us where we could find Fenster.
THE KIND OF MAN THAT COULD HAVE KILLED EDIE FINNERAN.
Accused.  Not indicted.  He resigned the firm.  Divorced nineteen seventy.  Galvin worked with Michael Morrissey until Morrissey retired in 'seventy-eight.  Since then he's been on his own.  Four cases before the Circuit Court.  He lost them all.  He drinks.
The man's an ambulance chaser ...
This is a nuisance suit.  He's looking for small change.  He's asking for six hundred thousand and betting we don't want to go to court.
Neither does he.  That's where he loses.  This man's scared to death to go to court.  We only have to call his bluff.
No.  Absolutely, and we're going to see that it is not.
All right.  But let's keep the price down.  I've called Ed Concannon.  He recommends that we continue to respond as if we're going to trial.
Yes.
I was her doctor.
...I was one of a group of...
Yes.
Yes.
Huh!
I doubt we'll have to go to trial ...
I completely understand ...
That's what I'd planned to...
From what I've seen, Mr. Galvin, you have a very good case...
...I made a reservation at...
...What difference would...
There's nothing they can do to me.
Why?
...things change.
I wasn't disbarred, they dropped the pro...
I'm sure you would.
Overruled...
Noted.  Thank you.   Miss Costello was a rebuttal witness.  Her sole rebuttal was the document,  which has been disallowed...
Isn't there something you...
You're talking like a drunk.
...I'm going to need your help...
I'm going to help her.
They killed her.  And they're trying to buy it...
I'm swell.
Yeah.
I don't know.
You're really...  You, are you the one they told me was the nurse?
Mrs...
Yes.
That's a wonderful profession.  My daughter-in-law's a nurse.  What did you do, stop?
Should I?
Yes.
The Big Boy did...?
Huh.
Me, too.
Well?
Have you talked to the doctors at all?
I can get you a firm of private eyes to follow her for you. They're dependable, good boys --
It's not my line.
What about?
Why?
No, there. There's a good one. Do you like that?
Yes. Yes, I do.
I feel like driving. Are you terrible hungry?
What are you going to do?
Oh! Yes! Here!
Good-bye.
Long ago...
All the time.
You can't.
Let me go.
To the church, I must go there.
Please let me go.
More than you think.
Please!  And what happens after tomorrow?
What are you going to do? Now that you've quit the police force?
No, it's your life. But you were the bright young lawyer who decided he was going to be chief of police some day.
Why?
It wasn't your fault.
Johnny, the doctors explained --
Well, you've got it. And there's no losing it. And there's no one to blame. So why quit?
It's where you belong.
Ah, Johnny-O...
Well, who? Come on, you know everybody.
Not that kind of history. The small stuff! About people you never heard of!
Yeah.
Who?
Who shot who in the Embarcadero in August, 1879.
Wandering.
I need a drink.
She's dead.
I'm not getting a ticket.
There's more.
Just giving the facts.
What were we doing officer? Why didn't we help her? Well...we're all a bit high, you know, bachelor party, that kind of thing. Fisher here is getting married in three days...Beautiful wife ...he didn't have anything at all to do with it...It was all Micheal here... just Micheal...
We are all going straight to hell. Either hell or prison, whichever comes first.
There is no candy!
Jesus Adam, can we not get into this now please?
I got you.
Where is she?
Left side.
Prison Communication Systems.  An acquaintance friend of mine is professionally involved with a communications outfit in Denver that I just happen to know for a fact is about to be rewarded a very large, exclusive contract to rewire every state prison in Colorado. Yes sir.
No, this is the perfect time. This is real time. Adam. Your brother and I, as well as several others present, have always suspected that you...  ...are a fully repressed, living in major denial, locked down, fly-boy butt-fucker.
I don't think that's such a good idea.
What are you going to do?
What does that mean?
I don't know...
You hate women.
True.
You have a King fantasy.
And what happens when you can't?
Goosed!
Why? What's his problem?
He's weird. And I expect more from you.
You're going to be hungover for three days. Like those guys on "Oprah" that get drunk and have disgusting sex with prostitutes and then say their vows with the stench of cheap hotel whore sex all over them.
It's vile!
"At first I thought it was infatuation ...But oh it's lasted so long..."
What does that mean?
Like how?
The only proof is those bodies.
Move the bodies.
Just go ahead and say what's on your mind.
Did she believe you?
You can tell when people believe you. It's obvious.
Okay great. What will that be?
What song?
Oh I know that. How does it go...
I don't think that's a good idea.
What's that?
What about them?
Nothing. I didn't say anything.
Wasn't that cowardice?
I have asked her but she's ungrateful. Sometimes I feel like hitting her. When I talk to her about the convent, she turns to stone.
Fifteen yards.
That's it.
No, not mad at all: she's rotten with religion.
There's plenty of money in this house. Piles of it.
It's about time we spoke to each other, isn't it?
If I wait until tomorrow, it'll be the same as yesterday and the day before and all the other days. When you're not with your poor people, you're praying or you disappear, I never see you.
Then let him go and he'll follow you.
Very, very?
He couldn't get through the door, then?
The retreat will start soon. You can leave tomorrow morning.
Don't pay any attention to him. It's very good.
Can you tell us what's on the disc?
Madison lives two blocks from their present location.
I don't know.
Their weapons missing?
Where's my gun?
Letting a lunatic like Parker Barnes loose in the free world is like lighting a fuse. At some point, he will go off -- you saw what happened in the simulator. The risk to the public is unacceptably dangerous.
The man played judge, jury, and executioner with eight people's lives. He lost control and is capable of doing it again.
He hears...everything.
True genius is rarely rewarded within its lifetime.
It was me, what?
I couldn't just let them make you bring down my degree of difficulty. I'm a triple-twisting, double back flip off the high platform, not a swan dive.
Which God would that be, the one who created me, or the one who created you?  In your world, the Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away. But in my world, the one who gave me life doesn't have the balls to stop a couple of bureaucratic assholes from taking it away.
I had something a little different in mind.  Instead of just playing Peeping Tom with Reilly, why don't you get him to show you what he's been working on after hours?
It wasn't a lie.
... here on earth to create havoc and terror. I am War, I am death. I am destruction. David Berkowitz, 1977.
For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak with most miraculous organ.
Hamlet.  What's David Berkowitz got to do with Sid 6.7?
This is my area of expertise.
They're going to fry me for it, anyway.
Lindenmeyer never got over wanting to kill kids with more musical than he had...
Let me put it to you this way... whether I'm here... or whether I'm not...I'm leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night.
For Schumann.
Listen to what I've ... listen to... does anybody know Morse Code?
Shot down, Forced down...  You guys are <u>missing</u> it... You're missing the <u>opportunity</u>
Okay, look, who's takin' the press conference today?
It's like that thing with the Yellow Ribbon...
The Hostages...?
In the yellow ribbon.
The Ribbon Manufacturers.
You missed your <u>plane</u>?  My <u>life</u> is over.  My <u>life</u> is over.  What have you <u>done</u> to me?  What have I done?  Fourteen years of Public Service...
...fourteen years...
Brazen it through?  Brazen it <u>through</u>?  They're going to hang us out to dry like the <u>laundry</u> --- do you know what we've <u>ddd</u>...
Well, you know, "The Whole Thing's Theatre..."
Any untoward "revelation" regarding, uh...
...we own it?
Where is he?
What do <u>you</u> think?  What I need from you:  I need a base of operations.  Some place in the District.  I need some clean <u>money</u> ...
Why Albania?
Did we ever use those costumes for the Border Patrol? Those guys in the Leopard-Skin <u>Hats</u>?  Here's my idea....
I got it in the inaugural.  "Thank you for voting for me, but, <u>as</u> importantly:  Thank you for <u>voting</u>... 
Might, if I was asked... 
What <u>kind</u> of stuff?  Hello...?
They'll be here in ten minutes.
Too Texan.  Go with the stick.  Thanks.  <u>What</u>...? ...does it have to be <u>Albania</u>...We're locked into Albania...why?
Leopard Skin...
Well, you  said it yourself, earlier, and if I may rephrase, that the success of the President, in the Polls...
Eighty-<u>nine</u> percent favorable, is based not on <u>events</u>...
...this is nothing.  This is nothing. D'you ever shoot in <u>Italy</u>?  Try three Italian starlets on Benzedrine, this is a walk in the park...
Sell it all.  What the hell, so I'll only make ten million.
You mean teach you how to play. Can't. Going fly fishing in Canada, big client...
...light snack, but good, thanks pal, you're sharking your way up...
Marv,  ...I just bagged the elephant!
How's Mom?
You speak for me, son.
Like? Uh...hmmm. Well...
Let's see, it closed at uh, 41 1/8...  Up a quarter...very attractive... about average yield...
A comer. 80 medium-body jets. 300 pilots, flies northeast, Canada, some Florida and Caribbean routes... great slots in major cities...
There was a crash last year. They just got a favorable ruling on a lawsuit. Even the plaintiffs don't know.
I don't understand.
Follow him? Mr. Gekko I...  It's not what I do. I could lose my license. If the SEC found out, I could go to jail. It's inside information, isn't it?
I think I got some friends that won't mind making some easy money...
Gordon.
I'm kidding, I'm kidding, we're still young, Darien. So what's money anyway when everybody's making it, it's all relative. After all, this is not the house in Connecticut, this is just a crash pad good for a couple of years...before we slip our two lovely kids, Yuppie and Fruppie into the Lycee Francaise.
That's right -- one with high yield, rich assets and no downside...
Why?
There came into Egypt a Pharoah who did not know.
No, it's a prophecy. The rich have been doing it to the poor since the beginning of time. The only difference between the Pyramids and the Empire State Building is that the Egyptians didn't have unions.  I know what this guy is about-- greed--he's in and out for the buck and he don't take prisoners. He don't give a damn about Northstar or us ...
Done. You'll hear from my lawyers. 8 a.m. Good night.
About what?  About us.
Right. CHINA I need a taking care of,  not `hey how bout a pizza after class babe'.  I'm looking  for something just a little more in a man.  A little `je nes se qua'.
I'm sorry I'm not that good at languages ok?
Suffer?  We're living in America.
Hello, Mrs. Webster.  Is China there?
No?
A party at a waxwork huh?
You don't happen to have the address do ya?
Well.   .this, is Mr. Lincoln.  And that's the man I saw at the waxwork.
Sell my soul?
You get yourself a regular job, as Satan's disciple.
No, he wouldn't.
That's not true.
How do you know it's a she?
What does she look like?
Do you have any idea who she is?
Fine.
Just fine.  It's a lovely party.
Who?  Your husband?
No.  No, I don't.
This is...
No, you're not.  But a presence in your house is not something to be taken lightly.
I've got to find a bathroom.  I'll call you.
I don't know...
No, no.  I'm just about...  There.
I'm telling you.  There was something in her voice...
Not like this.  We were never like this.  I want to go over there.  After dinner, we can--
To make sure she's all right.
What kind of whispering?
A flare?
It's her!  I'm telling you.  She whispered and turned on the music.  She's trying to contact me!
He killed her.  I'm not crazy.  He killed her and--
Yes.  And he's going to get away with it.
I felt you...looking through me...
You told me that I was...
Claire--
Oh God...
Nothing.
You don't have to do that.
Fine.  I'll do the shopping.
I wish everyone would stop commenting on my health.  I'm the doctor.
Michael, Rowan should -
I don't want it.
A Mayfair it ever I saw one.
I'm tired.  I need to rest.
Wind - I love you with that which is endless within me.  Bring me your eyes - your touch - your voice...
Always loved you..
But have I...?  Ever...?!
How is your heart, Father...? Is the Timex still ticking...?
Rowan...
Like this...?  LIKE THIS...?!
Ms. yin, and Mr. yang  Aha!
Wait a minute.  Rowan - what is going on...?
Let's see.
A little wine...?
A little sore.  Darm...   Finish up my section, will ya...?
Michael - please -  just. a little longer.  Don't leave.
Stop it!
You bastard!
Just don't fall off any ladders.
Well I'm glad I'm not them - what are you doing here so late? Come to that, what the hell have you got that for?
Yes - I have had it for years.
And how many people have you killed?
You don't know?
Where do you kill them...
my car  I stopped working from my car.  She could have stopped me you know - If she really wanted too. That is the difference between the confusion of humanity and the purity of the beast - If a dog attacked you - you could easily kill it without any damage to yourself - Why then do people get bitten by dogs - savaged? Why?
Because a dog will attack with a ferocity and force that we poses, but centuries of social contamination has run it out of us - that is what sets us aside from the purity of the beasts...Society is rotting - men who once were strong and kept everything working are getting soft - women are making them soft - by the time a pretty girl has reached twenty - she has had three lifetimes worth of fun and attention- so she doesn't deserve any more -
No she didn't...
You know everyone accuses me of being sick - the press, the TV - but I'm not you know - they are - I don't watch it for entertainment every night - I don't sit and watch it whilst eating my dinner - they all say, how could he cut her up? She was dead - I can't hurt something dead - And all this whilst they slobber down their processed beef burgers by the dozen - I couldn't eat one of those burgers, you don't know what has gone in them! 
Did you?
LESLIE I'm sorry - I - I didn't know what to think
It's what you would do to me
At home alone - where were you?
Get out...
Yes...?
That's crazy talk.
This isn't some 80's porno film, you dip shit. There are no wild sex orgies.
Not ever. Never.
Yeah, he's probably been serving cocktails, SO TO SPEAK, at the orgies.
Let me get this straight...
These are real, live women?
God, I love being dead.
Which you pulled, hard!
We miss you. We miss our son.
You ordered a Winnebago?
I always knew there was more. I felt it.
Look, the girls of Xenia are gorgeous, you'll see. Next month we'll be back to normal.
Are you kidding? Mom and Dad discover I'm gone and I'll be doing hard time.
Aside from the fact that Mom's eyes are nearly swollen shut from crying and Dad spends all his time under the car trying to fix stuff that isn't broken, things couldn't be better.
You can't come back. That is, you can, but your things will be in the room you currently think of as mine.
Funny you should say that. My Grandfather was a peach farmer.
Then I'll write about YOU.
"Local boy inherits more money than god." Call me crazy, but I smell human interest.
In a word: MERK. EXPOSED.
There's gotta be something. We have to dig deeper.
He shut down your paper!  You're stuck writing articles about swap meets and raffles and PTA brunches!
Very ambitious. I like that.
I know where you can find any number of naked girls who'd love to hop on board.
But how would we pay our bills?
Uh, sure. Uncle Billy.
I was like a different person tonight.
I would have been laughed right out of Xenia.
It's really going to be strange going home in a couple of days.
Really? You'd do that for me?
You seem like you're anything but lazy, Uncle Billy.
My parents always say hard work builds character.
What kind of ideas?
You think we should be more open minded?
In other words, our scope is too narrow.
That's perfect.
My job. Back off, Benedict.
I... You know... I...
And the child...
Suzie.  Then you're not her grandmother...
She didn't cone home last night.  We found her car at the bus terminal, but nothing to suggest she bought a ticket.
Ray thinks she was murdered.
It's a shithole.  But she was dirty, what was I gonna do?
Ray.  We don't know anything yet.  She could be anywhere...
We need to tape the interview, Suzie. No one will see it but us.  Now when was this, that Mr. Lombardo gave you the ride?
You think this is just about money, about us looking foolish?  Question him. You're gonna find a stone cold manipulative psychopath.  And those girls are going to wind up dead...
I'm sorry?
Oh, for Christ's sake.
Are you retarded, or just brain dead from whiffin' fumes out there in the swamp...
Hi, Mon.
No I didn't.  Check out the Jeep.  It's nice and dirty for you.  But you might want to wait a minute. The Mercedes is leaving.
Yes.
Why can't you come...
You know what it takes.
Not in here.  Chiropractor comes in here for lunch sometimes.
You got something against cigarettes?
It is and I don't.  Ordinarily...  But, I mean... there's this kid standing in front of you crying...
Good.  Just keep telling yourselves that, the only people who can fuck this up is us.
Listen, Kelly skipped school.  Have you talked to her?
Shit. Here we go again.
To tell you the truth, I haven't seen her since Friday.
Well... it's the only one I have. It's gotten me out of quite a few tight spots...
You're either having a seizure or you just said "hello."
I thought all you needed were your fists and your gun.
That rules out Willard, Vermont; Willard, Minnesota...  Willard, New Mexico?
Of course not.
But it only has six legs.
I don't like to lose, either.
I would, Mr. Doyle!  Are you game?
He didn't.  That's your job.  I'm taking you off that other case until you've nabbed this lunatic. Good luck.  Nice train.  But mine's nicer.
Exactly!  You are on foreign soil. You are a representative of the occupying forces.  Or haven't you checked a map lately?!
It is?
Then come with us.
Anything you hurl them at will turn to stone.
Too bad you're not more like your father.
Can you use your magic to get our men into the fortress, Raziel?
Friend of yours?
I thought you had her!
Well what did she say?
What a great son you are, Ranon.  I wish I could take you with me.  Now go to sleep...
I must concetrate my imagination...to creat a new...reality!
The limitless power of...
More!  More!
Us??  We'll never catch them.  Any- way, we're all done, Teemo.  Let's go home.
I can't see anything--she's too bright!
Upstairs, asleep. Where'd you think?
That's none of your goddamn business! So keep your goddamn holier-than- thou mouth shut!  Anyway, they like Fred.
No... I saw the man who killed him.
A hot shower... I haven't changed clothes in two days.
No you're not   You're glad, because now you've got a witness.  I heard the other police talking last night.  They don't seem to like you very much.
I would not be too sure.
The leadership of our district... the diener. Bishop Tschantz is the one with no hair on top. They decided to come and see you for themselves. Except Stoltzfus, of course. He came the first day. I think he saved your life.
Oh?  What happened to Hochstetler?
A real fireball.
What the hell are you talking about? What's happening.
Johnny, what the fuck?
Yes, thank you very much.
Yes.
You are acting like one!
No! They will be the judge of that! And so will I... if you shame me!
Of course not. We're going to Baltimore. It's much nicer in Baltimore.
I know, but we all got to work out our own problems, Henry.
Oh, I hope we got them in time.
Do you presume to criticize the....
That's a good little girl.  I knew you'd see reason.
Yes.  Say goodbye, Toto.
Has it poppies on the wall....
Oh...
What sort of an animal is that?
Oh --  Goodbye, Lion.  You know, I know it isn't right, but I'm going to miss the way you used to holler for help before you found your courage.
It's the Witch!  She's followed us here!
Did they hurtcha?
Oh -- does it hurt you?
Ohhh --
Oh, you don't think we're going to stand by and let her get away with fireballs and bees, do you?
Oh -- are you -- are you all right?
Don't you start it, too!
This way!  Come on!
Yeah --
B-B-B-B-B-But if we do that, we'll have to kill her to get it!
Dorothy!
Now, now, don't fret.
We'll get you together!
You promised us real things -- a real...
With this?
Like riding a bike.
Shes not a girl anymore.
Which is neutral, no doubt.
Im sorry.
I know.
I used my body on the guards.  It gave me control. I got to a gun and I took my chance.  Ive never told anyone that.
It is my oil!  Mine and my familys!
You are out of your league.  Shes working with Renard.
What class sub does your nephew run?
Yes.  Au revoir...
You oughta see upstairs.  It's a slaughterhouse.
Small army, from the looks of it.  He put up one hell of a fight.
You mean Afghanistan?  It won't require my attention.  What I'm doing here is far more interesting.
Always.  Ever since the day I died.
I don't know, but . . . in the wake of all that's happened, I'm starting to think Rorschach may have been right.  Is Laurie okay?
Good.  Be careful, Daniel, don't let up your guard.  Look, I'm going to head south for a while -- hole up at Karnak until all this blows over.  You two would be welcome to join me.
Oh, yeah.  They gave me a clean bill of health and then booted me the hell out.  No expense account.  No place to live.
I know what you're thinking.  You'd be a lot safer if I weren't around.
I'm an open target, Dan.  If you're with me --
The costumes.  Am I right?
Did anybody follow you?  See you come here?
Okay, let's just . . . thank you.
I don't know their real names.
I don't know their real names!
Then why don't you ask him?!?
ALL RIGHT!  ALL RIGHT!!  -- How'd you find me?
You're a cold piece of work. You almost got three people killed out there.
You're a grungy little phoenix, you know that? Keep up the good work.
We're anti-social. We don't have any friends.
Why are you still hanging around? Your business is finished, you should go home.
I don't know who you are or where you come from, but I don't like you. You ask too many questions.
No, something worse. He says it's a surprise, but I know him. This is his masterpiece.
There's something I didn't have time to tell you before.
I'm a agent as well. KGB. I've been undercover for over a year.
I don't know. Eight months ago I stop hearing from my people. No explanation, just silence. So I stay and I wait like I was told. Soon I'm in so far, they'd kill me if I left. Now every day I get farther and farther away from what I was. I'm like you said, a criminal.
Go to the water, it's that way!
Nice place to start, don't you think?
I was gonna wait till the islands, but...
Of course I'm serious. I bought it, didn't I?
I don't know. I thought this is what you wanted. You want stability, here it is.
You're not exactly "going anywhere" yourself.
He's a pretty good actor, though.
Of course.
I wanted to get the hell out of Prague before Silent Night falls.
His vital signs are weak and getting weaker.
Sure you are, sport.
I presume nothing, I am here to tell you that in time, the mutator gene will activate in every living human being on this planet.  Perhaps even your children, Senator.
In the road to survival, there is always sacrifice Logan.  We are the future... not them.  We must protect ourselves.  After tonight, when the leaders of the world return home -- They will return as brothers, as mutants... and our cause will be theirs.  This is survival, I know you understand that, Logan... or is it Wolverine?
What?... miss me?  Charley, I'm gonna walk out the front door and trust me, it won't be soon enough for everyone here.
I know.
He has a big mouth.  Yes!  It seems to me I did read something about that incident as a student.  But you have to remember that a worm -- with very few exceptions -- is not a human being.
Hello...?
Well... yes.
I...
No, of course not.  I just meant...
This wire came while you were gone. Your fiancee will be arriving any moment.
A piece of what?
Are you speaking of the worm, or ... the spaghetti.
What wockers?
Wockers with the knockers???
Could be worse!
Could be raining!
You mustn't take it so hard. Bucharest wasn't built in a day.
... I'm glad that's...
... Whew!  I'm glad that's over with.
It's alive!
It's an honor for me, sir.  You play the violin?
What a filthy mess.
I think I'll...carry him.
Of course not.
There must have been someone else down here then.
Do Something!  Stall them!
I thought it might be more effective to find someone who speaks Zulu.
Yes.
Well, my horses are feeding, as you may observe, Mr Coghill. It'll take a little while.
Right.  Bombardier, to me please.
