1 You have my word.  As a gentleman	You're sweet.

1 do you listen to this crap?	What crap?
2 Me.  This endless ...blonde babble. I'm like, boring myself.	Thank God!  If I had to hear one more story about your coiffure...

1 Bianca, I don't think the highlights of dating Joey Dorsey are going to include door-opening and coat-holding.	Sometimes I wonder if the guys we're supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with, you know?
2 All I know is -- I'd give up my private line to go out with a guy like Joey.

1 I have the potential to smack the crap out of you if you don't get out of my way.	Can you at least start wearing a bra?

1 He said everyone was doing it.  So I did it.	You did what?
2 Just once.  Afterwards, I told him I didn't want to anymore.  I wasn't ready. He got pissed.  Then he broke up with me.

1 Daddy, people expect me to be there!	If Kat's not going, you're not going.

1 That girl -- I --	You burn, you pine, you perish?
2 Who is she?	Bianca Stratford.  Sophomore. Don't even think about it
3 Why not?	I could start with your haircut, but it doesn't matter.  She's not allowed to date until her older sister does.  And that's an impossibility.

1 Number one.  She hates smokers	It's a lung cancer issue
2 Her favorite uncle	Dead at forty-one.

1 Cameron, I'm a little busy	It's off. The whole thing.

1 Leave my sister alone.	And why would I do that?

1 I don't know, Dorsey. ..the limo.-the flowers.  Another hundred for the tux --	Enough with the Barbie n' Ken shit. I know.

1 So he has this huge raging fit about Sarah Lawrence and insists that I go to his male-dominated, puking frat boy, number one golf team school. I have no say at all.	William would never have gone to a state school.
2 William didn't even go to high school	That's never been proven
3 Neither has his heterosexuality.

1 You hate me don't you?	I don't really think you warrant that strong an emotion.
2 Then say you'll spend Dollar Night at the track with me.	And why would I do that?
3 Come on -- the ponies, the flat beer, you with money in your eyes, me with my hand on your ass...	You -- covered in my vomit.
4 Seven-thirty?

1 Why'd you let him get to you?	Who?
2 Dorsey.	I hate him.
3 I know.  It'd have to be a pretty big deal to get you to mainline tequila. You don't seem like the type.	Hey man. . .  You don ' t think I can be "cool"?  You don't think I can be "laid back" like everyone else?
4 I thought you were above all that	You know what they say

1 He left!  I sprung the dickhead and he cruised on me.	Look up, sunshine

1 How'd you get a tux at the last minute?	It's Scurvy's.  His date got convicted. Where'd you get the dress?
2 It's just something I had.  You know	Oh huh
3 Look, I'm  -- sorry -- that I questioned your motives.  I was wrong.

1 Was that your sister?	Yeah.  She left with some bikers Big ones.  Full of sperm.
2 Funny.

1 What plan?	The situation is, my man Cameron here has a major jones for Bianca Stratford.
2 What is it with this chick?  She have three tits?

1 I missed you.	It says here you exposed yourself to a group of freshmen girls.
2 It was a bratwurst.  I was eating lunch.	With the teeth of your zipper?

1 Have a great time, honey!	But -- who -- what --?

1 If God intended our proximity to Asia, do you believe he would have waited for you to show it to the world?	Did He not choose a carpenter's son to reveal Himself to the world?

1 I'm not asking you to swear to anything.	I don't want you to wait for me.
2 That's something you can't decide.

1 I want to go with you!	There'll be a time.
2 You promise?  Do you swear on St. Christopher...?

1 And were you never ambitious, Excellency?  Or is ambition only a virtue among the nobles, a fault for the rest of us?	If you won't accept our proposal, we'll simply find someone who will.

1 Chief says -- how many?	Thousands.
2 Why?

1 You mustn't give way to despair. You must wait.	Wait!  I've waited seven years already!  How much longer do you want me to wait?
2 If God intends you to go, then you will go.	Damn God!

1 The ocean is uncrossable?	What did they say about Granada before today?
2 That she was impregnable.

1 Don Moxica -- we all have to work.	You did not hear me, Don Colon.  Not my horse.

1 ... Into a monk...	Yes.  It would be a pity, wouldn't it?  Call him back!

1 Tell me about yourself.  What you did as a young boy... what your parents were like.	My father always degraded me.  Killed my self-esteem.  And my mother was blind.
2 Your mother was blind?	Yeah, she went blind giving birth to me. She went to fucking black market doctor to induce me.
3 Back in the Czech Republic?	Yeah, yeah...bad doctor gave her bad drugs which made her go blind.  And my father blamed me for her blindness...
4 Your father blamed you for your mother's blindness?	Yeah, he hated me from day when I was born.  Put it out.  Can you put the cigarette out?

1 I came here.  I had no money.  I knew no one.  I couldn't get a job because you have to have a green card to get work. They approached me - I could've made a lot of money.  I considered it, but... it's not who I am.  They pay me below the table at Ludwig's.	So you were never a prostitute?
2 What are you asking me?	I'm just trying to find out who you are.

1 Whether you tell us or not, we'll find out.  Better if it comes from you.	If I tell you, will you arrest me?
2 Arrest you for what?  Why would we arrest you?

1 Did the D.A. videotape her deposition?	Yeah.  He finished awhile ago.
2 Alright.  Swing by her apartment.  Let her pick up her clothes and take her straight to Hoover Street.  You got that?	Yeah.

1 He got my gun!  Motherfucker was filming the whole time!	I know.  Relax.  Take it easy.  Don't worry, we'll get those fuckers.

1 The Super said he'd seen her before but she didn't live here.	Pretty.
2 Hmmmm.	Maybe you don't care about that either.  Prettiest suspect I've had in awhile.
3 Who says she's a suspect?

1 Why not?	Something back home?

1 Detective, does it look like a murder?	We don't know that yet.  It's much too early.  There's a lot to be done.
2 How many victims are up there?	There are two bodies found at this point.
3 Can we go up to the crime scene?	You know you can't do that.  C'mon.
4 Is it drug related?	We don't know.  When I have more I'll let you know.

1 So we're waitin' to hit this warrant - we got Emergency Service with the heavy weapons standin' by - ready to go.  I say, lemme get a cigar outta the car.  I go to get the cigar and BOOM!  All the sudden I turn around and a kid with a shotgun let one go.  Right where I was standin'.  That coulda been it.  I coulda had my head blown off and for what?  Some stupid kid got panicky, takes the safety off and it's over.  If I hadn't gone back for that cigar - for a bad habit - I would've had my head blown off.	Jesus Christ.

1 Come to 45 Broadway.  Don't bring the Police.  Come alone or you'll be in my next film.	Look asshole.  I've been threatened by better than you.
2 No.  I'm the best that's ever threatened you.	I'll meet you on one condition - I get exclusivity and you surrender to me.
3 We'll talk about that.  Four o'clock gives you time to go to bank.  Three hundred thousand dollars.	What?  It doesn't work that way.
4 If you don't want my film - I'll call another show.  And they will show it.	Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.
5 Come alone.  Bring cash.  And we'll talk about surrendering.

1 Give me the address!!	Alright, alright - don't hurt me! Please, it's in my book, in my purse!

1 Look.  Times Square.  Just like in the movies!	Don't speak Russian!
2 Why?  Why do I always have to speak to you in Czech?	Because I don't like your ugly language. I heard enough of it in school!  Now speak Czech or English.  And don't fool around anymore.  You almost got us thrown out!

1 What is it?	The video of Milos and Tamina - I told you to erase it.
2 I did.	And the whore's murder?  You didn't erase that either, did you?  Don't lie, I won't be angry.
3 Why not?	Put the camera down, Oleg.

1 Why did you leave that stuff in about you being the director?	Because I am the director.  Don't you realize, if it wasn't for my film, for my talent, my idea to do this - no way would we be sitting here right now.
2 Your idea?  I thought it was my idea.

1 Viewer discretion advised!	You want the tape?  There it is!

1 What was that?	Evidence.  Of a homicide.

1 The smoke'll permeate your nostrils - burn 'em out.  Let it run.	But you knew that, right?

1 What are you gonna do?	Don't you get it?  He knew he was gonna get caught!  That's why he videotaped Eddie's murder - he thinks he's gonna get off.
2 Don't stoop to his level!

1 Hi. Frank... coming in, please.	Right. Just a sec.
2 Okay. 	Okay, come on down.

1 Hal?	Yes.

1 I suppose it's because you've been under a lot of stress, but have you forgotten that they're not supposed to be revived for another three months.	The antenna has to be replaced.
2 Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation.	It doesn't have to be, Hal. It's more dangerous to be out of touch with Earth. Let me have manual control, please.
3 I don't really agree with you, Dave. My on-board memory store is more than capable of handling all the mission requirements.

1 I'm at Space Station Five, darling. How are you?	I'm fine, Daddy. When are you coming home?

1 How do you do, Mr. Miller?	I'm terribly sorry. I was just on my way down to meet you. I saw your ship dock and I knew I had plenty of time, and I was on my way out of the office when, suddenly, the phone rang.

1 Dr. Floyd, how long do you think this can be kept under wraps?	I'm afraid it can and it will be kept under wraps as long as it is deemed to be necessary by the Council. And of course you know that the Council has requested that formal security oaths are to be obtained in writing from every- one who had any knowledge of this event. There must be adequate time for a full study to be made of the situation before any con- sideration can be given to making a public announcement.

1 Hal, have pod arms secure the component.	Roger.

1 Yeah.	Vodka.
2 Maybe you better have a Black Russian.	No, man, I think I'll have a vodka.

1 Hey, don't you think a hair stylists got any interest in gettin' it on?	Here you go sweetheart, throw it my way.

1 Where's ganz?	In the back.  Down the other corridor.

1 I don't need to hear your jive. I already got that department taken care of...	You got a girl... shit... the generosityof women never ceases to amaze me.

1 Who'd you call on the phone back at the booking station?	Just get in the car and keep your mouth shut.

1 I'm gonna enjoy this ... here, I'll even loan you my badge.	I thought you said bullshit and experience are all it takes.

1 Just tell me about the money.	Me and my bunch hit a dealer in the middle of a sale. It's the kind of money nobody ever reports stolen. I was sittin' pretty, livin' in the high cotton, then somebody fingered me for another job. ... Some psycho who's out there capping people with some cop's gun.
2 He's after your money.	You catch on real fast...Okay, Jack, let's talk deal. How much of my money you gonna let me keep?

1 You'd think the guy'd be smart enough to know he was being tailed.	Tryin' to save his girl, man. He's in another world.
2 If I was his size and had Ganz on my ass, I'd  just leave town.	I'm tellin' you the man's in love... he wants to be a hero for his girl.
3 Oh, yeah, does bein' in love make you stupid?

1 Where's luther?	Be polite. Say hello.  This is Candy.
2 Hello. And goodbye.

1 Hey, how'd my car get here?	I had it impounded.  Come on, we'll use it for haulin' you back to the slam.
2 Back to jail in my own car.  Ganz got away. Got all my money. It just don't seem right.	I don't know about you, but I could use a drink... I'll buy you one.  It'll be my good-bye present.

1 It's your money.  It'll be here in six months when you get out.	And you're tellin' me you don't want any of this cash?
2 That's right. Not my style, Reggie..	You are an awesomely weird cop. Sure wish there were more like you runnin' around out here.
3 No, you don't. If I ever get word of you steppin' over the line again, I'm gonna ventilate that suit of yours.	Spare met Jack. I'm into legit investments from here on in.

1 Where the Christ do you think you're going?	I'm taking my prisoner back to jail.

1 Bullshit red tape.	I'm heading out. How about you?

1 I'm all wet.	What's wrong with that?

1 Look, spare me the macho bullshit about your gun...	Bullshit?  I'll tell you about bullshit.  My gun's a real weapon in the hands of a real maniac who knows how to use it.  It isn't my macho bullshit that's killing people, my gun is ...
2 Look, Jack, if you make everything your personal responsibility, you'll turn into a bad cop.  It's not a practical way to function...	I didn't get burned, two cops did. Listen, I'll tell you about personnel responsibility.  I like to get the job done right.  And if I don't get my job done right... I'm for shit.
3 Here it comes again ... the sacred job...	That's right.  I'm not like you. I'm not gonna sit on my ass wondering what's right and what's wrong... There's a psycho out there killing people with my gun and I'm gonna get him.  Because it's my job. And if you don't get that...
4 I get that. The job first. Everything else, especially me, second. I get it. I don't like it.

1 What makes you think they were lesbians, or as you so quaintly put it, dykes?	Come on, they were a little old for a slumber party.
2 It might pay to reexamine a few of your more primitive notions.  I was in bed with a girlfriend watching TV last week, Jack, and one thing we know about me is I happen not to be a lesbian ... Now, if this Indian's girlfriend got upset when you came looking for him, it could just be she's still vulnerable to him.	So what?
3 When a guy hurts you, then comes back bleeding on his hands and knees, who knows, he might just be irrestible.	Hey, Come on, shrink time's over. They wouldn't go see some old girlfriend.
4 Oh, yeah, well look where you came when you were down and out.

1 What do you want?  What's goin' on?	Shut up.

1 How you doing, man?	Not bad, not bad.

1 Ikset-kiba.  Me imanetaba oum dalat!	You know exactly where they are!

1 She's not my bride, she's my fare. She's looking for this Vito Cornelius. According to the phone guide he lives here.	That's me.  But I don't know who she is... where did you find her?
2 She dropped in on me... holding this.

1 There's no light! You told me there were supposed to be four beams of light.	Yes, of course, but... The Stones are shut! They have to be open for it to work.
2 And you don't know how they open, is that what you are saying?	That's what I'm saying.

1 Father.  You sure she's the Supreme Being?	Absolutely sure There's the triple suns on her gloves!

1 She was taught to love the life of others... but not her own. You have to teach her to love if you want her to truly live!	I'll help her, I promise, but I think you should tell me where the Stones are!
2 Do you love her?	I... I don't know! We hardly know each other... it takes time!
3 I don't have time... I need to know.	Listen, the last time I admitted to a woman I loved her ... I never saw her again.
4 I would like to have died in peace...

1 Daya deo dono Dato.  Dalutan!	It there's one thing I don't need advice on, it's how to drive.

1 Other than that... You all right?	...And now you're making fun of me? I'm warning you! If you don't take me after all these years of sacrifice, I'll never forgive you!!

1 ...Hi.	Does it get any better or what!

1 Solid little jobs, aren't they?	Dear listeners, your favorite DJ is alive and kicking. It's seven o'clock and time for the news. Tune in tomorrow for another adventure.

1 Apipoulai!	I suppose that means "Hi" ?

1 Where you going?	I'm going to see the Diva sing. What's the matter?... Do I look bad?
2 No, not at all!  I mean, just the opposite, you're... you're beautiful!

1 At least I won lunch.	Good philosophy..see good in bad.. I like..I prepare number one dessert.. special for you and pussy..

1 I managed to contact the Mondoshawan. They deplore the incident, but accept our apologies.	And the Stones?  Did you find them in the wreckage?
2 The-Stones weren't aboard the ship.	...What do you mean?

1 Drink!	To fame.. salud..

1 You think you'll have time for the water heater this weekend?	Sure.  I'll call the guy.
2 You're not using the same guy who tried to fix it?	I'm not using him again for anything.  He was worthless.  You have bridge here Saturday?
3 Betty's out of town so we're playing next week.

1 What are these?	Mixed hard bondage.  Rape films. Sick shit.  Buy five, get one free.

1 I'll do this for you.  Fifteen thousand dollars.	Machine's in?
2 He's in.  It will be his pleasure.

1 Is that him?	Put the gun down, take the handcuffs.  Handcuff yourself to the bed.

1 What's he talking about?	One million dollars, Dino.  How much did he tell you he had...

1 Do it.	Don't think I won't.
2 Do it!  Put me out of my misery so I don't have to listen to you whining anymore.  You think it's so easy?	Easy enough for you.
3 I never killed anyone.	That's right, you just stood there and watched, because you "felt like it."  Almost makes you worse.
4 What do you want?  You want me to fall to my knees and start crying like a baby... ?

1 He's lying.	Look at him.  You think he played it square?  How much did he give you, how much did he keep for himself?

1 How old are you?	Twenty-five.
2 Where are your parents?	I don't know, where are yours?
3 I don't mean any offense... but what are you doing mixed up in all this?	I'm not mixed up in anything, hayseed.  What are you talking about?
4 You just strike me as smart enough to be doing something else.	Yeah, I'm a real genius.  What choices have I got?  Fuck, just because I know about stuff like tonight doesn't mean I deal it.  I work a job.  It beats pumping gas, beats making hamburgers.
5 You're telling me it doesn't get to you?	You can't sit there all day watching the parade of losers that comes into that place without going numb.  So what? Am I gonna go off and be a race car driver?  Go to Harvard?  Run for President?  What about you, pops?
6 What about me?	I see a ring on your finger.  You have any kids?
7 A daughter.	So, you have a wife and kid waiting for you in Pennsylvania... what are you doing mixed up in all this?
8 Good question.

1 Look... that's awful generous and everything...	It's not my money.  The woman I got it from is never going to give it a second thought.  Let's not make a big deal out of this, okay?  Go be a race car driver.  Go run for President.  Whatever.

1 It's a film... of a girl being murdered.	I'm afraid I don't...
2 This is a movie showing a girl being murdered.  She's sitting on a bed, and a man rapes her... and he begins to cut her with a knife...  I only watched what I could.

1 Yes... ?	Hello, Mrs. Mathews, my name's Thomas Jones, I'm a state licensed investigator...

1 How... how can you say that to me...?	Will you let me look?
2 My husband never laid a hand on her. She would have told me... she would have told me...	You're probably right, and I probably won't find anything. I don't have a right to ask this, and you can kick me out of your house if you want, but this is my profession and there's a part of me that can't let it go.  Police are just as human as you or I.  They could have missed something.  They probably didn't.  Wouldn't you rather know?

1 Your son-in-law dealt with the dry cleaning franchise during the day, saw that woman every night.  The specifics are in the report, and information about the woman.  It's unpleasant, I know.  I apologize...	None too discreet, is he?
2 No, sir, he is not.	He's an imbecile.  I tried to warn my daughter, but what can you do?

1 I heard you screaming.  Was it a bad one?	It was bad.
2 Doesn't the dream master work for you anymore?	I can't find him.

1 You in a hurry?	I gotta get to the library before it closes.  Killer physics test.
2 I know.  I hardly have any time to study.	Maybe you shouldn't be working here so much.  You don't want to get stuck waiting tables for the rest of your life.
3 I know.

1 Alright, let's assume this whole thing is true. Why does Freddy all of a sudden need you?	Kristen was the last child left of the people who killed Freddy.  Maybe Freddy can't get to new kids without someone like me.  Someone to bring them to him.

1 I think Sheila's more interested in dissecting bodies than just admiring them.	Give her time.  Beauty is skin deep.

1 I'm sorry honey, but...	Sorry!! Sorry that you and your tennis pals torched this guy who's now after me. In case you haven't been keeping score, it's his fucking banquet, and I'm the LAST COURSE!!
2 Honey, we went over this in therapy.	Mother, you've just murdered me.  Take that to your goddamn therapy...

1 In your present condition, Alice, we're worried about your ability --	What are you talking about?  My "condition"?...

1 Mommy...?	Come on downstairs.  He won't hurt you. He needs us both.

1 Dad!	It's the model you've been saving up for. I wanted you to have it for your trip.

1 Did everyone call everyone?	They're waiting for us...but let's keep this dream stuff between you and me.

1 Are you alright?	Yeah...So that's him.  And you're not crazy.

1 Mark, are you okay?	Yeah.  I'm just aces.

1 I couldn't do that, Mark.  He's my last link with Dan...No, I want him.	Then we'll find another way.

1 Oh man!  I could've gone all night without looking at that.	I don't believe this... All that gore you paint in the comics and you're squeamish?

1 It's okay.	Stick around, please?

1 However our ideas disagree, as I've said before, I'm <u>not</u> a coward!  And it happens you've got no choice:  Either <u>I</u> take you down there, in the Lungfish, or you don't get there -	I'd sooner swim!

1 You've got to let us try, Skipper --	'Us?'
2 Reef and I can take the Explorer down, clamp it around the eye, and ---

1 Here - keep these.  It wants me to come alone.	Oh it does???

1 We read you!  Go ahead, Doctor!  They're inside the saucer.  It's filled with breathable air!	Wonderful!
2 That's wonderful, Carl!  Reef thinks they can clear the Shark bow so we can pull ourself loose!

1 Thought you were going to Washington, Skipper.	I did go.  Just back.  Reef, these are a couple of our passengers - Sir Ian Hunt, and Dr. Clifford Kent.  My exec, Commander Richard Holloway.
2 I met Dr. Kent, once.

1 Straight to the Pole - at almost fifty knots!	Nothing we can do, now.

1 My yeoman will show you to your quarters.	Thank you.

1 ...if Jack told the truth, he could be free by the time he's my age.	Sometimes things are simpler than you think. Let me ask you a question.
2 You don't believe me?	About Jack? No. Have you checked out the tax bill on your father's farm lately?
3 I know he's due for the last two years. I was thinking of paying it when the insurance comes in.	Has anybody offered to buy it?
4 As a mater of fact, yes. LaRiviere.

1 Done much shooting with that rifle yet?	Tell you what. You get me close to a big buck by ten, kid, there's another hundred bucks in it.
2 If you get it?	Yeah.
3 You might not kill it.	You think so.
4 You might gut-shoot it or cripple it for somebody else to find and tag. Can't guarantee that won't happen, especially with a new gun. I may have to shoot it.	You take care of your end, kid, I'll take care of mine.
5 Mmm.	You understand what I'm saying? I want a deer, a dead one, not a cripple or whatthefuck.
6 I get it.  No sweat. You'll get yourself a deer and you'll get him dead. And you'll have him by coffee time.	And you'll get your extra hundred bucks.
7 Wonderful!

1 Bastard's got his high beams on.	Shit.

1 Some party, huh? Sorry I lost sight of you. I had to step outside for a smoke. You find anybody you know here? There must be some kids you used to know from school. You want to go tomorrow? See your old teachers? Be more fun than hanging out with me all day.	No.
2 No what?	No I didn't see anybody I know. No I don't want to go to school here tomorrow. I want to go home.
3 You are home. There are lots of kids you still know here.	I don't want to be here. Don't worry, I love you, Daddy, I do. But I want to go home.
4 Jesus. Listen, Jill, tell you what. Tomorrow morning, you still want to go home, I'll drive you down. I'll get off work or something.	I called Mommy.
5 What? You called Mommy? Just now?	Yes.
6 Jesus, why?	I... because I want to go home. She said she'd come and get me.
7 Come and get you! Shit! It's a damn half hour drive each way. Why didn't you talk to me about it first?	See, I knew you'd be mad.
8 Yeah. Yeah, right, I'm mad. What'd you tell her, for Christ sake?	I told her I wanted to come home. Daddy, don't be mad at me.
9 Well, I guess I am. I planned this, I planned all this, you know. I mean, it's sort of pathetic, but I planned it. You shouldn't have called your mother.  C'mon, we're gonna call her before she leaves.

1 We're looking for the funniest costume! And the scariest! And the most imaginative! And the best costume of all!	Got here just in time. Go ahead. Jump in line. Maybe you'll win a prize.

1 What do I have to do for it?	Nothing, Wade, I've been thinking. You don't get enough appreciation around here and it's time we changed things a little.
2 I saw Mel Gordon in here this morning.	So?
3 He say anything about the summons I tried to give him? Sonofabitch wouldn't accept it.	Wade, that wasn't smart. Going out right after the man's father-in-law shot himself. Let it go. Call it a favor to me.
4 You? Why?	Mel's doing some business with me. It's nice to do favors for people you do business with. He was in a hurry. No big deal.
5 That was before Twombley was shot. Before he knew.	What's the difference? Take my truck, take a rest -- stop worrying about Mel Gordon. Have you decided what to do with your old man's place -- he going to stay there?
6 Want to buy?	Don't light that in here. I'm allergic.
7 I won't. You interested?	Maybe.
8 You and Mel Gordon?	Could be.
9 Always count on old Wade for a good screwing. Why should I always pay more, sell cheap? Why should you guys make all the money. You and Mel and Jack. Right's right.

1 New hat?  Jill's up, I see.	For a while.
2 How's she doing?	Okay. She's fine.
3 You two want to do anything tomorrow and need a third party, give me a call, okay? I'm off.

1 Are you sure they're home? Did you call?	The truck's here. Looks like they've stayed inside since the snow started.

1 I said, 'Next time, phone ahead.'	Jesus Christ. Mr. Gordon, when I come all the way to serve somebody a summons, I don't call ahead for an appointment.
2 What the hell are you talking about?	I'm issuing you a ticket. Moving violation.
3 Moving violation! I just got out of bed and you're telling me you're giving me a goddamn speeding ticket? Now? Are you nuts? Is that it, Whitehouse? You're nuts?	Yesterday morning, you passed a stopped school bus, which was flashing its lights, then you--
4 Hold on!	Don't ever put your hands on me, Mr. Gordon.
5 You're talking about a goddamned ticket, from when I passed you at the school where you were deciding to hold up traffic while dreaming of becoming a traffic cop or something?	Don't give me a hard time, Mr. Gordon. I'm just --
6 Doing your fucking job. I know. I watch television too.	Yes. Here's your ticket.
7 You get the hell out of my house now, asshole. And know this -- you are going to be a lucky asshole if I haven't got you fired before the day is out. I can do it with one phone call, and I'm pissed enough to do it now!

1 What was that?  You got something to say, say it! Say it!	Nothing.
2 You no-good pup!

1 It'll come out Jack lied and the kid'll get hung for it.	He was scheduled to testify for a committee investigating organized crime in New England and the construction business.
2 Who?	Twombley.
3 No shit.	You think Jack shot him?
4 Well, it was an accident.	They were out deer hunting, right? Jack probably heard the gun go off, then came back and found the body.

1 Then you accidentally see your body, or your face, or whatever, and you don't know who the hell it belongs to. Strange. It's the business with the old man, I know, and how incredibly pissed I was at him, and also chasing Jack Hewitt like that, and the Goddamned truck going through the ice, not to mention Margie's being so upset -- one thing on top of another.	Wade, are you alright?
2 But you gotta hear this. You won't believe it. Mel Gordon had come by to visit LaRiviere and so now I'm in his office.

1 Mom?	Yes dear?
2 I'm sorry I was so mean to you earlier.

1 Daddy...	Alice... I...

1 Mr. President, it's an honor. Now with your permission can we lead you the fuck out of here.	You read my mind.
2 Put your pilot on.	He's busy being dead.

1 Sir, you threw out page two.	Goddamn right I did.  I asked for a tough-as-nails speech and you gave me diplomatic bullshit.  What's the point in having a speech if I have to ad-lib?
2 It was a good ad-lib, sir.	Thanks.  Wrote it last night.

1 Air Force One, this is AF-135-RA. We have been instructed to refuel your plane.	About goddamn time.
2 Please change course to Zero Seven Four and drop to eighteen thousand feet. Over.	Air Force One, acknowledged.  tNT. EMERGENCY PARACHUTE LAUNCH RAMP.

1 Romeo Tango Zulu, do you have the President? Over.	Stand by.
2 Romeo Tango Zulu1 this is Tower.

1 Now, or he dies, please.	Come on, Alice.

1 She isn't a part of this. This is between you and me.	Call up Petrov and order Stravanavitch' S release.

1 Our KH-ll's took this one at 0100 hours. What you see here is the mobilization of two mechanized brigades.	They've gotta be joking.

1 You know what?	What?
2 I miss you. And I miss her.	But that's the point, Jim. We're right here.
3 I wish it were that easy...

1 Did they say anything about my family?	They're still alive, but the loyalists plan to start killing hostages in forty minutes.
2 Then tell me there's a rescue operation underway.

1 It's bait.  Don't take it.	Sir, the Speaker of the House attacked this administration on national television.  You can't afford to leave that hanging.
2 Did we tape the Duke game?

1 Twenty five minutes. They should be here any moment.	They better. Fuel's almost gone.

1 Did you feel that?	Yes I did...
2 Felt like a large asteroid.	Yes it did.  Mr. Dunn, can I ask you a personal question?
3 What is it, Mary?	Um...  Do you people scream right when you... you know.

1 Elaine.	Ted, please.  You're just making things difficult for yourself.

1 Elaine.	Ted.  I don't know why you got on this flight.  I don't know what you're trying to prove.
2 Elaine, we have to go back.	We can't go back.  We had something very special, but it's all over.
3 Elaine, I mean the mission has to be aborted.  This ship should never have passed FSA inspection.  This thing is held together by string and chewing gum.

1 Ted, the lever!	Kramer, the WORP control handle just came off in my hand.

1 Have you got it straightened out now?	I think so.
2 That's my girl.

1 Request; comprehensive electrical systems check.	Systems check positive.  Look, Elaine, I...
2 Request; life support systems check.	Life support check.  Elaine, it's obvious you've been ignoring me.  You're a woman. I can relate to that.
3 Request; self-analysis of ROK hardware and software systems regarding behavioral changes.	There's nothing wrong with me, Elaine. What about tonight -- just you and me.  We can be alone.  I can get rid of everyone else on the ship -- I've already proven <u>that</u>.

1 Which passenger is Joe Salucci?	Sixteen 'C', why?
2 He's carrying a bomb.	A b...

1 You're seeing bugs where they don't exist, Striker.	Look at this wiring.  It's shorting out under high temperatures.
2 You're tired, Striker, overworked.  That wiring meets all the safety specifications.	I know you've been subtly spreading the word that I'm having a breakdown.

1 Hello, I'm Paul Carey from the airline. I'm here to pick up Captain Kramer.	Oh, yes. Come in, Paul. Rex will be right out.

1 Can't you take a guess?	Well...not for another two hours.
2 You can't take a guess for another two hours?	No, I mean we can't <u>land</u> for another two hours. Fog has closed down everything this side of the mountains. We've got to go through to Chicago!

1 Elaine!	Ted!
2 I came home early and found your note. I guess you meant for me to read it later. Elaine, I've got to talk to you.	I just don't want to go over it any more.
3 I know things haven't been right for a long time, but it'll be different. If you'll just be patient, I can work things out.	I have been patient and I've tried to help, but you wouldn't even let me do that.
4 Don't you feel anything for me at all any more?	It takes so many things to make love last. Most of all it takes respect. And I can't live with a man I don't respect!

1 I wish I could say the same for George Zipp.	Be patient, Ted. No one expects you to get over this immediately.

1 See them, Elaine?	Uh-huh.

1 He's right on the heading.	All right, he's on final now! Put out all runway lights except niner.

1 Yes?	Oh, Stewardess. My husband is very sick. Can you do something, please?
2 Well, the doctor will be with you in just a moment. One thing: do you know what he had for dinner?	Yes, of course. We both had fish. Why?
3 Oh, it's nothing to be alarmed about. We'll get back to you very quickly.

1 Excuse me, sir. Would you like some coffee before we serve dinner?	No. No thank you.

1 He's not here.  Why ask me?	The young woman at the front said you might know where he is.
2 She did, did she?  Well, she was wrong.  Excuse me, I have to change.

1 Kill them both.	Here?
2 Do it!

1 What is this?	A rubber.  A condom.  You know... Coney Island whitefish?  Men, human men, put them on their, uh -- penises -- to protect against having babies.  You need this for anything?

1 Matthew, you don't have to-- .	Stay back!  I'm okay.

1 Yeah... I know the routine.	You are married?
2 Was.  Divorced.	We mate for life.  Divorce... is a strange concept to us.
3 It's like having an eleventh finger removed.  It hurts like hell, but you never really needed the damn thing in the first place.

1 Well, let's roll, George.	To the... to the beach?
2 Come on, let's go, dude.  Surf's up!

1 Uh, George...	Where is the drug?  Where have they taken it?

1 How do I look?	You look very good.

1 One of the two men was Hubley, right?  What about the other one? Did you know him?	Yeah... I seen him around.  High- roller dude named Strader.  Joshua Strader.  Runs a club on the west side.  Encounters.
2 Yeah, I heard of it.	That's all I know.  You want anything more, you ask somebody else.

1 Granger and Pitts are already on it.	Granger and Pitts have one hell of a caseload... and I would have thought with Jetson here being the first Newcomer plainclothes, and Hubley's body being found over in the Newcomer community...
2 Don't tell me what to think.

1 Movement!	Position?
2 Can't lock up...	Talk to me, Hudson.
3 Uh, seems to be in front and behind.

1 And it's too late to shut it down?	I'm afraid so.  The crash did too much damage.  The overload is inevitable, at this point.

1 You read my deposition...it's complete and accurate.	Look, I believe you, but there are going to be some heavyweights in there.  You got Feds, you got interstellar commerce commission, you got colonial administration, insurance company guys...
2 I get the picture.	Just tell them what happened.  The important thing is to stay cool and unemotional.

1 They're right under the primary heat exchangers.	Yeah?  Maybe the organisms like the heat, that's why they built...
2 That's not what I mean.  Gorman, if your men have to use their weapons in there, they'll rupture the cooling system.	She's right.

1 What's he scanning for?	PDT'S.  Personal-Data Transmitters. Every adult colonist had one surgically implanted.

1 How do you feel?	All right, I guess.  One hell of a hangover.  Look, Ripley... I...
2 Forget it.

1 Outstanding.  Then all we need's a deck of cards.  All right, let's move like we got a purpose.	Aye-firmative.

1 They're in the approach corridor.	On my way.

1 No!  No!  She's alive!  We have to --	All right!  She's alive.  I believe it.  But we gotta get moving!  Now!

1 Looks like it stung him.	Hey...hey!  Look, Crowe and Dietrich aren't dead, man.

1 Fifteen meters.	I don't know, an acid hole in a duct.  Something under the floors, not on the plans. I don't know!

1 I was the best at the game. I knew the whole maze.	The 'maze'?  You mean the air ducts?
2 Yeah, you know.  In the walls, under the floor.  I was the ace.  I could hide better than anybody.	You're really something, ace.

1 Burke!  Open the door!	Look!

1 How many colonists?	Sixty, maybe seventy families.
2 Sweet Jesus.

1 Oh - excuse me!	Is her mother still lying on the floor?
2 No, she's fine.	I'm so relieved.

1 No! No! No!	Yes! Back! Back! Listen - don't you know where you are?
2 Where?	We are in the Residence of the Fartsbishop of Salzburg.
3 Fartsbishop!

1 Look, old man, you stay out of this. We spend a fortune on you, more than we can possibly afford, and all you do is criticize, morning to night. And then you think you can -	Stanzi!
2 No, it's right he should hear. I'm sick to death of it. We can't do anything right for you, can we?

1 Excellency!	Madame. How can I help you?

1 I do apologize for this afternoon. I behaved like a silly girl. Where shall we go?	What?
2 Should we stay here? It's a charming room. I love these candlesticks. Were they here earlier? I didn't notice them I suppose I was too nervous.

1 Be careful!	Be careful!

1 What a strange young man.	Yes. He is a little strange.

1 Well, I'm glad to hear that.	Excuse me, Sire, but what do you think these could be? Being a foreigner, I would love to learn.
2 Cattivo again, Court Composer. Well, tell him, Mozart. Name us a German virtue.

1 Majesty!	Did we vote in the end for German or Italian?

1 Excuse me, but how old are you?	Twenty-six.
2 Well, my advice is to marry this charming young lady and stay with us in Vienna.

1 Well, what do you have for me today?	Your Majesty, Herr Mozart -
2 Yes, what about him?	He's here.
3 Ah-ha. Well. There it is. Good.

1 Yes, Papa, name it. Name it. I'll do anything you say!	I want you to come back with me to Salzburg, my son.

1 Oh, thank you, sir.	Do any pupils come to the house?
2 Not that I've seen.	Then how does he pay for all this? Does he work at all?
3 Oh, yes, sir, all day long. He never leaves the house until evening. He just sits there, writing and writing. He doesn't even eat.	Really? What is it he's writing?
4 Oh, I wouldn't know that, sir.	Of course not. You're a good girl. You're very kind to do this. Next time you're sure they'll be out of the house, let me know, will you?

1 Isn't he marvelous? He cost me a bundle, that horse, but he's worth it. I tell you, if you'd played Don Giovanni here it would have been a great success. I'm not joking. These people aren't fools. You could do something marvelous for them.	I'd like to try them someday. I'm not sure I'd be much good at it.
2 'Course you would. You belong here, my boy, not the snobby Court. You could do anything you felt like here - the more fantastic the better! That's what people want, you know: fantasy. You do a big production, fill it with beautiful magic tricks and you'll be absolutely free to do anything you want. Of course, you'd have to put a fire in it, because I've got the best fire machine in the city and a big flood - I can do you the finest water effects you ever saw in your life. Oh, and a few trick animals. You'd have to use those.	Animals?
3 I tell you I picked up a snake in Dresden last week - twelve foot long  - folds up to six inches, just like a paper fan. It's a miracle.

1 Herr Mozart. What a surprise. What can I do for you?	Is my pupil still anxious to learn the art of music?
2 Well, your pupil is married and living in Mannheim, young man.	Really? Perhaps your dear wife might care to profit from my instruction?
3 What is this, Mozart? What's the matter with you?	Well. Since it appears nobody is eager to hire my services, could you favour me with a little money instead?
4 What for?	If a man cannot earn, he must borrow.
5 Well, this is hardly the way to go about it.	No doubt, sir. But I am endowed with talent, and you with money. If I offer mine, you should offer yours.

1 Nine performances! Nine! That's all it's had - and withdrawn.	I know; it's outrageous. Still, if the public doesn't like one's work one has to accept the fact gracefully.
2 But what is it they don't like?	Well, I can speak for the Emperor. You made too many demands on the royal ear. The poor man can't concentrate for more than an hour and you gave him four.
3 What did you think of it yourself? Did you like it at all?	I think it's marvelous. Truly.
4 It's the best opera yet written. I know it! Why didn't they come?	I think you overestimate our dear Viennese, my friend. Do you know you didn't even give them a good bang at the end of songs so they knew when to clap?
5 I know, I know. Perhaps you should give me some lessons in that.	I wouldn't presume. All the same, if it wouldn't be imposing, I would like you to see my new piece. It would be a tremendous honour for me.
6 Oh no, the honour would be all mine.	Grazie, mio caro, Wolfgang!
7 Grazie, a lei, Signor Antonio!

1 Another? But that's too soon! Tomorrow night? It's impossible! Did he say a hundred?	Yes. Can I - could I help you, in any way?
2 Would you? Actually, you could.	My dear friend, it would be my greatest pleasure.
3 But you'd have to swear not to tell a soul. I'm not allowed.	Of course.
4 You know, it's all here in my head. It's just ready to be set down. But when I'm dizzy like this my eyes won't focus. I can't write.	Then, let us try together. I'd regard it as such an honour. Tell me, what is this work?
5 A Mass. A Mass for the Dead.

1 That's wonderful!	Yes, yes - go on. The Voca Me. Suddenly sotto voce. Write that down: sotto voce, pianissimo. Voca me cum benedictis. Call me among the blessed.

1 What are you doing, Herr Director?	Taking out what you should never have put in.

1 Well?	I regret it is not too familiar.
2 Can you recall no melody of mine? I was the most famous composer in Europe when you were still a boy. I wrote forty operas alone. What about this little thing?

1 Well, Mozart is already rehearsing.	Incredible.
2 The Emperor has given him permission.

1 That lady is back, sir.	Show her in. Then go to bed.

1 Oh dear girl, your extracurricular activities are of no consequence to me. I don't give a damn who you sleep with. I'm concerned about David.	Yes, sir.
2 It's a full moon. Where is he?	At my flat. I'm off at midnight and...

1 Aw come on, Miss Price!	Call me Alex.
2 Aw come on, Alex!	Shall I be forced to feed you, Mr. Kessler?

1 The kitchen.	Very nice.

1 Alex, I've lost my mind. I woke up at the zoo! But you know what? I feel terrific!	The zoo?
2 Waking up at the zoo, that's not so insane. Having no clothes on? That's insane. What did I do last night, Alex?	Don't you remember?
3 I said goodbye to you. I was locked out of the flat. I climbed the wall and came in through the bathroom window. I started to read and then I was naked at the zoo!  I guess I am out of my fucking mind.

1 Hello, Benjamin.	No.
2 No what?	No.
3 Well, all right then, be that way. Here, swallow this.	No.

1 Here, Gladys, Tom. Did you hear the one about the crashing plane?	No, but we're about to.

1 There were witnesses?	So they said.
2 How could there have been witnesses? It was so dark. We were running and I fell and Jack went to help me up and this thing came from nowhere... I don't understand what they're talking about.	In time I'm sure it will all come back to you.
3 Doctor, my memory is fine. It's my sanity I'm beginning to worry about.

1 Nice looking group.	Listen, at least it's warm in here.
2 Look at that.

1 Did you hear that?	I heard that.
2 What was it?

1 It sounds far away.	Not far enough. Come on.

1 What can I say, Jack?	You don't have to say anything.
2 Aren't you going to say, 'I told you so'?	If I was still alive, I probably would.
3 You look awful.	Thank you.
4 I didn't mean it. I don't know what I'm saying. I'm not even sure it was me who killed those people. I don't remember doing it.	What about the zoo?
5 Well, even if I'm not the wolfman, I am crazy enough to do something like that. I mean, here I sit in Leicester Square talking to a corpse. I'm glad to see you, Jack.	I want you to meet some people.

1 Excuse me.  Yes?	Roger Mathison, Doctor.
2 What here?	He's on the telephone.
3 Tell him I'm out. No, tell him I've passed away. An old war wound or something. Tell him I'm dead. And no more calls!

1 Hello, Tom.	You here again? What do you want?

1 Where you been?	Where do you think I've been?  I took the baby for a stroll in the park.

1 Character, hmmpf! That's your idea?	Not at all. That's Alexander Hamilton's idea[5] - the finest banking mind this country has ever known. Those are his exact words, gentlemen. Character!  It's the only thing you can bank on, and it's the only thing that will pull this country out of the doldrums.

1 That is simple, isn't it? I assume you can prove that if necessary.	Oh yes, of course. There was someone with me. A lady.
2 Looks like you're going to have no trouble at all. What was the lady's name, Mr. Cluett?	If you don't mind, Inspector, I'd rather not say - that is, unless it becomes absolutely essential. You see, she's married.
3 Oh!	You understand?
4 Why, of course.

1 Then what did you want to gamble for? If you'd have beat us out of fifty G's, you'd have been paid, wouldn't you? Well, we want our dough.	I'm sorry, Dude, butI
2 That don't do us any good.	But after all, you can't take blood from a stone.
3 We can take blood from anything   If it's comin' to us.

1 But I'm giving a party for him - a real, old-fashioned surprise party. Caps, bells, whistles, and everything. I'm really terribly excited about it. I've been planning it for months.	Well
2 Well, what?	Well, aren't you going to invite me?
3 You? No can do. It's all set. Just a few of Tom's closest friends.	Now Phyllis, if you don't invite me, I'm coming anyway.
4 Don't be silly, Cyril. These are respectable people. They'd probably bore you to death.	No, they won't. Not when you are there. Oh, please, be a sport. Please ask me.
5 Why are you so anxious?	Don't you know?
6 No.	I want to be near you!

1 I'm not interested in what you think.	You've no right to do this to her, Mr. Cluett. Why don't you think it over? It's only gonna get you into a lot of trouble.
2 I tell you, I'm not interested in your opinion.	No?  Then maybe you'll understand, Mrs. Dickson. Oh, gee, he's crazy about you. Nobody knows it better than you. If he ever finds out, it'll kill him.

1 Ho! Ho! Ho!	Ho, ho, ho, yourself! I wouldn't laugh if I were you. You may not suspect it, but I'm still attractive - to some.
2 Listen, don't go around being attractive to anyone but me . . .	Well . . .
3 Don't you forget that I'm still the head man around here too. Now we'll get the tickets changed for tomorrow night. You and I are going out together. How's that?	Tomorrow night?

1 Oh!	Oh, no! It's not for you. You're only going to get married. Mrs. Dickson and I are going to go on the honeymoon.

1 It's all right. Thanks.	And what's more, keep up the good work and who knows - some day you'll be the fellow sitting behind that desk . . .  Not a bad thought, eh?

1 What time did this thing happen?	The clock opposite the vault was stopped by a bullet at 12:09.
2 All right. If the boy proves an alibi, he's all right, isn't he?	If he can do it, yes.
3 Why, certainly he can.  Matt, now all you've got to do is tell them where you were last night, between twelve and twelve-thirty, and everything will be all right.

1 They've been coming in steady all morning. I have called for some extra police.	All right. Send down to the vaults and have our reserve cash sent up here right away.
2 We haven't much on hand, you know. If it gets any worse, I hope we don't have to close the doors.

1 Hello, Helen!	Matt, come here!
2 Why?	Come here, honey!

1 Shh . . . !  I'll wait for you upstairs.	All right, dear.

1 Yes, I guess it was one, 'cause...	It couldn't have been earlier?
2 No. It wasn't earlier because...	Yes, I know. Cause the Dooley sisters weren't in yet.
3 No - because me clock struck four, and when it strikes four, it's one.	There you are!

1 Certainly, Mr. Jones! Certainly! Charlie!	They're starting to come in already. Yeah. Yeah. Well, listen. Don't waste any time. Get all the money you can lay your hands on, and bring it down here right away. Step on it.

1 Our place, Clell Miller's, Sammy Johnston, the Creeders. Will Hite.	The sheriff says it was a gang of drunk Kansas boys.
2 I say we ride into town and kill us some Pinkertons and railroad men.

1 Things changed when you quit the gang. For example, I'm now the one who says "Let's ride."	He's not bad at it.
2 It's tougher than it looks.

1 You have no shame.	Not yet. But I'm hoping.

1 You shut up now, boy.	No, really. You're wife said she needed some help, seeing as you were so fat you couldn't find your --

1 Because we were good at it?  Hell, we were great at it. Jesse, don't tell anyone I said this, because everybody knows I'm the toughest man in this town, but you are one terrifying sonofabitch with those guns.	Yeah.

1 It'll be the biggest score yet.	What will be?

1 Missed you, cousin.	Missed you too, cousin.

1 I have no idea what you just said, but it sounded real nice.	Shakespeare.  He's European.
2 Ah.

1 I know it ain't no durned bank holiday!	You're right, sir.
2 Then why can't I go in there?	On account of we're robbing it.
3 Oh. Why didn't you just say so?	It's a secret.
4 Fine. I'll just wait here.	I'd appreciate that.

1 They're gone. What are you --	I fooled them into thinking I was alone.
2 Well, I hope the boy pulls through. We should know in the morning.	I think he's already feeling better.

1 That just might work.	Maybe, maybe...

1 How'd it go in there?	Fine. How'd it go out here?
2 We're gonna have to talk...

1 Shoulda learned with Web. Made it look fun, made it look like an adventure. Got Web killed. Now Jim.	Jim was old enough...
2 He was a boy riding with the most famous outlaws in the West. How was he supposed to say no to that?	Railroad burned him out too. You couldn't have stopped him.
3 You're a piss-poor liar for the smartest man I know.	Yeah.
4 A war against the railroad. What the hell were we thinking?	I'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time.

1 Riders --	We know, Ma. Now we got to get you to Doc Mimms.
2 Take care of each other, boys. You say your prayers.

1 You and I, we've started... something, you know?  I don't know what'll happen if you do this.	Me neither.
2 Let the law --	Laws don't touch men like Thaddeus Rains. Only justice does.
3 Whose justice? Yours or God's?  When will you stop?	When my name makes them cry in their sleep. When I've brought them to ashes.

1 Did you order our houses burned down?	Not that day. I am guilty of many things, but that was Mr. Thaddeus Rains and Parker, that day.

1 And you're too young.	I'm the same age you were when you went off to war.
2 And the same age Web was. No.

1 Well, this land is about to be condemned.	I'm doing you folks a favor --

1 The final route for the railroad is complete.	I look forward to seeing it.

1 First of all: you, shut up.  Now, you've given me a thousand miles of railroad to cover. Every time the James Gang strikes, we shift a hundred detectives to that area. But there's just too much open land, too many riverbeds to ride, caves to hide in. This gang operates across four states, often riding a hundred miles between jobs.	I can't believe this.
2 And there are some towns in Missouri where James and his men can walk openly, as heroes.

1 No, you idiot. I said "Is it a receptacle tip?" Not, is Luis a despicable twit. Is it a receptacle tip? Get off me.	Is it a what?
2 Pull out.	I'm ignoring you.
3 Pull out, goddamnit!	What do you want, Courtney?

1 Do you want to come to my apartment or not?	I'm not supposed to.  But I can make an exception.
2 Do you take American Express?

1 I want a firm commitment.	I think, Evelyn, that we've...lost touch.

1 But Laurie Kennedy is a total hardbody. What do you think, Bateman?	I know her. I knew her.

1 Jesus, Davis. Yes. That was hilarious. That was you, wasn't it?	Yes, naturally.
2 Bateman killing Owen and the escort girls? Oh that s fabulous. That's rich...

1 What...is...it?	Where are you going?
2 I've gotta...I've gotta...return some videotapes.	Patrick?
3 What? CARRUTHERS  I'll call you.

1 Raised lettering, pale nimbus white...	Impressive. Very nice. Let's see Paul Owen's card.

1 Oh? And what should I say?	Just...say...no.
2 Just say no?

1 That is...if you're not doing anything.	Oh no. I have no plans.
2 Well, isn't this a coincidence.

1 I'm looking for...I guess you could say I just want to have a meaningful relationship with someone special.	Hmmmm.

1 Well.	Isn't it ridiculous? Coming all the way up here, but you know. They really are the best.
2 Then why can't they get these stains out? I mean can you talk to these people or something? I'm not getting anywhere.

1 Did you know that Whitney Houston's debut LP called simply Whitney Houston had four number-one singles on it? Did you know that, Christie? Whitney's voice leaps across so many boundaries and is so versatile-though she's mainly a jazz singer-that it's hard to take in the album on a first listening.	You actually listen to Whitney Houston? You actually have a Whitney Houston CD? More than one?

1 What can you tell me about Paul Owen?	Well...

1 How's the investigation going? Taken anyone in for "formal questioning?" 	0h no. Informal conversations, mostly. What's that, Stoli?
2 Yeah. No Finlandia, as usual. Fucking dump.	Too true. You know, Bateman-people tend to reveal so much more about themselves when they're in a relaxed setting, don't you think?

1 Oh, right. Of course...We had wanted Paul Owen to come. But he said he had plans...I guess I had dinner with Victoria...the following night.	Personally I think the guy went a little nutso. Split town for a while. Maybe he did go to London. Sightseeing. Drinking. Whatever. Anyway, I'm pretty sure he'll turn up sooner or later.  I mean, to think that one of his friends killed him, for no reason whatsoever would be too ridiculous. Isn't that right, Patrick?

1 You like Huey Lewis and the News?	They're okay. BATEMAN Their early work was a little too New Wave for my taste. But then Sports came out in 1983, I think they really came into their own, commercially and artistically.

1 A lot of what Larry says is true. They just clone stuff, or reverse engineer it, and everybody gets stuck with their inferior version cause they --	Then you've gotta ask him about that.

1 I mean, if one little comment from Gary is gonna upset you this much --	You're right. It's -- a working relationship. Don't know what I was expecting.

1 Look at this.	What?
2 Why doesn't he ask us to his party. He's never even met you.	He has thousands of employees, Milo --
3 It's for the Museum. He knows you're a painter. If anybody should be invited --	Milo --
4 I know you think I'm too attached to him, but still. I am close to Gary. And you're the most meaningful person in my life.  I'm going back to the Comix place, why should I be killing myself.	Milo, you --

1 Don't worry, Milo. I'm here as a friend. Or maybe a supplicant.	Right... What's that mean again?
2 Beggar. We're at a disadvantage with Outpost. Our experts aren't as smart as theirs. Sometimes we can't tell which technologies pose the threat of a monopoly. We need a really smart guy to help us pick our fights. I'm taking a shot in the dark, here. I can offer you 32,000 a year, a Buick. I'm hoping you've got a feeling it's the right thing to do.	It's just -- I kind of feel the need to do something with my ability. Create something...
3 Like I said: shot in the dark.

1 You're interfaced with our dish.	Gimme the coordinates?

1 Cool!	Would you like a Coke or something?
2 Oh. No thanks.

1 You did this -- overnight?	You're making me young again.

1 Why did you move around so much? When you were a kid.	...My dad was a compulsive gambler. Only he didn't think he was. That applied to guys who didn't have a "system." "Losers," who played games of chance. He could "read" people, so chance had nothing to do with it. No matter how deep a hole he dug himself, he'd give you the whole speech. And you'd better not point out the obvious.  His creditors would catch up to him. Loan sharks or whatever. He'd wake us in the middle of the night. Off we'd go, again.
2 What would you tell the kids? At your new school? You had to come up with a good story, right?

1 Hasn't affected his work, though.	Nothing does. Still. I want him to like me.

1 Every entry was authorized.	Keep looking.
2 What're we looking for?	Any irregularity in the pattern.

1 Did you wanna be alone?	No. Please.

1 Do we post it on the Net?	There're so many disinformation sites about Gary already. Where he has devil's horns or they crop him in with Saddam Hussein.

1 I felt guilty. 'Cause I "owed so much" to Alice. But even then I was starting to wonder. Is it so great to be so consumed by this one thing that you let another person do your thinking for you? If you have a lucrative skill, it's all anybody wants from you. You grow older but you don't grow up. You turn into -- into --	Gary.

1 Wanted to say goodbye to him...	Hey, we got seed money for the startup! A million-five!

1 Did you download Corey? In San Jose?	Damn. 'Have to go back over there.  Be so much easier if we could walk in the front door.
2 You don't look anything like a three- year-old.

1 'Pardon me for being rude, It was not me, it was my food.  It just popped up to say hello, and now it's gone back down below.'	That's very clever. Do you know any other poems?
2 'Milk, milk, lemonade.  Round the corner fudge is made.  Stick your finger in the hole, And out comes a tootsie roll!'	Thank you, that's beautiful. To your health.
3 To my health.	Kiss me.

1 Hello Austin. Hello Vanessa. This is Basil Exposition, from British Intelligence.  There's a company in Las Vegas called Virtucon that we think may be linked to Dr. Evil. Many of the Virtucon executives gamble at the hotel/casino where you'll be staying. That's the first place you should look.  Well, I'm off to the chat rooms.	Thank you, Exposition.
2 Oh, and Austin...	Yes?
3 Be careful.

1 But, wait, I-- you got me again. Oh, and Austin--	Yes Basil?
2 Be careful!

1 Pretty groovy Jumbo Jet, eh? How does a hot chick like you end up working at the Ministry of Defense?	I went to Oxford and excelled in several subjects, but I ended up specializing in foreign languages. I wanted to travel -- see the world. In my last year I was accepted into the M.O.D. in the Cultural Studies sector. I thought I was off on an exciting career, but my job was to read everything printed in every country. It's very boring. My whole day is spent reading wedding announcements in Farsi. If I do well with this case, I finally get promoted to field operative...
2 That's fascinating, Vanessa. Listen, why don't we go into the back and shag?	I beg your pardon?
3 I've been frozen for thirty years, man, I want to see if my bits and pieces are still working.	Excuse me?
4 My wedding tackle.	I'm sorry?
5 My meat and two veg.	Mr. Powers, please. I know that you must be a little confused, but we have a very serious situation at hand. I would appreciate it if you'd concentrate on our mission and give your libido a rest.
6 Have you ever made love to a Chigro?	A Chigro?
7 You know, a Chigro... part Chinese, part Negro...  Chigro.	We don't use the term 'Negro' anymore. It's considered offensive.
8 That's right. You're supposed to say 'colored' now, right?  Here's the stewardesses! Bring on the sexy stews!

1 A limousine has just pulled up.	Let me see.

1 Really, Austin!	Look at her hands, baby! Those are carpenter's hands.

1 What do we do now?	We've got a freaked out square and world annihilation is his bag.  You go get help. I'm gonna stay here and keep an eye on the bad Doctor.
2 I'm not going anywhere. We're a team.	Too right, youth. That's why I need you to lead the troops.
3 I'll hurry back.	Listen, Vanessa, whatever happens, I just want you to know that I feel bad about shagging that Italian girl. I had a sip of sake and all of the sudden, I don't know what happened. The whole time I was shagging her-- I mean really shagging her, I mean it was crazy, I was like a huge mechanical piston, in and out, IN and OUT!--
4 Austin, what's your point?	Anyways, what I'm trying to say is that if you want me to be a one-woman man, well, that's just groovy, because... I love you.
5 Oh, behave!

1 No, no, I want you to have it, even if it's my last piece.	No, no, I want you to have it, even if it's my last piece.
2 I'm going to go across the street and get you some sherbert.

1 Ow! You shot me!	Right. Okay. Moving on.
2 You shot me right in the arm!  Why did--

1 Hi.	Hello, Scott. I'm your father, Dr. Evil.  I have a son! I have a son! Everyone, I have a son!  Someday, Scott, this will all be yours.
2 I haven't seen you my whole life and now you show up and want a relationship? I hate you!

1 Umm, that also has already happened.	Right.  Oh, hell, let's just do what we always do. Let's hijack some nuclear weapons and hold the world hostage.  Gentlemen, it's come to my attention that a breakaway Russian Republic called Kreplachistan will be transferring a nuclear warhead to the United Nations in a few days. Here's the plan. We get the warhead, and we hold the world ransom...  ...FOR ONE MILLION DOLLARS!

1 We don't label people here, Scott.	No, he's really evil.
2 Scott.

1 I've come to apply for membership in Brolly --	You don't get rain like you used to in England. A good shower that's the ticket. Stiffens resolve, puckers the spirit, quells the namby-pamby in a man.

1 Congratulations, Mrs. Peel. You have been a worthy opponent. You have tracked us down. You are within an ace of winning.	This isn't a game.
2 Quite right, but we still make the rules.	Rules are made to be broken.
3 People, too.	Then who wins?
4 You and I. Together. But first you must confront your greatest enemy. Who could that be, Mrs. Peel? The answer is obvious ...

1 Peter Peel was a first class agent. A senior operative. 'X' department Special operations. He was engaged in top secret research. Top priority.  Government approved.	The Institute ... the funding ...
2 A cover ... for us.  I'm sorry...

1 That's better. I say, isn't this where you came in? It's impenetrable, by the way ...	You're mad.
2 Entirely. On the other hand  Mad people get things done. Let me show you --

1 Steed, we really must be --	Ahh. Perfect fit. The luxury of a hand-made shoe. As unique as a face or a fingerprint. Or should I say DNA?

1 Mother and Dr. Darling have me under observation. They think I tried to kill you.	Why should they think that?
2 You told them. You said I arrived on a camel, shot you four times. Left you for dead.	Frankly that's how I remember it.
3 But that's absurd. I may not be over-fond of you, Steed, but it's not my style.	Perhaps your memory plays tricks, Mrs. Peel.
4 That's possible. Sir August was convinced he'd met me before. But I'd never met him. Another odd thing. When it rained, he said it was just as someone had promised.	Did he say who?
5 No. But he must know. Incidentally, my double left you with this.

1 Is that what you think?	Oh, well ...  Just my type, Mrs. Peel.

1 Mmm ... what are you doing?	Keeping a stiff upper lip?
2 Is that all?

1 What's that you're wearing?	It's called Black Leather.
2 Intoxicating. Here, have one of these.

1 Ah ... sun tan lotion. Any shops nearby?	Must be. Trubshaw's busy. I'll send Mother ...

1 Under the circumstances Mother didn't see fit, but I think I can get you in ...	Well, I can't possibly go like this.

1 Your research into climate engineering was state-of-the-art. Your experiments could have revolutionized our knowledge of global warming -- had they succeeded. We need your expertise.	Perhaps I'd better start calling you doctor again, Mrs. Peel --

1 Cocky little bastard. I hope he was a baddy.	I feel sure of it.
2 I'm Alice. Mother said you'd be on your way. Mrs. Peel with you?	She was ...

1 I think she really likes you ... Where's Mrs. Peel?	Ugh ...

1 I'm glad you guys came by... What's the occasion?	Rick's got an important announcement to make.
2 Yeah. What is it?

1 All right!	When do the girls get to the party?

1 Low mileage... Handles like a dream.	So does Debbie.

1 So, he's playing hard ball. Well, two can play that game.  Go after him. Stop at nothing. You hear me?	What? I'm sorry, sir, I can't hear you.

1 That feels so great.	Good...
2 Um... that's very relaxing.	Now, I want you to lie down and drift off to slumberland.

1 See? And these are not just ordinary party-goers -- there are professionals in this crowd -- I didn't want any of them. You... You're what I want. Understand?	Yes...
2 Great. Now, what do you want to do about it?	Let's get naked.
3 You're on.

1 Ed, we're so glad you could come over at the last minute and judge our little beauty pageant.	My pleasure, Al... Always happy to help out in a pinch...  Excuse me. I better call my service... tell them where I am.

1 Screw you... Screw that... Don't jerk me around. You promised me 1500 seats for the Police Concert... 1500, not fifteen!... Screw that... Screw you -- Screw Sting.  Hi, guys.	Gary, you're quite an animal.
2 Screw you...

1 So, Larry, how have you been?	Just in love with everybody. It's really a beautiful planet. I love you, Rick. I love you guys. I love everybody.

1 It's my fault. He's dead because... I left those drugs...	It's really not all your fault. I was talking to Mike earlier and he had a lot of problems. Personal things, you know. Made some bad investments. At least now he's peaceful...

1 Ebbie. Ger... umph... lable...	Of course, sir. That explains it. Leather is a very good source of vitamin E.

1 We'll spend an hour with "Nymphos Without Pants"...	Olivier's in that, right?
2 Then it's on to the real thing.

1 He look familiar?	Very.
2 C'mon. Get the hookers in a circle. We better put Cochise out of business.

1 Nah, that's okay. My brother has to look up old people's asses all day long. Let's give him a break.	Right. Give me the will to live. Let me go first.

1 Goddamn it, Stephen, lay off!  You stupid dumbshit, you never know when to fucking quit, do you? You ever wonder why your career's in the fucking toilet? Why you're gonna be stuck a Lt. for life?	No.  I need a drink.

1 Did you do it for Tim?	That was an accident! Jesus Christ, why did you have to go in there so fucking early? Why didn't you listen to me!

1 Why'd you come here, Brian?	I wanted to know why you messed with my station assignment. I mean, is this really gonna have to one of those big brother -- little brother "you broke my GI Joe and I'm still pissed" games?
2 What is it with you, man, huh? How do you manage to keep coming up with new and amazing ways to screw up? That scotch bullshit? Am I really supposed to believe you came crawling back home because you suddenly felt heart strings moan for the family biz? You were bankrupt, man.	Hey! You don't know me --
3 I know you cold, Brian. The scary thing is, you probably could have faked it for awhile. But you see, in this job there's no place to hide. Isn't like selling log cabins. You have a bad day here -- someone dies. And that's not fucking good enough. Want another beer?	So that's it? Big bad brother's gonna ride my ass till I cough blood?
4 Big bad brother is going to treat you like any other probie -- that I don't think is going to make it.

1 Look, Brian, a photographer. Maybe I can get on the cover of LIFE magazine, too.	C'mon, let's crawl home.

1 It's okay, Stephen, I --	-- I tried, y'know? Helen's right. I don't have all the answers, but goddamn it, I've got some.  Look, you're gonna do what you have to, and maybe I shouldn't have gotten in the way. I'm your brother, not your father. Go on. You gotta go somewhere? Go...

1 With grenadine, right?	When I was twenty.
2 Oooh, very sophisticated. Having fun?

1 Thanks for the invite.	Got anything to drink in there?
2 Oh, there might be something stashed away for emergencies.

1 Okay, here's the deal. I'll tell you a story, you tell me one. Fair?	Who's doing this?
2 Your first question should be who isn't. It isn't a spark, Brian. Not enough damage. And an insurance pro? Where's the profit margin?	Then who --
3 -- No no, your turn. Tell me a story.	I don't have a story.
4 Sure you do.

1 Glass found in ignition room is in small, thin pieces, indicating explosion. Lack of discoloration indicates a long, slow burn. Explosion must of come after a slow burn.  You little tease... What were you up to you little bastard, huh? What made you that mad?  Or scared.  It started in this room. Took its time, hung out... but the air ran out. It couldn't breathe. So it was snuffed. But it wasn't dead... still all that trapped heat, lying low, waiting for some sucker to open the door and give it that one gulp of air...	-- Another backdraft.

1 So Seagrave and Holcomb were accountants...	And Cosgrove. Coppers figured he laundered money for the mob before getting into real estate. They weren't very high on Seagrave, either.
2 Nice bunch of guys.	Who all ended up wearing candles for faces...  Swayzak's up to his ass in this somehow. Guy can barely hold a drink in his hand, he's so scared.

1 Well that's two things to strangle Stephen for. Where is he, anyway?	Stephen's not staying here now, Brian. He moved out last April.

1 What?	"Probationary Fireman Brian McCaffrey, on his very first fire, showed the kind of bravery and courage of a veteran firefighter when he risked life and limb to double-check a burning floor alone, emerging victoriously with Anna Rodriguez, a seamstress for the North Shore Clothing Company... McCaffrey first gained prominence as the subject of a 1972 Pulitzer Prize winning photograph taken at the scene of his father's death..."

1 We gotta roll, Stevie...	I'll be there.
2 They're waitin' man.	I'll be there, goddamn it!

1 Anyway, down here, take a look...	McCaffrey, hold this for us.

1 Alderman Swayzak.	Investigator Rimgale.
2 I need to get in the trunk.

1 It's horrible. They burned her breasts with cigarettes. Christ.	Yeah? At least she's alive! I see people get killed every day! Worse yet, tortured first and then killed! The nuns got off easy. Jeez. Cigarette burns. Everyone's all upset about fucking cigarette burns. I'll show you cigarette burns!

1 How come all those guys who're looking to get 50 from the Church haven't come up with shit? You got some kinda inside track?	I'm a Catholic.

1 Oh God, my God. it's goddamn good to be good. Forgive me. Father, for I have sinned. It's still goddamn good to be good.	I forgive you.

1 You do know that he's gonna blow up your house, kill your wife and kids --	Good. I'll give him an extra 10 grand for his trouble. I hate that motherfucking house and --
2 He's gonna kill you, man. Do you hear me, motherfucker? You. Dead. Get it?	I've been dodging bullets since I was fourteen. No one can kill me. I'm fucking blessed. I'm fucking Catholic.

1 ...Benedict Arnold...	...that simpleton is holding back the race.  They got rid of us and keep those two buffoons, Mantan and Sleep 'N Eat, y'knowwhatI'msayin'?

1 My group we need some exposure. Was wondering if you could hook a brother up?	Hook you up?  The Mau-Mau's?  You must be smoking.  Why in the world would I want to hook up a bunch of red, black and green flag-waving pseudo revolutionairies?
2 So now I see where you're coming from.  Just because we ain't rapping about Gucci, Timberland, Rolex, Benz, Cristal, ho's and bitches, we're pseudo.	Who are you revolting against?
3 We're revolting against the powers that be, that been enslaving the minds and hearts of all people of color.  And we won't stop rapping till we bring about the overthrow of the government of the U.S. of A.	Please.
4 If you were really down you would get us together with that boss of yours.  What's his name again?	Delacroix.
5 Yeah, him.	What makes you think he would write a show about the Mau-Mau's.
6 C'mon, why not?  The Monkees had a show.  Look at all that other junk that's on TV.  We got underground cult following.

1 DeLa - what's the matter with you.	You ain't happy about the green light?

1 Nice to meet you.	And this is Manray.

1 How different?	Trust me.  Of course I still have to pitch it to my boss, but we'll have an answer one way or the other.
2 DeLa, I'm aboard.  As long as I get to hoof and get paid too!!!	That's right.  Money turns the wheel.

1 I understand Black culture.  I grew up around black people all my life. If the truth be told I probably know "niggers" better than you, Monsieur Delacroix.  Please don't get offended by my use of the quote-unquote N word.  I got a black wife and three bi-racial children, so I feel I have a right to use that word.  I don't give a damn what Spike says, Tarantino is right.  Nigger is just a word.  If Dirty Ole Bastard can use it every other word so can I.	I would prefer you not use that word in my presence.
2 NIGGER.  NIGGER.  NIGGER.  NIGGER.

1 Every week we follow the trials and tribulations of two real coons - Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat.  The Dusky Duo.	What are there character traits?
2 Ignorant, dullwitted, lazy, and unlucky.	Exactly!
3 Mantan is an uneducated Negro who always by some stroke of unbelievable stupidity makes his best laid plans go haywire.	And Sleep 'n Eat is his comical sidekick?
4 Yep, you guessed it.	This could be bigger than "Amos and Andy."

1 I will not be held responsible for these revisions.  These changes are not the way I want to go.  This is an outrage.  This is a sham.  A violation!	Calm down, please.

1 Enough about me, what's happening with you?	The same old, same old.  Trying to get my stuff through.

1 How did you know?	It hit me like a ton of bricks.
2 How can this be?  You and me at the same time, the exact same thought. It's scary.	The idea was out there in the universe.  Now what?

1 You've said that already.	I'm gonna slit my wrists.  Cut my throat.  For the love of Joseph.

1 Why'd you do that?	I don't want to hear it.
2 How long have you and Hambone been hangin' out?	You're the one that put us together. We're friends.
3 That crazy brother of yours doesn't think so.	He's just playing big brother.
4 Oh, is he?  You getting jiggy with Mantan?	Please don't go there.
5 Dunwitty and I feel you've been getting too close to him, getting his mind all messed up.	I can't lie to him.  If he asks me something, I tell him what I think.
6 Do you have to be so damn forthright?

1 That's the way it came out.  Let me ask you one question.  Have you ever been in want, in need your entire privileged life?	Now I'm privileged?!  Why?  Because I didn't grow up on food stamps and welfare?  Because I didn't call home a cardboard box?  No, I never ever went to bed hungry and I'm proud of it, too.  Whoever told you that living in poverty earns you somekind of badge of honor flat out lied to you.
2 The point I'm trying to make is that this is a blessing.  It's going to be fun doing this show and we should all look at it that way.

1 It was.  It is.  But this is a different kind of show.	If at first it's not what you want, just work that much harder, Peerless.
2 Mommy, please don't call me that.	Son, Peerless is your name.  Now you might be one of these Hollywood types, change your name and all that but Peerless Dothan is on your birth certificate.
3 I know what's on my birth certificate.  You heard from Daddy?	I guess he's still on the road. What kind of show is this?  Are they some Negroes in it without being buffoons?
4 To answer your question, there are a lot of Negroes in it and what is your definition of buffoons?	Peerless, I didn't raise a buffoon. We have enough of those on television already.
5 Please let me know when you hear from Daddy, get a number or something.	I will.  And good luck with your show.  I hope it's a huge success. You've worked very hard.  You deserve it.

1 I know all of you have seen the overnight ratings.  Through the roof.  But in this game you gotta be one, two, three steps ahead.  I introduce you to Myrna Goldfarb. She's the best media consultant in the biz.	First, I would like to say I love the show.  It's very courageous. My parents marched in Selma, Alabama with Dr. King.

1 We both left the hustle and bustle of Uptown, Harlem...	...the big apple, New York, New York.
2 To come back to our roots.	Our Alabamy Home.  Now we're getting countrified.  We is Bama's.
3 No mo' "city slickers."  Ahh, can't you smell the sweet aroma of the ripe watermelons and high cotton?	Tell 'em what you mean Mistuh Mantan.
4 Well, thank you Mistuh Sleep 'N Eat.	Give or cousins some of dem educated feets.

1 People show their happiness in a lot of different ways.	Well, homeboy, looks like he's at a funeral.

1 Good day to you, young sir.	Good morning.
2 Where are you bound for?	That is none of your business.
3 Is your mother not afraid on account of the highwayman to let one so young as you travel?	Not at all, sir.  I have a pair of good pistols that have already done execution, and are ready to do it again.

1 Good morning, Private James.  Please come in.  I should like you to meet my uncle, Herr Minister of Police Galgenstein.	How do you do, sir?

1 That's a very handsome sword you have there.	It was with this sword that my late father, Harry James, God rest his soul, met Sir Huddelstone Fuddelstone, the Hampshire baronet, and was fatally run through the neck.  He was quite in the wrong, having insulted Lady Fuddelstone, when in liquor, at the Brentford Assembly.  But, like a gentleman, he scorned to apologize.
2 And now you risk the same fate.  If you are killed, your mother is all alone in the world.	I am Harry James' son, and will act as becomes my name and quality.

1 I have no luggage.	The gentleman has nothing contraband.

1 No.	Have you had one?
2 Never.	But, for a time... a passing fancy?
3 Not even that.	How can I believe that there is not a man who has inspired desires in you?
4 Not one.	Have you not a man whom you value?
5 That man has, perhaps, not yet been born.	What!  You have not met a man worthy of your attention?
6 Many worthy of attention; but valuing is something more.  I could value only someone whom I loved.	Then you have never loved?  Your heart is empty.
7 Your word "empty" makes me laugh. Is it fortunate, or unfortunate?  If it is fortunate, I congratulate myself.  If it is unfortunate, I do not care, for I am not aware of it.	It is nonetheless a misfortune, and you will know it when you love.
8 But if, when I love, I am unhappy, I will know that my empty heart was my good fortune.	That is true, but it seems to me impossible that you should be unhappy in love.
9 It is only too possible.  Love requires a mutual harmony which is difficult, and it is even more difficult to make it last.	I agree; but God put us on earth to take that risk.
10 A man may need to do that, and find it amusing; but a girl is bound by other laws.	I believe you, and I see I must hasten to leave, for otherwise I shall become the unhappiest of men.
11 How so?	By loving you, with no hope of possessing you.

1 I feel the ribbon.	Then you must get it.

1 Was he cheated?	In so far as I can tell these things -- no.  I believe the Chevalier won the money fairly.
2 Hmm-mmmm.

1 Did you buy the horse, papa?	Now, just have a little patience, my boy.  Your birthday isn't until next week.
2 But I will have it on my birthday, won't I?	Well, we'll just have to wait and see, won't we?

1 Don't like 'em, don't eat 'em, don't make no damn difference to me.	You know that was like a quadruple negative?

1 He is the only one unaccounted for.	Maybe he's dead too. Maybe you killed them both, Mueller --

1 Holy fuck... Holy fuck, what the fuck did you guys do?	We found him like this...

1 You smoke, Ray?	This is one of those interrogation tricks, isn't it? You don't give me a cigarette till I tell you more.
2 No, actually, I just left mine in the car and was hoping you had some.

1 Not true, Cadet, I've got a gun --	Jesus!

1 Back up.	Mueller was alone in the cabin?
2 Yeah.

1 Shut up.  Let me see your grenades.	Why?
2 We were each given three so whoever killed West will be missing one.

1 You gotta untie me.  I didn't do this thing, Ray.	You hated West more than any of us.
2 Maybe, but that don't make me a killer --	You're the only one missing a grenade.
3 Which anyone coulda taken out of my gear on the chopper. Were you watching your pack on the ride in?

1 You... I've seen you around the Base. But you...  You're not Army, are you?	Coast Guard, special detective detail. We feel this incident may have put the beaches of Florida at risk.

1 You tried to pin three stone murders on Dunbar --	How many murders did you cover up? One? Five? Maybe an even ten.
2 Can I go to jail for punching a guy who's been shot?

1 Or you, Levi? When is it finally going to come out that you were the one who killed him?	I didn't --
2 But you can't prove it! You can't prove anything until we find the bodies!

1 He's not done by a longshot, I can get more out of him --	He can wait. Kendall's out of surgery.

1 I'm sorry, Bill.	Don't be. I'm not cut out to deal with the West's of the world.
2 You're a good soldier, Bill.	I thought you said that wasn't a compliment.

1 Thank you. At some point in there I'm gonna rub my nose. When I do, go at him with everything you got.	Good cop/bad cop?
2 Something like that.

1 Something wrong?	Being back here. Gives me the willies.
2 Not the happiest of memories?

1 West was a monster! Fifteen years ago, I was here, I was Section Eight, I was Pike. Fuck being the knife dummy -- that thing he did, stripping Pike down, making him stand outside all night? He did that every year, he did that to me. Fifteen years ago, I wanted him dead, and now I'm supposed to care that somebody offed him? Sorry, no can do. I tried.	You did more than try. You cracked Dunbar in less than three minutes, as an investigator you're phenomenal --
2 Phenomenal at taking bribes, right?

1 You wanted to break him.	Yeah.
2 So did I.

1 What?	Seven guys. What was it you said? You were "just starting to believe I wasn't the guy people said".

1 How?	Mueller. He's as bad as West and we both know it. Now I can't do it, cause I'm tied up, but we get the others to go along --
2 I don't think I want to hear this --	Someone else can do the deed, it doesn't have to be you. Maybe Nunez too, he's got a tendency to follow Mueller, but the rest of us can come out ahead -- the guys who took out their Sergeant's killers! We'll move the bodies out to the creek and say we came over the hill right as they fragged West, all we gotta do is tell the story right.

1 Nunez was chasing Dunbar.	Because he'd shot Mueller.
2 But you didn't see it, right?	Like I said, I was in the kitchen. When I came out, Mueller and Pike were dead, Nunez and Childs were hit and Dunbar was gone.

1 Who, Levi --	Childs.

1 Cadet Michael Mueller, I hereby place you under military arrest for the murder of Sergeant Nathan West --	The fuck are you talking about --
2 You are to be stripped of all weapons and placed under guard --	Bullshit --
3 Until we return to base, and ballistics can match your weapon to the slugs in Sergeant West's body --	Shut up!

1 You both know if you do this, if you go after a Senator's son and you're wrong... it's not just me in the hot seat anymore.	We know.
2 I'm giving you a chance to walk away.

1 I don't have a job, but I would have a job if you gave me one. And I may not have much, but I have more determination than any man you're ever going to meet.	Sorry, kid. I don't do charity.
2 I'll work night and day, and you won't have to pay me. You just have to tell me who she is.

1 You won't find a better place!	I don't expect to.

1 Yeah.	It's not a woman, it's a fish. No one ever catches her.

1 It's okay, just leave it.	I can get it. I can just...

1 I thought you said you didn't have a church wedding.	Well, we were all set to, but there was a complication.

1 What, a father's not allowed to talk about his son?	I am a footnote in that story. I am the context for your great adventure. Which never happened! Incidentally! You were selling novelty products in Wichita the day I was born.
2 Jesus Christ.	Friend of yours? Did you help him out of a bind?
3 Come on, Will. Everyone likes that story.	No Dad, they don't. I do not like the story. Not anymore, not after a thousand times. I know all the punchlines, Dad. I can tell them as well as you can.  For one night, one night in your entire life, the universe does not revolve around Edward Bloom. It revolves around me and my wife. How can you not understand that?

1 Josephine actually went to the Congo last year.	Oh, so you know.

1 Let's get out of here.	Somehow, you're better. Different. You're getting ready to go. And I say...

1 Wait! I need those!	There is no softer ground than town.

1 Were you and my father having an affair?	Wow. Wow, you just said it. I was expecting to dance around this for another half hour.
2 I've seen him with women. He flirts. He always has. On some level, I presumed he was cheating on my mother. I just never had proof.

1 It's bad.	It's more than they thought. They're going to stop chemo.
2 You need to go.	Probably tonight.

1 Is that Dr. Bennett's car?	He's up with your father.

1 Is he awake?	He just fell asleep. Josephine's with him.

1 It's enough isn't it?	What do you mean?
2 You know what I mean babe, It's enough. We can stop.	Do you want to stop?
3 Yes.	We'll stop then.

1 How's that? We can't drink our piss can we?	Hang on hang on, sorry, but like, who are you?
2 You must find some glasses, small, for the toast, and some plates.	What are you doing here?

1 She says 'Hello' to you. Go for it John!	Uh. Do you like England?
2 Classic!  Thank God. She says 'Yes!'

1 What did he say? Tell me!	He says you are very sad ridiculous man. I don't agree of course. And that you must pay someone to have sex like a prostitute. Nadia is a prostitute. I'm sorry.
2 What does he want. The Russian shithead. What do you want ?	He wants money.
3 Tell him to put the kettle down and I'll give him money.

1 Today is bath day.	Sorry?

1 You don't have to do this. I can look after myself.	Have you got your passport?
2 What?	Shut up. Have you got your passport?
3 Yes.

1 It wasn't what I wanted.	So what did you want? I think we understand each other, no?
2 You don't understand me.	You don't understand you either.

1 I don't know.	What was her name?
2 What's your name?

1 Hurry. I'll wait for you here.	Right.

1 I brung you a little basket of goodies. Fresh squash, tomatoes, some okra, butter beans.	You didn't have to do this.
2 Just wanted to say how much I appreciate you helping me the other day. My niece, she's cured up, and I got you to thank.	Well that's good. I'm happy to hear it.

1 Hi.	Hey.
2 You ain't the kicker, are you?	No, ma'am.
3 Cuz let me tell you, you boys gotta run the ball more. You get into a kicking game, ya'll gonna lose.	Can I put it in your mouth?
4 Okay.

1 And then you had to fall in love with the school slut.	Now wait...
2 With all she was doin'. With all the shit she kept doing! You stayed stuck to that bitch's ass and you wouldn't let go.	I know about how she was like. But we was different. I's the only person she talked to about it. How she's abused. Terrible things, Gill, just terrible...

1 You wanna go home?	It gets worse there. Leavin' me to my own mind. That's just not good.
2 Here. Pound this and I'll join you.

1 GODDAMMIT, RAE!	BOY! YOU KEEP THAT GUN POINTED AT ME!  You need to kill a man, all you gotta have is a good reason.  You know she been here with me, don't cha? Been all over town, givin' up that switch you thought was your own.
2 SHUT UP! SHUT UP!	Put all your love and dreams into one woman... she turn around and give it all to another man. That's a good reason to paint the wall with me, kid. She'd fear ya then. Cuz there won't be no more question in her mind. She with a real man now. A real KILLER!

1 Now, no harm's come to you... and I aim to keep it that way. Ain't gonna... gonna run a train over ya... or however you call it... see... you was runnin' wild on me... these fever dreams you was havin'... these fits. I'd be chasin' you all night.	Well I'm woke now... you can take this off.

1 My Daddy was one of the first mens to organize soil conservation in these parts. That's a group of farmers, you know, each season they'd rotate the crop. Know why it's best to rotate em like that?	Uh-uh.

1 Could you do somethin' for me?	Anything.

1 Laz? Can I sleep with you tonight?	Don't think that'd be wise.
2 I didn't mean it nothin' dirty.	I know you didn't. But you a grown girl. You can handle it. I got to.

1 You ever seen a train run on a woman?	Nuh-uh.
2 Meanin' like a team of fellas go to work on her and she don't even break a sweat.  She into football, you know. You got a letter on your jacket you get that pussy in ya lap. I ain't playin'.

1 Why don't you go'on and ask her. She need to talk wit somebody with sense. Folks been ruttin' and beatin' on this gal all her days. And this is how I'm handling it.	THIS IS HOW YOU HANDLING IT? THIS IS HOW YOU HANDLING IT?

1 You won't at the square this mornin'.	Get me ten bags of mulch.
2 Yes'sir.

1 I think if I just piss... I'll be okay.	You feelin' sick?
2 I'm just in one of my moods. You know how I get.	Yeah, I know.

1 I'm sorry... I didn't mean to shout...	All my life I been puttin' out your fires, with you givin' out your snatch to every waggin' dick in this town. And you gonna lay the blame at my feet? Well, I ain't gonna take that.
2 But... Momma... just tell me... not gonna be mad... we can just talk about it... Be eye to eye on this... You don't even got to say you're sorry... Just say how you knew...	Only thing I'm sorry for is listenin' to my parents and having you instead of doin' what I should'a done.

1 Nick, let's go hunting.  Bag Cavello.	Charlie...

1 Nick... You up?	No.

1 It's incredible.  Hit him or something.	I don't think he'd feel it.

1 Where do we start looking for this guy?	Where would you look for the mafia?

1 How'd you get this?	I stole them.

1 Chikuwa, Hampen, Kobu, Konnayaku, Ganmodoki --	Ichiro --
2 Broiled fish paste cake, Kelp roll, soybean curd, devils tongue --	Smells like Bayonne at low tide.

1 It's very small.	Big enough.
2 It's illegal, Nick.	It's a new deal.  ... coming with me tomorrow?
3 Sugai's not going to be impressed with your gun, Nick.  No.  I won't put myself in danger for you anymore.

1 What's that for?	Luck.

1 She ever pull down her shades?	Sure, but then I just pull out the photos.

1 You'll get Ich killed.	No one's keeping him here.
2 Bullshit, Nick.  And don't tell me this is all just about Charlie. It's not.	Why would you care?

1 Doesn't speak a word of English. And he won't speak Japanese either. No papers.  The Japanese embassy is very interested.	Why?
2 He's wanted in Japan.  They want him first.  Then we can have him.	What?

1 Hey...!  HEY, I'M TALKING TO YOU, INSPECTOR!	Twenty-four hours, detective.

1 Can't thank you enough, Mr. Sebastian. If you hadn't come along...	We were worried to death.  It's awfully kind of you.

1 I want more life, fucker.	Come here.

1 Show me something?	Like what?
2 Like...

1 I want to do it.	Okay, but don't kill him.  Save a little for everybody.  A masterpiece.

1 If you don't, we will.  It has to be total, Deckard.  That's an order from as high as it comes.  Got it?	Yeah.  I got it.
2 Go.

1 Prosit.	Prosit.

1 Don't make me laugh.  It makes me pee.	Sorry.
2 Hey, it's okay.  I like to pee. So how are you doing?	I'm doing okay.
3 From what I hear you're doing great.  Bryant tells me you're going like a god damn one-man army.  Making a lot of money, huh?	Yeah.  But that's what I wanted to talk to you about.
4 Money?	No.  I got a problem.
5 Let's hear it.	I think I'm starting to empathize with these Nexus-sixes.

1 You see I lost my contacts a couple of days ago around here somewhere and my sight is a little... What am I supposed to be looking for?	Do you recognize any of them?

1 Me.	And who do I go to about you?

1 There's two reasons a man rejects help.  Either because he's so good at what he does he doesn't think he needs it, or he's so insecure he can't admit it.	Sounds like I'm an ass-hole either way, but the answer is still no.
2 Two of us might be more effective than one.	I work alone.

1 What do people do in the afternoon?	If they are smart, they take naps.

1 Why do you call it retire, why don't you call it murder?	Because it's not.
2 Don't you think anything that can suffer deserves to be considered?	Andies only simulate suffering -- if they're programmed for it.
3 Do you think I simulated what happened between us?	No, I don't.

1 She didn't know?	Memory implant.  She was programmed. But I think she has transcended her conditioning.  I think she was beginning to suspect.

1 Whatcha mean, I'm not helping?	I mean you're not helping! Why is that, Leon?

1 Twenty.	What's your problem?

1 I'm Nina Aron, Adam.	How do you do?
2 Very well, thank you. I'm with the County Family Services Department. Eve tells me you've been living in a bomb shelter most of your life.	Fallout shelter. There's a difference.
3 Adam, I'd like to introduce you to my associate -- Mr. Brown.

1 Bon soir, mademoiselle!	Are you French?
2 No.  I'm from out of town.  I'm here on business.	Well, your business must not be sports memorabilia, because this one Mantle card right here--  --is worth six thousand dollars all by its little self.

1 Rogers Hornsby's worth like four thousand dollars!	So what?!  I've got two of him!  And this many DiMaggios and Robinsons. I was holding these out, too.

1 Wait, Eve, please!  Wait.	Please don't follow me.  Don't do it!

1 Pick you up at eight tomorrow morning.	Hey, you know. I was thinking...
2 Night!

1 Why, thank you!  Very nice to have met you, Cliff!  May I ask you a question?	He's a former boyfriend. We lived together for about six months.  And yes, I'll admit it.  I've still kind of got a thing for him.  That's what you wanted to know, isn't it?
2 Actually,no. I was wondering why Cliff likes to wear another man's underpants.	What?!

1 He's going to kill himself.  Go skate out on the bike path! It's that way!	Okay!

1 That's ridiculous.	Maybe. But that's how it works.

1 I went to Sophie's and she was very hospitable.	Is that what you call it?
2 But it just wasn't where I wanted to be so I left as politely as I could and found a taxi.  But I asked the driver to drop me here instead of at the hotel.  There's a song Mister Como sings called "On the Street Where You Live."  You know it?	Sing it to me.
3 "All at once am I--several stories high-- knowing I'm--on the street-- where you live."  It's about a young man who is overjoyed just to be standing in front of the house of the person he loves.

1 Are you all right?	Yes!  Yes!  Oh, Lord!  Yes, oh, yes! But  where is the one who came last night -- all in yellow?!
2 All in yellow?  Oh!  That was my father!	Ooooohhhh!!  Of course! The father! Forgive me!!  Can you forgive me for my wasted life?!  Everything has been so awful!!
3 I know it has been terrible.  But it wasn't your fault. And now all the decay is over with and things are going to get better. You understand?	Yes.
4 I've got to go, now.	Of course you do.  I'll stay here and pray.
5 That's always a good idea! Would you like some money? I have a great deal of it.	No. I don't need money anymore -- I see that now.
6 How do I leave here?	The front door is open.  Will you be back?
7 I promise.

1 C'est bon, Monsieur.	Merci!

1 I've got goose-bumps all over me.	Why not just go to... Nome for supplies and a wife?  Isn't that closer?

1 I'm sorry. I took the Lord's name in vain again, didn't I?  I'm so sorry.	No!  There's an Adult Bookstore back there!  I'll be right back!

1 Whatcha looking at?	Oh, my holy stars! A Negro!
2 Say what?!	How do you do, ma'am.
3 I do alright.	Good!

1 I'm afraid you've got to.	I'll be all right.
2 You're my brave boy.

1 Oh, my God!	He'll catch him.  Hi. This is Nina Aron.  I've got a run away and I'm going to need police assistance.
2 No!  Not the police!  Don't call them!	I have to. If a complaint is made and the person resists obser--
3 No, I can't have that! They'll come with their cars and their guns and their handcuffs--	Calm down, please. This man needs help and you need protection from him. That's obvious.
4 You know, I don't think so. I'm confused but you know, I don't think he'd ever hurt me. I don't think he'd hurt anyone.	And now you must let me be the judge of that!
5 I was frightened and I didn't know what to think! But you know-I believe him. I think he just wants to go home. Wherever the hell that is...	Let's all remain calm. That's the key thing.

1 How long will we have to stay down here?	I don't know. For this thing to blow over, it could take days.
2 Days??	Rather safe than sorry. That's my motto!
3 But, what if I go into labor? That could happen any time.	I've read up on it. I'll deliver the baby myself if I have to.
4 Now you listen to me Calvin Webber, when this baby comes, you're going to be out in the waiting room smoking yourself to death with all the other fathers.	Yes, dear!
5 As long as we've got that straight.

1 No.  I think it's just right.	And I was wondering...if...if I could have a...
2 Yes!	If I...you know...
3 What? Whatever you want, Helen!

1 One who doesn't glow in the dark.	Calvin Webber! What a thing to say!
2 Well, we'll be going up in two years. We'll know then. I'm very hopeful.

1 He's smart.	Yes, dear, I know.

1 Eve!  This guy is un-be-liev-able!	I knew you'd like him.
2 Darlin', this is X-File stuff!  Think about it!  The guy's got all this easily negotiable property. He's obviously setting something up very big.  Like a self-sustaining island off the coast of South America, for instance. Or perhaps he's the head of a cult that's doing weird things with poultry and pipe tobacco. I've heard worse.

1 That water's freezing!	He's from Alaska.

1 What are you going to do? Go over to her place and kick in the door?	You're goddamn right I am!

1 Adam!!	Where?!
2 Stop!

1 Jeffrey, you're not going down by Lincoln, are you?	No, I'm just going to walk around the neighborhood. Don't worry.

1 Are you Detective Williams?	Yes.
2 My name is Jeffrey Beaumont - I live near you. I believe you know my father, Tom Beaumont - Beaumont's Hardware Store?	Sure I do. I understand he's in the hospital. How is he?
3 He's alright, I guess. I hope. They're doing tests, that's why I'm home from school. I was over at the hospital this morning and I was going home and in the field behind our neighborhood. There behind Vista, I found an ear.	You did? A human ear?
4 Yeah. I've got it here in this bag. I thought I should bring it to you.	Yep, that's right. Let's take a look at it.

1 And that man came out with a third man - this well-dressed guy. Here's the photo. I think a girl named Dorothy Vallens is in trouble with these people. I think Frank has taken her husband and her son.	I have no hard proof of any of this. Her address is also on the photos. I think these people are involved with drugs, and murder. I think Frank is killing drug dealers and...  ...and somehow Frank is getting all their drugs. I had to tell you I got slightly more involved in this than you wanted me to, but it's over now for sure. I had to tell you about these things in case it could help.
2 Well now Jeffrey, how did you come to get so involved?	I can't tell you the whole story. I. I took it upon myself. I can't say more.
3 Is Sandy part of this?	No, not at all.
4 Who knows you have these?	Only you and the photo lab.
5 You're all through with this now?	Yes sir. I sure am.

1 Do you like talk like that?	No.
2 Lie down on the bed.

1 Hi, can I come in?	Yeah, hurry up though.

1 Do you like my body?	Sure I do.

1 I'll call you.	Okay. Soon? Do you think I'm too fat?
2 What?	I'm getting a little bit fat. I hate that.
3 You look beautiful to me.

1 Where are we going, Frank?	Hey Tits, I'm taking your neighbor to the country. Maybe something for you too.
2 Frank?	You want to see him too, right?
3 Yes, but.	Then, shut up!

1 What are you lookin' at?	Nothing.
2 Don't look at me, Fuck. I shoot when I see the whites of the eyes.  You like me?

1 God, you scared me.	Is something wrong? What's happened to your face?
2 Nothing. I'm fine.	You can't just stay out half the night and carry on, Jeffrey. There's got to be some order, Jeffrey. I thought it would have been nice to call your father when you got home but now it is much too late.

1 Hey, you ivy league shit. COME HERE!	Later Mike. I gotta take care of someone who's hurt here, in case you haven't noticed.

1 I've gotta go in.	Thanks for the tour. It was nice talking to you.

1 You really want to do this, don't you?	I don't want you to get involved, really, I mean, I do, but if something went wrong I mean, like you said, they may be involved in murder.

1 You want to tell me about it?	OK. It's a strange world, Sandy. This is what I have found out. What I think I have found out. Dorothy Vallens is married to a man named Don. They have a son. I think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named Frank who has now cut off both of Don's ears. I think he is holding them to make her do things for him. I think she wants to die. The ears were for her a warning to stay alive. There is another man involved. I call him the "yellow man". You saw his back the other day in the hall at her door. I don't know what he does but I think he's on drugs supplied by Frank. Frank is a very dangerous man.
2 Wow. Should you tell my father?	I don't see how I can, and I can't prove any of this. I got all this information illegally. Also it could get you in trouble.
3 You saw a lot in one night.	Actually. I've been in twice.
4 Twice. Without her sensing anything?	Yes.
5 Did you see her undressed?	Yeah. I mean a little, you know.
6 Yeah?	That doesn't bother you, does it?
7 Who, me? Why should it?	That's what I thought.
8 You're sure right. It is a strange world.	Why are there people like Frank. Why is there so much trouble in this world?
9 I don't know. I had a dream. In fact, the night I met you.  In the dream the world was dark because there weren't any robins. You know, birds. Robins stood for love, and all of a sudden thousands of robins flew down and brought this blinding light of love. And it felt like that love would be the only thing that would make any difference. I guess, until the robins come there is trouble.	Yeah I guess so.  You're a neat girl.
10 So are you.  I mean you're a neat guy. We better get back.	I guess so. You want to help me watch Frank? I'm going to stake out Frank's place tomorrow with a camera.

1 Okay.	What is it?
2 Just some fatherly advice.

1 Please get to your father and send him and the police to Dorothy's apartment right away. Be sure your father comes. Something is happening over there. They're hurting someone, the guy she loves. Tell them to hurry. I'm going over right now.	No Jeffrey!!
2 Yes I'm going. I have to. I love you. I will, believe me.

1 Listen kid, I think you better understand who you're dealing with here.	Yeah. I was only twelve or thirteen when you guys used to talk about him, like he was a ghost or something.
2 Your dad and I used him three times over twenty years, only when everything went totally fucked. Believe me kid, you don't want this guy unless you are 100% sure you need him. He is... a fuckin' monster.

1 Oh, God! Don't kill me! We're on the same side! The boss musta sent you in as back up, huh? Oh, shit, please! I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man.  They call me the funny fuckin' man!	Where's your gun?
2 Chest pocket.  Shit!	This is a six-shooter.

1 Anybody see ya?	Fuck, man! I may as well have posted flyers. Right out in public, man.

1 They got nothing.	This guy is very sharp. If he hasn't figured us out yet, he will.

1 Well, we tried ta make friends and she gave me a shot ta the nuts.	What... the dirty bitch! I hope ya trounced her a good one!
2 Well, I didn't but...

1 Would someone please come over here and...	Fuck!
2 me up the...	Ass!

1 "Now, that wasn't too polite, was it?"	"I'm afraid we can't let that one go, Ivan."

1 We're doing some serious shit here. Now, get a hold of yourself, asshole.	Asshole!? I'm not the rope-totin' Charlie Bronson wanna-be that's getting' us lost!
2 Sh, sh! Fuck you!

1 That's the guy that got us off the hook with the "Checkov" thing.	And he is one smart man.

1 She was in here when it went down.	Can she I.D. them?
2 They were wearing masks.	Of course they were. How many?
3 Three.

1 The two bullets went in here, through the top of the skull, criss-crossed and exited through the eyeballs. This one clue tells us three distinct facts. Number one... Duffy.	They shot him at a downward angle.  They put him on his knees.
2 Excellent! Number two. Greenly.

1 While Greenly's getting coffee, anybody else want anything?	Shit! Shit!

1 Promise me boys.	We promise.

1 Those rat fucks! All of them were all laughing at me man!	You sure you killed them?

1 We'll keep going, Roc.	You'll make it outta here. You can't ever stop, not ever.

1 Do your thing Father. Don't fuck this up.	What do you want me to say?
2 Just be natural, goddamit.	How long since your last confession, my son?

1 Did you see what I meant about the window?	Kind of. Except we've already got the keys.
2 That's true. But what if they change the locks?	Would they do that?
3 Who knows? That's why I filed it down.

1 But he didn't say anything.	Hang on a second.

1 Holy shit.	We got it. We got it.

1 Armored trucks are very difficult to steal, Anthony.	I know. But once you get inside you're home free.
2 Right. Get back to me on that one. Once your plan is worth a shit.	It's not a plan. It's just --
3 Actually. If you knew the exact route, you could plant explosives under a manhole cover and blow it up as it went over.	Yeah, but you wouldn't have the truck if you blew it up.
4 True.

1 See, now we've got a plan.	Don't worry about it, Bob.

1 I can't believe he just jumped you.	Can you hand me those french fries.

1 Who's in the car?	That's Applejack. You want to meet him?
2 Sure.

1 No fighting. It wasn't Bob's fault.	Easy, Dignan. It's OK.

1 Uh-huh?	Take your second position.
2 OK. Roger.

1 You're kidding.	Applejack's stuck in the elevator?

1 Does it float?	We're not sure yet. It's going to need some repairs.

1 You mean like techniques?	Technique. That's right. Seventy- five percent of your job is crowd control. Seventy-five percent. Do you believe that?

1 Well, he agreed 100% that Bob should be dropped. And he also agreed you were a liability. But he felt his talent would make up for your weaknesses.	That sounds like Dignan.

1 Let them fight.	Let them fight.

1 Anthony, I --	And if Future Man doesn't get let out of jail in 48 hours, then we go back. All right?

1 Give him a second.	Hopscotch. The code name is hopscotch.

1 Were you born in Mexico?	Cuba.
2 Oh, really? That's interesting. Do you prefer Cuba or the United States?

1 That's Anthony.	That's your friend Anthony?
2 Yeah.	What's he doing here?
3 Looks like he's staying with Buckethead. That's what I figured. He's probably got his own room. Let's see where he's going.

1 If you're that worried, maybe we should just steal one.	What are you talking about, Bob?
2 Can you use a coaster.

1 Bob.	I'm paying attention. I just want to look at it for a minute.
2 What's your fucking problem? You're a shithead!	I just want to see how much bullets it takes.

1 I mean, Jesus Christ, Bob. You didn't have some vicious lunatic screaming, "I'm going to remember you!"	That's true. That would give me nightmares.
2 Bob, I've got nightmares.

1 How long has he been in there?	I don't know.
2 Then how come they haven't set the bail yet? That's unconstitutional.	We'll have to see when we get back.

1 You said 48 hours!	I never agreed to that.
2 Bob, you're lying!	Bullshit.
3 All right! Backyard! Right now!

1 Is he breathing?	I think so.

1 I might have mentioned it.	John, I'm twenty-six years old I didn't run away from home.
2 I know, Bob. You were on a secret mission.	I'd appreciate it if you didn't go around telling people lies about me.
3 Right. I'm sorry.  You've got a reputation to think about.

1 Is he good?	He's damn good.

1 I don't know.	She is a good looking woman.

1 He left yesterday on the night train. He's probably just getting in now.  You'll have to hurry.	Bourne comes here? Why?

1 Moscow? What the Hell's he going to Moscow for?	Don't know.
2 Jesus... I, Zorn... I have to call his family. Tell them...	I'm sorry, Ward.

1 It changes things. That knowledge. Doesn't it?	Yes...
2 That's not what happened to your parents.	Then what?
3 I killed them.

1 What do you want?	Conklin.
2 He's dead.

1 No... How?	The Telegraph office.
2 But we were so careful.	We pushed it. We got lazy.

1 God, I miss you. I don't know what to do without you.	Jason. You know exactly what to do. That is your mission now.

1 It's me.	Bourne?

1 -- so there were two of these explosive charges placed on the power lines. One of them failed. The fingerprint...  That's from the one that didn't go off.	And the Germans can't match it?

1 -- who? -- who else is here? --	-- no! -- not me! -- no other people! --
2 -- shut up! -- just shut the --

1 Is it fresh?	It's got caffeine in it. That's all I know.

1 Did the priest say anything about the Resurrection? Or was it all about Judgment?	It was in Latin, sir.
2 Non loquis Latinum? You don't speak Latin? We have to fix that, won't we?  Did he give the poetic benediction? The Lord bless thee and keep thee? Patris Benefactum et --  ...It was Malcolm's favorite.

1 If I pay homage to another's throne, then how am I a king?	Homage is nothing. It is the crown that matters!
2 The crown is that of Scotland. And Scotland is William Wallace.	That is another matter. There is a price to all this, required both by Longshanks and our nobles. Pay it, and you will be our king. And we will have peace.

1 Shut up, would you! How can I concentrate?!	...His majesty was quite keen that you should understand --
2 All so very boring! He wants me to learn to fight too, so let me do it!

1 The Bruce is not coming, William.	Mornay has come. So will the Bruce.

1 Can you do it when it matters? As it matters in battle? Could you crush a man with that throw?	I could crush you like a roach.

1 No. I have it to ease the suffering of the children of this war.	This is what happens when you must send a woman. And a fool.
2 Forgive me, Sire. I thought that generosity might demonstrate your greatness to those you mean to rule.	My greatness is better demonstrated with this.

1 This Scottish rebel... Wallace? He fights to avenge a woman?	A magistrate wished to capture him, and found he had a secret lover, so he cut the girl's throat to tempt Wallace to fight -- and fight he did.

1 You understand. Consider, before you laugh and say no. You will never own a throne, though you deserve one. But just as the sun will rise tomorrow, some man will rule England. And what if his veins ran not with the blood of Longshanks, but with that of a true king?	I cannot love you for the sake of revenge.
2 No. But can you love me for the sake of all you loved and lost? Or simply love me... because I love you?

1 Come, it'll help you sleep.	Aye. But it won't let me dream.

1 We're gonna be late again.	When did you ever care about getting to school on time?
2 We're putting up pictures for Parent's Night.

1 Please, mom. People will talk.	I can't help it. I'm just so proud of you. You've got the highest grades in all of your classes.
2 Did Da -- Jason --- get good grades?	Please. He got straight A's without ever touching a book. That was the one area where his memory never failed him.
3 Ma? Did he ever say that he figured out a way to recall a lost memory years after he blacked it out for the first time?

1 Just. Like. Jason.	Don't worry. I'm gonna get you out of here.

1 Go on. Nothing can hurt you. Remember, this is only a movie. You're completely safe.	I can't... the car vanishes and all of a sudden I'm on the ground in the woods.
2 The car doesn't vanish Evan. The movie in your head has broken, that's all. But now I've re-spliced it and I want you to tell me about the car.	It's coming... argh! I can't!

1 Are you stupid or what?	What?
2 Shucks, I dunno. But maybe there's a reason why you've repressed the one day when some old lecher had you in your tighty whities, dammit!

1 Did your mom say if Lenny was... okay?	He must be. They're letting him go, right?

1 Oh my God, that was good. Where'd you learn all those new tricks?	So it didn't feel... weird?
2 Yeah, if you call multiple orgasms weird.

1 Oh, I thought you were my eight o'clock. Make it fast, I'm expecting someone.	Nice to see you, too. Can I come in?

1 Kayleigh? Do you ever think about "us?" I mean, wonder if it could ever have been different between the two of us?	Sure, Evan, why not? You were the first person I really ever cared about.
2 I was?	That's why when I was little I never went to live with my mother.
3 I don't get it.	When my folks split, they gave me and Tommy a choice who we wanted to live with. I couldn't stand my dad, but I knew if I moved to my mom's I'd never see you again.
4 I never knew that. So then you still sometimes think of us... together?	It's crossed my mind from time to time.
5 And...?	Well a lot of things cross my mind. I've always been a fast thinker, Ev. I can play out the movie of our entire lives in under a second. Boom -- we fall in love -- get married -- two kids, your keen analytical insight matched to my generous nature -- kids grow old as do we, relatively stable relationships, matching burial plots, the whole bit. It took a lot longer to spit out than to imagine.
6 Then you think it might have worked out?	Why not? But that's not how things wound up. I'm with Lenny, Lenny's your friend. And there it ends.

1 Are you okay? You looked like you were somewhere else for a second there.	Look, Jason, I need some fast answers if I'm ever gonna fix what I've done.

1 Smells like sex in here.	Thumper had a busy afternoon.
2 You're kidding. He's so... big.

1 Are you sure you even packed it?	My mom packed for me. I think she sent everything I ever owned. So we'll see.

1 Lung cancer?	Sorry, Mrs. T. He's been out of sorts lately.

1 Maybe it went out. Should someone check it?	Yeah, you do that, Lenny.

1 Good.	What is your name?
2 Berger, Norwegian, and at your service, sir.

1 I want you to take Miss Lund home.	Yes, sir.

1 Shall we draw up the papers, or is our handshake good enough?	It's certainly not good enough. But since I'm in a hurry, it'll have to do.

1 And Mademoiselle?	You needn't be concerned about me.

1 Strange. I know so very little about you.	I know very little about you, just the fact that you had your teeth straightened.

1 How did you get in?	The stairs from the street.

1 No, Richard, no. What has happened to you? Last night we said --	-- Last night we said a great many things. You said I was to do the thinking for both of us. Well, I've done a lot of it since then and it all adds up to one thing. You're getting on that plane with Victor where you belong.
2 But Richard, no, I, I --	-- You've got to listen to me. Do you have any idea what you'd have to look forward to if you stayed here? Nine chances out of ten we'd both wind up in a concentration camp. Isn't that true, Louis?

1 I must find out what Berger knows.	Be careful.
2 I will, don't worry.

1 Whatever I'd say, you'd carry on. Victor, why don't you tell me about Rick? What did you find out?	Apparently he has the letters.
2 Yes?	But no intention of selling them. One would think if sentiment wouldn't persuade him, money would.

1 I can't get over you two. She was asking about you earlier, Rick, in a way that made me extremely jealous.	I wasn't sure you were the same. Let's see, the last time we met --

1 Are you enough of a businessman to appreciate an offer of a hundred thousand francs?	I appreciate it, but I don't accept it.
2 I'll raise it to two hundred thousand.	My friend, you could make it a million francs, or three, my answer would still be the same.
3 There must be some reason why you won't let me have them.	There is. I suggest that you ask your wife.
4 I beg your pardon?	I said, ask your wife.
5 My wife?

1 No, Captain, please.	No. Please, Monsieur, it is a little game we play. They put it on the bill, I tear the bill up. It is very convenient.

1 I am making out the report now. We haven't quite decided whether he committed suicide or died trying to escape.	Are you quite finished with us?

1 Oh, there is no hurry. Tonight he'll be at Rick's. Everybody comes to Rick's.	I have already heard about this cafe, and also about Mr. Rick himself.

1 Mademoiselle.	Mademoiselle.

1 You know, I think now I shall pay a call on Yvonne, maybe get her on the rebound, eh?	When it comes to women, you're a true democrat.

1 Oh, laugh if you will, but I happen to be familiar with your record. Let me point out just two items. In 1935 you ran guns to Ethiopia. In 1936, you fought in Spain on the Loyalist side.	And got well paid for it on both occasions.
2 The winning side would have paid you much better.	Maybe. Well, it seems you are determined to keep Laszlo here.
3 I have my orders.	Oh, I see. Gestapo spank.

1 As I suspected, you're a rank sentimentalist.	Yeah? Why?
2 Why do you interfere with my little romances?	Put it down as a gesture to love.
3 Well, I forgive you this time. But I'll be in tomorrow night with a breathtaking blonde, and it will make me very happy if she loses. Uh huh!

1 I suppose you know what you're doing, but I wonder if you realize what this means?	I do. We've got plenty of time to discuss that later.
2 Call off your watch-dogs you said.	Just the same, you call the airport and let me hear you tell them. And remember, this gun's pointed right at your heart.
3 That is my least vulnerable spot.

1 Make it official, if you like.	What is your nationality?
2 I'm a drunkard.

1 Thank you.  Will you have a drink with me please?	No.
2 I forgot. You never drink with...  I'll have another, please.  You despise me, don't you?	If I gave you any thought, I probably would.
3 But why? Oh, you object to the kind of business I do, huh? But think of all those poor refugees who must rot in this place if I didn't help them. That's not so bad. Through ways of my own I provide them with exit visas.	For a price, Ugarte, for a price.
4 But think of all the poor devils who cannot meet Renault's price. I get it for them for half. Is that so parasitic?	I don't mind a parasite. I object to a cut-rate one.
5 Well, Rick, after tonight I'll be through with the whole business, and I am leaving finally this Casablanca.	Who did you bribe for your visa? Renault or yourself?
6 Myself. I found myself much more reasonable.

1 Where is she? Have you seen her?	No, Mr. Richard. I can't find her.

1 Polaris, where are you?  Maybe I'm too far south.	You don't know where you are.  You missed the shipping lanes.
2 Moon's too bright.

1 They're never going to see you.  You're just another piece of trash in the ocean.	They're on autopilot.
2 They're always on autopilot.  Or else it's night, or you're in the sun, or you're in the trough of a wave.  They'll never see you.	Damn it!  Don't be so negative!

1 Hmmm.  Feels like it might have gotten wet.	Possible.  So you did those wings?
2 Yeah.  A long time ago.	They're harder to do than they look.
3 Oh?  You've tried?	Well, I do a little drawing --

1 My last chapter's in there, and the damn machine's jammed.	Let's take a look.

1 Look, I love the puppy.  I love you.  But I have to go.	You can't go now.
2 I have to.	You want to.

1 I didn't want to.  It just happened.  One day Gary was there.  He took care of everything.  He took care of me.  I was a mess.	You have any children?

1 What will you do?	I don't know.  I really don't know.

1 Doc, I'm not on the island.  I'm not on the raft.  I'm alive.  I'm so glad to be back, I can't tell you.  I just want out of here.	Well, when that IV runs out, you're through with us.  Just the dentist tomorrow.

1 It seemed like she had such a good time last time.	It's nothing you did, Mom, believe me.

1 Hmmm.  Durango, Colorado; Asheville, North Carolina, then...canceled her account.	Can you find her?
2 You're looking at a Level III search. For your Level III, you gotta have E-4 authorization.  I don't have it.

1 Malaysia's tanking.  We're meeting in ten in operations.	Right.  Get me everything on Indonesia, New Guinea, all the way to Australia.

1 To Wilson.	To Wilson.

1 Only if you can afford it.	Try to think of nothing, Dorothy.

1 Oh my, yes! This is a *far* superior taste--and crisp, too! You know, so many apples are disappointingly mealy. I wonder of most of the apples in my life weren't meant for pies!	Wilbur, he picked them for us himself...
2 You don't find it depressing that Homer Wells is picking apples?

1 It's gettin' late. I think I'll pack it in.	Good night, Daddy.

1 Uh... have you been *feeling* okay?	When I'm not thinking about Wally. I'm not good at being alone.  Oh, goodness. You meant... yes, I'm fine. I...  ...I don't suppose you've seen a lobster yet.

1 The screen is enormous! Imagine King Kong up *there*! Have you seen a lot of movies here?	Yes... and no. When you come here, you don't really care about the movie.

1 Do you think I'm having a good time? Do you think I'm just *teasing* you? Do you think I *know* whether I want you or Wally?	So we should "wait and see." For how long?
2 I grew up with Wally. I began my adult life with him.	Fine. That's all there is to it then.
3 No! That's not all there is to it! I love you, too--I *know* I do.	Okay, okay--I know you do, too.
4 It's a good thing I didn't have that baby, isn't it?

1 Do you think she'll be all right?	She knows how to take care of herself.

1 I'm okay--I can walk.	I don't want you to walk--I want to carry you. Should I put the top up? It might get cold.
2 No--keep it down. I want to feel the air.

1 That's a heavy sedation.	You *bet* it's a heavy sedation! The fetus is unexpelled, her uterus is punctured, she has acute peritonitis, and there's a foreign object. I think it's a crochet hook.

1 Uh... it's the end of October.	Is that soon?

1 "Burma run" because you fly over Burma...	*And* over the Himalayas. That's called flying over the hump.

1 That's better. I can tell you got yourself some education. Them's good hands you got, Homer. Them hands you got, they know what they're doin'-- ain't that right?	I guess so...

1 What's that? What's it called?	One cervical stabilizer, two sets of dilators--Douglas points. One medium- sized curette, one small; one medium speculum, one large; two vulsellum forceps.
2 There ain't no *almost* about this stuff, Homer--ain't that right?

1 Fuzzy is not uncommon. I tell you, there's something about the premature babies of alcoholic mothers. They seem susceptible to every damn thing that comes along.	I haven't read that.
2 I haven't, either. But you *will*. The morons who write the books should do a little research *here*.	But isn't Fuzzy just... well, underdeveloped?
3 When *doesn't* he have bronchitis? I wouldn't call his bronchial infections "underdeveloped." Would you?

1 I don't need this--I know all about my condition.	It's your heart--you ought to take it with you.

1 What's that?	It's just my heart.
2 What you got a picture of your heart for?

1 That's *it*?	That's it.
2 It means nothin' at all! And all this time I been *wonderin'* about it!

1 They told me I was too old to serve.	They told Muddy his feet was too flat!

1 She's *good* with that knife! She's real fast. She's a lot better with that knife than *you* is, Muddy! And who do you suppose taught her?	*You* taught her, I suppose...
2 That's right! A girl's gotta know how to defend herself, don't she?

1 You're lucky he didn't cut your *nipples* off, man.	The good news, Jack, is you're half- undressed for *swimmin'*...
2 Yeah, that cigarette ain't hard to find when you're properly undressed.

1 Oh. Well, thanks for the drink.	You're welcome. I was just going to ask you if you'd like to join us.

1 Hey, Jake... When am I gonna get to play the Inside?	Gordo plays the inside. You're the Shill.
2 Yeah, but come on... All I get to do is cry and get insulted.	What are you talking about? You should get a fucking Academy Award for the Shill work you do.  We got it down cold, Al. You don't want to jinx it by changing something up, do you?
3 I'm gonna go get eggrolls. Anyone want eggrolls?

1 He's just as crooked as the next guy. You'd think he'd have more important things to do with tax payer dollars.	Cue the fucking violins. Come on... It's getting cold.

1 Not that I recall. What do you want us to do about it?	Let's see... Let's suppose he gets to Customs and he gets caught. We get our money back, but then we have to deal with a criminal investigation. I don't much like that idea. Then again, let's suppose he actually gets through Customs. Now, that'll be something. We recover the money in cash and let the insurance cover the corporate fraud. We double our money.
2 So we go to the bar.	I think so. The airport's going to be crawling with police. Traffic will be a nightmare. Go down to the bar. If they pull it off, great. Have someone deal with Ashby.
3 We'll take care of it.	And how much did you say you wanted for this... What did you call it? A finder's fee?

1 Masters of our own destiny.	So far, masters of our own demise. What bank are you with?

1 When?	Tonight. Just me.

1 We're going to make it back, Grant. Three or four times over.	And all you need to do for your ten percent is put some paperwork through and push a button tomorrow.

1 Why?	You ask a lot of questions. Come on.  Let me see 'em.

1 That tip not work-out for you fellas?	Tip was fine, Jake. We were a little more curious about the Fed.
2 Hey, listen... If you guys don't pay your taxes, that's your business.

1 I lost my head. I'm... Sorry. I don't know what happened.	Y-y-you fucking shot him! That's what happened!
2 I had to! That motherfucker was about to welch! You saw what he was doing, right? You heard him!

1 We had to see what your deal was. I'm just a little superstitious.	Here's my deal -- Don't waste my time. What do you want me for anyway? You don't even know me.
2 I just have a good feeling about you. Haven't you ever had someone say they had a good feeling about you before?

1 We're getting down to the wire. Apparently another company has a similar product in R&D right now. If they beat us to it...	Off the record, I'm this close to cutting someone in on the action if it'd help.

1 No. You trusted him... You were just getting square.	You know why I told you that, Jake?  Because I trust you too.

1 Stop waving that thing around.	You sure we're clear?

1 Uh...	What?
2 I'm just thinking out loud here, but... Two million in a briefcase?	Good point.

1 And we got rid of the red head.	Jake? Customs?

1 He's wheeling around two million dollars in cash and he wants to stop to use the bathroom. You believe this?	Maybe he's got it right. Maybe we're all just looking for a safe place to shit.
2 That was fucking deep.

1 The King? Jake, you play the heavy rackets like that... They put the lug on for nothing at all.	I can handle it.
2 I don't doubt your talent. You looking for that place in the hall of fame?	It's not history.
3 So what do you want?	I want to get out from under all this for good. And I want to fuck them all doing it.
4 Then I gotta say, in my opinion, you can't get what you want.

1 Preliminary forensics suggests he was sitting there, bloated and purple in his egg foo young for at least seventy two hours. Alfonse was not a small man and there was a lot of food ordered, so you can imagine the smell. Bad for the neighbors, good for me because in all the time I've been looking for Jake, this is only the second time I've even gotten a whiff of him.	Look Special Agent Moonan... We don't know what you're talking about.

1 You sell it.	To who?
2 Don't be an idiot. How hard do you think it is to sell one drug dealer's drugs to another drug dealer? If Vig's right, we might be looking at a hundred, maybe a hundred fifty grand...	You think this is a good idea? We never did this kinda shit before.
3 What's he going to do? File a missing drugs report? If it works out, this guy might be good for a few more turns.

1 I've been watching you work. You're the best in the place. But you know that.	I despise the job.
2 Ah, we all say that. But if we hate it, why do we do it?

1 Hi-ya... I'll call you back.  Now then...	I want a job, Giles.
2 All right. As what?	I was thinking perhaps I could be a reader. You employ readers, don't you?
3 We do. For unsolicited manuscripts. We pay twenty pounds a manuscript. You might get two, maybe three in a week. Can you live on sixty pounds?

1 No, no. I'm not ready for you. There's some vodka in the freezer.	You want me drunk?
2 I won't be that long.

1 I loved it blond.	It's only hair. I haven't changed.

1 What?	You were talking in your sleep.
2 Not talking. Writing.

1 I'm sorry, madam, we don't accept gratuities in the UK. It's different in South Africa.	You know where I'm from?

1 That trick tonight, I don't think I've ever seen that before.	It can only work with amateurs, A pro would have spotted it.
2 I didn't.	Then you're not a pro.

1 I'm sorry.	What for?
2 I have to take the car.

1 You've been avoiding me.	Have I?
2 I'm Lucy.	And what do you do, Lucy?
3 I'm a witch. A white witch. Why don't we move on?	Are you going to put a spell on me?
4 I might.

1 Does Bella come here?	That bitch? No.

1 You've been recommended by the management here. They know your father. He has a bit of a reputation, hasn't he?	Has he?
2 In any case, I understand you've had some previous experience... in South Africa.  You'll find the rules a little different here. Before we start, you haven't got a police record, have you?	No.

1 You want me to check?	I said good call.

1 Thanks for the information.	A pleasure. Pity about Bella.
2 She was a real asset. But what could I do?

1 It didn't go off.	Oh, God...
2 It didn't go off.	Boiler, we're alive. My heart.

1 Talby, Talby, can you read me?	Can you beat that? I always knew Talby was weird.
2 Talby, can you read me?

1 This is Lieutenant Doolittle calling Bomb #20. I repeat previous order, you are to disarm yourself and return immediately to the bomb bay. Do you understand?	I am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes thirty seconds. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
2 Bomb, this is Doolittle. You are not to detonate, repeat, you are not to detonate in the bomb bay. Disarm yourself. This is an order.	I read you, Lieutenant Doolittle, but I am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.

1 What are you gonna name it?	What?
2 The new star. What are you gonna name it?	Who cares. Don't bother me.

1 You know, Talby, you really ought to eat with the rest of us. You spend too much time up here.	I like it up here.
2 Must get lonely being up here so much.	I don't like to go below since Commander Powell died. I feel enclosed down there. If it were big enough, I'd sleep up here...
3 ...Should spend some time below, see more of the rest of the ship...	...You see, I can watch things up here, Doolittle. I love to watch things, just stare at the planets and meteors and asteroids, gas clusters...
4 You'll have plenty of time for that, you know. Figure it this way: twenty years in space and we've only aged three, so there'll be plenty of time to stare around...	You know, Doollttle, if we're going into the Veil Nebula, we may actually find a strange and beautiful thing: the Phoenix Asteroids. They should be passing through there about now...
5 Phoenix Asteroids? Never heard of 'em.	They are a body of asteroids that make a complete circuit of the universe once every 12.3 trillion years. The Phoenix Asteroids... From what I've heard, Doolittle, they glow... glow with all the colors of the rainbow. Nobody knows why. They just glow as they drift around the universe. Imagine all the sights they've seen in the time they've been travelling -- the birth and death of stars, things we'll never see. The universe is alive, Doolittle. I thought it was all empty, but it isn't. In between the stars, it's seething with light and gasses and dust. There are little pebbles drifting around, planets no one on Earth has ever seen... No one but the Phoenix Asteroids...

1 Commander Powell, this is Doolittle. Ah, there's something serious come up, sir, and I have to ask you something.	I'm glad you've come to talk with me, Doolittle. It's been so long since anyone has come to talk with me.
2 Commander, sir, we have a big problem. You see, the Veil Nebula bomb, Bomb Number 20, is stuck. It won't drop from the bomb bay. It refuses to listen and plans to detonate in --  -- less than eleven minutes.	Doolittle, you must tell me one thing.
3 What's that, sir?	Tell me, Doolittle, how are the Dodgers doing?
4 Well, sir, the Dodgers broke up, disbanded over thirteen years ago.	Ah... pity, pity...
5 You don't understand, sir, we can't get the bomb to drop.	Ah, so many malfunctions... why don't you have anything nice to tell me when you activate me? Oh, well, did you try the azimuth clutch?
6 Yes sir. Negative effect.	What was that, Doolittle?
7 Negative effect.	It didn't work?
8 That's correct, sir.	Sorry, Doolittle. I've forgotten so much since I've been in here. So much.
9 What should we do, sir? The time is running out.	Well, what you might try is --

1 I never woulda done it.  Probably not, anyway.  I mean, I actually think you're pretty cool.	Yeah?

1 Nothing happened between me and Tia.	Leave.  Now.
2 Can I say something in my defense?	No.

1 Lemme put some clothes on.	No time.

1 So Max, what do you do with all your money?	I got overhead...

1 Goodnight Bears.  Goodnight chairs. Goodnight kittens.  Goodnight mittens. Goodnight clocks.  And goodnight socks. Goodnight little house.  And goodnight--	I don't want to move away.
2 I know, Honey, but just think how exiting it will be-- new house, new school, new friends--	But why can't we stay here?
3 Because we can't.  There's nothing here for us anymore.	Are we in some kind of trouble?
4 No...	Then how come last night I heard you talking to Logan and you were crying?

1 How'd you find me?	Wasn't that hard.
2 Am I s'posed to be flattered by all the attention?	Now you know who I am, where I live.  I figured I better find out who I'm dealing with in case you were looking to hurt me.
3 So now you tracked me down.  What d'ya think?	Too early to tell.
4 How does Mrs. Eyes Only like being married to a guy on everybody's hit list?	Lauren's not my wife.
5 Girlfriend?	One of my sources.  Her husband was murdered by Edgar Sonrisa.
6 What's your shot in all this?  Being a famous, anonymous, underground, pirate, cyber-journalist can't be much of a payday.	Fortunately, my needs are met in that department.
7 So, what, you just like the sound of your own voice?	Look around at all this...  Built by people who got up every morning and worked hard trying to make a better life.  Then the bomb happened and everyone got scared.  They blinked and before they knew it they'd given away the store to a bunch of thugs who were happy to take it off their hands.  Overnight the government, the police, everything intended to protect the people had been turned against them.
8 You miss the good ol' days.  Even though there were still poor people who died from diseases when they didn't have to. And rich people spent obscene amounts of money redecorating their houses to match the cat.  Those good ol' days?	People had a choice, even if they took it for granted.  And now they don't.
9 So what are you gonna do about it?	Something.
10 Personally, I'm more interested in going fast on my motorcycle or climbing the Trans American building with my pals. Instead of giving myself a headache over stuff I can't do anything about.	You accept the way things are, you're an active participant in making it worse.
11 Is the social studies class over for today?	Yeah...

1 We got separated right away.  I never knew how many made it.	How well do you remember the lab?
2 I remember fine.  I just didn't understand what was going on.  They never told us anything except what to do.  It took me a long time afterwards to figure things out.	How much do you know?
3 I know they made me.  Even got the label on my neck to prove it.	The technical term for you is "chimera"...
4 Yeah...a made-up creature.  Like in mythology...with the head of a lion, the body of a goat and the tail of...	A girl.
5 Your basic hodge-podge.	Hardly...

1 I'm looking for a lady who works here.	Ladies would be elsewhere.

1 Who's this guy?  This isn't who we're looking for...her name was Hannah.	He got the car in a trade for his old pick-up and some food...no bill of sale or nothing.  It was right after the pulse so all the DMV records were wiped.  So we don't get anything on the seller.  Except I actually managed to find this guy, six hours on the phone... Say thank you.
2 Thank you.	He says he got it from a woman.  Doesn't remember her name but she fits the description you gave like a glove.

1 Zero... C'mon, Dan I don't have all day.	Got a pencil?
2 Just give it to me.  I'll remember.	One-seven-four-nine-five Natoma.
3 I'm on my way.

1 Who are you?	What, you gonna put me on your Christmas card list?

1 Hey, Sketchy--	We gotta talk.
2 What's up?

1 Hot run to 842 Beulah, corner of Haight... And you can tell your pal Theo he just got his worthless ass fired. Not that he cares but the wife and kid might.	Theo's dead.

1 Whoa... she is a killer.	Amanda Finch. Her ex is one of the wealthiest businessmen in Detroit. Play your cards right and you could hit paydirt. She like 'em young.  And since you look a little new at this, let me give you three words of advice. Hard to get. Think it, act it, know it, be it. Nothing a woman loves more than when you beat her at her own head games.

1 Ann Arbor?	My dad's company is relocating him. We're moving. That's why I was acting so freaky in school today. I thought it was the last time I'd ever see you. Anyway, open the box. I would have given it to you this morning, except... like I said, I was freaking out.

1 Namely?	Our band "Mystery" is a quartet and we can't go on the road without our drummer. Jam's mom said something about sending him to St. Bernard's, right? We gotta bust him out before we go anywhere.

1 Will somebody please tell those chicks disco is dead.	Stellas. I hate stellas almost as much as I hate dogs.

1 Ok, dudes, follow my lead.	Wait a minute. We ditching the rest of school?

1 No... You don't think...?	Nah. Couldn't be.

1 Are you on the crapper with one of those antenna phones? Sounds like you're taking a dump the size of Butte, Montana.	It's my Bullworker.
2 Anyway, listen up. They're gone!	What's gone?
3 The KISS tickets, you nimrod! They're just fuckin' gone! Please tell me you have'm!	Gone!? Why would I have the KISS tick...?
4 Just check whatever you were wearing last night. Now!

1 It was stolen!	Christine stole it! Asleep, my ass! The stella booted with your mom's wheels.

1 Someday you'll have a son just like you, Jeremiah. A boy who lies through his teeth, buys demonic records, and smokes the dope just like you.	If I'm anything like you, I'll deserve him.
2 What?!	I said, I'm sorry!
3 If you truly are sorry, son, then you better pray like you've never prayed before. God willed me to find those tickets because He wanted to hear from you.  He knows you need help and He wants you to ask Him for it.

1 Poor, Jam, man. Imagine having to stash your KISS records inside Carly Simon album covers. No question, Mrs. Bruce is a psycho-bitch from hell.	You're one to talk, Lex. Your mom's a fuckin' dyke.

1 Simplicity, Hawk.	Simple-icity is more like it. And you guys thought Jam was in trouble before. Wait till Mrs. Bruce finds out he went to that concert with us.

1 Hey, kid, that's okay. I don't wanna see KISS that ba...	Don't try to run, maggot. Chongo's an all-state track star in every event.
2 What do you want?	A tag on your toe. Nobody threatens me and lives.
3 Look, you can have my wallet...	It's not nearly enough, punk.

1 What was his name?	Donnie. Donnie Darko.

1 "The Last Unicorn!" By Samantha Darko.	Donnie! Give it back!

1 Hey...	Hey...
2 School's cancelled.

1 So when you sleepwalk, can you remember afterward? Like, do you dream?	No. I just wake up and I look around, try to figure out where I am... how I got there.
2 My dad said never wake a sleepwalker... because they could drop dead.

1 I know she's here. She never leaves the house.	Maybe she's asleep.

1 Time is running out. We have to go see Grandma Death. We have to talk to her.	Why? Is this about the book?
2 No. Frank.	Who's Frank?

1 I have to take the girls to Los Angeles tomorrow.	Do you get to meet Ed?
2 If I'm lucky.  So... I won't be back until the first. Your dad will be back on Sunday, so I've put Elizabeth in charge until then. She has the car... so she can drive you to your therapy tomorrow.	How does it feel to have a wacko for a son?
3 It feels wonderful.

1 Ms. Pomeroy... what's going on?	Donnie... it's Friday. Shouldn't you be off with your friends, scaring old people?
2 Where are you going?	I don't know. That's a good question... but suffice to say that I am no longer your English teacher. They fired me.
3 That's bullshit. You're a good teacher.	Thank you, Donnie. And you're a good student. Lazy... but a good student. Unlike most of the others, you question Mom and Dad's rules.
4 What do I tell the rest of the class when they ask about you?	Tell them that everything is going to be just fine.  It is up to the children to save themselves these days. Because the parents... they don't have a clue.

1 I'd like to believe that I'm not... but I've just never seen any proof. So I just choose not to bother with it. It's, like, I could spend my whole life thinking about it... debating it in my head. Weighing the pros and cons. And in the end, I still wouldn't have any proof. So... I don't even debate it any more. Because it's absurd.  I don't want to be alone.  So, does that make me, like, an atheist?	No. That makes you keep searching.

1 Your medication. They're placebos. Just pills made out of water.	Thank you.
2 Donald, an atheist is someone who denies altogether the existence of a God. You are an agnostic. An agnostic is someone who believes that there can be no proof of the existence of God... but does not deny the possibility that God exists.	Goodbye, Dr. Thurman.
3 Goodbye, Donald.

1 I... What can we do?	I would like to put him through more hypnotherapy... and increase his medication.

1 I got twelve classrooms full of water. All coming from a busted water main.	What else?
2 What else? Shit, Principal Cole, you ain't gonna believe what else.

1 All right! 7:55. Everybody goes home.	Let's go to Donnie's house. His parents are both at work.

1 That was your mom. She wanted you to have this.	Really, Loretta?
2 You-betcha.	My mom wanted me to have this?
3 Oh, shut up. I thought it might help you get some sleep.	Loretta, never have kids.
4 Well God-love-ya for thinkin' I still could.

1 Shut up, yous guys. Look, Amber, I'm not gonna win. And let's be honest, a family only needs one "Liza" and you know Peter's got much better legs than me.	Your parents'd kill you.
2 Oh c'mon, I love 'em, but you know they only had me 'cause Peter needed a kidney.	Lis, I want to, I really do, but... Oh, I can't.
3 Then do it for Peter. Mrs. Leeman used to call him a "skinny little fag" when he'd bag her groceries. He'd pop his Nancy-belt if his old jacket somehow, I don't know, got her back.	Yah?
4 Oh-you-beccha.

1 Mom!	I ain't lettin' go ktil you tell me what's up. I'm reaching' a point where I'd kill someone for the nicotine on their fingernails.
2 Okay. Yesterday I... I got this picture. So I kinda, y'know, I'm thinkin' no. I'm gonna, I -- I -- I'm gonna quit the pageant.	What?!

1 What?	You heard me. Where is it?

1 So, uh, I -- I'm not really busy Friday. I just said that -- y'know.	I know.
2 So if, uh, you wanted to do somethin'...

1 Annette, just use your hand.	They told me to practice.

1 Lester?	Oh, all right  How soon they forget where all this comes from.

1 It's a two-hundred dollar fine!	I said I'd move if a cripple came. Let's just run in the store and pick out some outfits.
2 All right, let's go.

1 Excuse me, Father, Mother, when are we moving back to Tokyo? I can't stand this place anymore. They put butter on everything.	English! English, you stupid little retard! We America now, Tina!
2 I'm sorry, Dad, but with all due respect, my name isn't "Tina," it's Seiko.	Tina! Tina!! TINA!!!

1 Father...	Take a letter...

1 You know, I'd be lost without a telephone.  Now - where were we? Oh, yes - I just made you Secretary of War.  The first thing you do is buy ammunition -- you buy it from me and I get 10% commission.	What do I get?
2 You get half mine and I get half yours.	I don't want to buy ammunition -- we no gotta war.
3 Then we've gotta start one. Do you know how to start a war?	Sure, that's easy.  You gotta insult somebody.

1 Now -- how many men you got in your army?	Well, we gotta one hundred thousand men.
2 That's not fair -- we've only got fifty thousand.	That's all right.  We let you have twenty-five thousand men -- and we both start even.
3 That's the spirit -- fifty-fifty.	No. Seventy-five -- seventy-five.
4 Well, we'll let that one go.  Now -- how many battalions you got?	We gotta two battalions and one Frenchman.
5 I wish you were still working for me, so I could ask you to resign. How're ya fixed for cavalry?	I've gotta five thousand men but no horses.
6 That's funny, we've got five thousand horses but no men.	That's all right -- our men can ride your horses.
7 Not a bad idea.  If our horses get tired they can ride your men for a change.  Now, I don't mind letting you have our horses, but you must promise to put them through their maneuvers.	Oh, sure.  We have horse maneuvers every morning.

1 Are you sure you're not tired?	Tired!  I'd like to stretch this into a week -

1 What'll I do with this card?	You can keep it -- I've got a whole pack...  Now what were you saying?

1 My purse has been stolen -- the plans of war are in it.	WHAT  ?

1 This is all Firefly's fault -- that idiot, that fool...	I thought everything was working out fine.
2 Fine nothing!  I didn't want war... My plan was to marry Mrs. Teasdale and overthrow Firefly.	Maybe you can still win the old dame over -- why not try to --

1 Frederick, why are you so interested in this particular case?	I don't know. I can't explain it. If this is an intelligent man, trapped in the body of a monster, then I'm under a moral obligation to help free that mind, free that spirit as best I can, to help him live as full and content a life as possible. But! If he's an imbecile, who's body I can't treat and who's mind I can't touch, well, then my obligation is discharged. They can put him where they will; he won't be bothered, I won't be bothered, and everyone's conscience can remain free and untroubled. And that is my dilemma... what is in his mind?

1 What are you going to do?	I'll show you! I'll show you!

1 Don't be frightened. He won't hurt you.	Indeed!

1 Treves. Well done.	Not me, sir. Mr. Merrick. He succeeded in spite of my shortsightedness.

1 It was a great pleasure to meet you, Mr. Merrick.	I am very pleased to meet you.
2 I hope we can talk together again sometime. Good day.

1 Mr. Treves says that you are in the theatre. Do you live there?	Oh no, Mr. Merrick. I just work there.
2 Well, even to work there would be wonderful. Is it beautiful?	You've never been?
3 Alas, no.	Well you must go. It is one of the most beautiful places on earth. Of course, I'm rather partial.
4 Tell me about it, please!	It's very difficult to put into a nutshell, but I should say the theater is the shrine of the imagination, where one may suspend disbelief and travel anywhere in the world, to any time you desire. You may look over the shoulders of kings, unobserved, battle with ruthless tyrants, and marry the beautiful princess, all in the space of a few hours. Onstage you may be whoever you wish to be, do anything you please, and always, always live happily ever after. The theatre is all the brightest and best things of the world, Mr. Merrick. It is lights and music, gaiety and joy. It's... well, it's romance.
5 Romance!	That's one thing the theatre has in great store. which reminds me. I have something else for you...

1 Good morning, Mr. Merrick.	Good morning.

1 Mr. Merrick likes the food here. Don't you John?	Oh yes! It is much better than what I am used to.

1 Would you... would you like to see my mother?	Your mother?
2 Here.

1 Is it the one you wanted?	Oh, Mr. Treves. Mr. Treves.
2 Are you sure? Because I can take it back.	Mr. Treves. Thank you my... friends.

1 He's had his share of "smacks", Mothershead. I expect that's what drives him under the bed. We must use patience and understanding with this man.	Perhaps you've got the time for that, Mr. Treves, I certainly don't. I've got an entire hospital to look after, and you have your real patients. Don't waste your time with him sir, it's like talking to a wall. I don't mean to be harsh, but truthfully what can you do for him? I'll be back later for his bath. And Mr. Carr Gomm would like to see you when you have a moment. Good day sir.

1 So you'll bring him to me, tomorrow, 10:00 a.m.? Mr...?	Bytes. Mr. Bytes. He'll be there.
2 I'll send a cab. Here is my card.

1 How d'you KNOW we're "friends"?	Well, EVERYONE is friends here on Hy- Brasil.

1 No!	I'll bring it back.
2 Erik. You don't understand.	No. It's YOU who doesn't understand, Aud. Halfdan has come to kill and destroy. We brought him here. We must stop him.
3 But you don't realize....	Goodbye, Aud...

1 But --	It was my master Keitel's idea.

1 Would you like us to sing to you?	That's very kind of you, but we're in rather a hurry... We're...

1 It's all part of our safety regulations. You see if someone were to get hurt they might get angry and then... well...	They'll be more than "hurt" if Halfdan the Black lands! Ow!

1 I've come to take you back to the land of the living.	What a stupid idea.
2 Why?	What's the point of being dead in the land of the living?
3 I'll ask the Gods to give you life again!

1 How deep IS the ocean?	Very deep... usually...

1 I want to die...  No, I don't!	Row! Row! Row!

1 What did he say?	Look out!

1 A magic dishcloth.	To the oars!

1 And you, Keitel Blacksmith.	But...

1 Look, I bagged it last week.	It doesn't matter WHERE you sit!
2 Yes it does! We could be at sea for months.	Well, what difference does it make where you're SITTING?
3 I don't want to have to sit next to Snorri all that time.

1 What's all the panic about?	The Dragon...

1 Oh! Who cares? We're HOME!	Mum! Dad!

1 Wasn't it, Keitel?	Well... I... I thought...

1 It's a tradition.	I know, Dad.
2 I was a Berserk for King Harald Fairhair...	You went berserk...
3 I went berserk in every battle I ever fought for King Harald...	So did your father...
4 So did my father and his father before him.	But it's a responsibility...
5 But it's a responsibility being a Berserk.	I must only let the red rage...
6 You must only let the red rage take hold of you in the thick of battle.	I KNOW! I'VE HEARD IT ALL 1 THOUSAND TIMES!

1 Well I'M certainly not, either.	Neither am I.

1 I'm sorry Naomi couldn't make it. You okay? You seem quiet.	Just a little overworked, maybe.

1 Come over after I'm done here?	I can't. I want to, but I have to study.
2 You rat.	I really want to, but tonight's important. Test tomorrow.

1 I'm sorry.	Why?
2 Why what?	Why are you sorry? I just said hi.
3 No, I didn't know if you were talking to me, so...

1 So you like bookstores, huh?	I like to read.
2 Me too. It is Rain Dogs, by the way.	Yeah? I can't remember that album very well. I remember liking it. But --
3 The song's 9th and Hennepin. I spent most of the train ride trying to remember. "Till you're full of rag water and bitters and blue ruin/And you spill out/Over the side to anyone who'll listen." Remember?	Sort of, um...
4 Remember? "And you take on the dreams of the ones who have slept there/And I'm lost in the window/I hide on the stairway/I hang in the curtain/I sleep in your hat..."  Oh, shit. I'm so stupid. Sorry.	What?
5 I'm just a bit of a wreck. "I sleep in your hat" makes me cry.  Me.

1 Y'know, I'm sort of psychic.	Yeah?
2 Well, I go to a psychic and she's always telling me I'm psychic. She should know. Do you believe in that stuff?	I don't know.
3 Me neither. But sometimes I have premonitions, so, I don't know. Maybe that's just coincidence. Right? Y'know, you think something and then it happens, or you think a word and then someone says it? Y'know?	Yeah, I don't know. It's hard to know.
4 Exactly. Exactly! That's exactly my feeling about it. It's hard to know. Like, okay, but how many times do I think something and it doesn't happen? That's what you're saying, right? You forget about those times. Right?	Yeah, I guess.
5 But I think I am. I like to think I am.	It's helpful to think there's some order to things. You're kind of closed mouthed, aren't you?
6 Sorry. My life isn't that interesting. I go to work. I go home. I don't know what to say.	Oh.  Does that make you sad? Or anxious? I'm always anxious thinking I'm not living my life to the fullest, y'know? Taking advantage of every possibility? Just making sure that I'm not wasting one second of the little time I have.
7 I think about that.

1 A wino? Jesus, Are you from the fifties? A wino!  Face it, Joel. You're freaked out because I was out late without you, and in your little wormy brain, you're trying to figure out, did she fuck someone tonight?	No, see, Clem, I assume you fucked someone tonight. Isn't that how you get people to like you?

1 More?	No. Thanks.

1 Look at you, cutey! What are we doing?	This kid, Joe Early, is going to beat the shit out of me.

1 Joel, I'm not a concept. I want you to just keep that in your head. Too many guys think I'm a concept or I complete them or I'm going to make them alive, but I'm just a fucked-up girl who is looking for my own peace of mind. Don't assign me yours.	I remember that speech really well.
2 I had you pegged, didn't I?	You had the whole human race pegged.
3 Probably.	I still thought you were going to save me. Even after that.
4 I know.	It would be different, if we could just give it another go around.
5 Remember me. Try your best. Maybe we can.

1 I wish we did. You married?	Um, no.
2 Let's move into this neighborhood.

1 Don't worry. It's really solid this time of year.	I don't know.

1 Hi, it's Joel.	Hey, lover. Whatcha doing?
2 I'm just, y'know, passing the time best I can till I can see you.	God, I can't believe I ever hated you.
3 You must have been crazy.	Guess what I'm wearing.
4 I don't know. Panties and --	Your dried cum.
5 Jesus.

1 Clementine.	That's your look for me.

1 So you're still on the Zoloft?	Next thing I remember we were walking down near the surf.

1 Yeah. Come to bed. I'm cold.	In a minute.

1 Boo.	Hi.

1 I don't know what to do! I don't know what to do! Crap. Crap...	Well, what should we do?
2 I don't know! I just said that!	Sor-ry  We have to do something. He can't wake up half done.
3 Shit!

1 Howard, your one o'clock.	Thanks, Mary. You can bring her in.

1 Thanks.  So... do we talk about this... or what?	I don't know what I'm supposed say, Mary. I want to do the right thing here.
2 Do you love me? Did you love me? Something. I listened to my tape. I can't believe I've been sitting right in front of it for a year. It's like listening to someone else's story. I mean, I hear myself talking about having sex with you and I can't even imagine you naked. I can't even say "naked" to you!	I have a family, Mary.
3 You made me have an abortion.	It was a mutual decision.
4 You made me have you erased! I loved you. I love you! How could you --	I didn't make you. You thought it best.  But, look, I take full responsibility.

1 Oh, hi.	Hi, I was in the neighborhood and thought I'd see --
2 I think he's in a conference. Unfortunately. I'm really sorry.	Would you just try him? You never know. As long as I'm here. You never know.
3 Of course. Please have a seat.

1 I can handle it. He's pretty much on auto-pilot anyway.	Thanks, Stan. I owe you.

1 But that's an old story now...... I can't believe that you would leave the Butte.	Easy come, easy go.

1 Did that last comment sound too profound to be coming outta my mouth? It's not original. It's something I picked up from the Chink.	Really? The Chink, huh? I've gathered that you sometimes speak with him. What else have you learned from the Chink?
2 Learned from the Chink? Oh my. Ha ha. That's hard to say. We mostly.... Uh, a lot of his talk is pretty goofy.

1 What are you doing?	Getting dressed. I've got to go.
2 But I don't want you to leave. Please stay. We can go to dinner. I owe you a dinner. And tonight... we can... really make love.	I have to go, Julian.
3 Why? Why do you have to go?	My thumbs hurt. I've made a mistake. I've been negligent. I haven't exercised. I have to hitchhike a little bit every day, no matter what. It's like a musician practicing his scales. When I don't practice, my timing gets off, my thumbs get stiff and sore.

1 But here you are, still a virgin -- you are virginal yet, aren't you?	Why, yes, technically. Jack Kerouac and I came awfully close, but he was afraid of me, I think...
2 Yes, well, what I'm getting at is that there comes a time when it is psychologically impossible for a woman to lose her virginity. She can't wait too long, you know. Now, there's no reason why you must lose yours. I mean, just ponder it a bit, that's all.	What makes you think this watercolorist and I would develop a romantic relationship?
3 I can't be certain that you would. But what have you got to lose?	Well, okay. I'll try it. I don't see the point in it, but I'll try it. Just for you. It's kind of silly, actually, me going out with an artist in New York City. However...
4 Good, good, good... you'll enjoy it, you'll see. Julian is a gentleman.

1 ...cancel our leave and send us out on some bullshit mission...!	EVERYBODY SHUT UP! Let the man speak.

1 Solid as a rock.  Hey, Smith...	Smith, clear that airlock, man, I'm coming in.
2 Roger that.

1 What...?	Run!

1 They thought it said, "Liberatis me," "Save me," but it's not "me." It's "tutemet:" "Save yourself."	It's not a distress call. It's a warning.
2 It gets worse.

1 Incredible... These are the same coordinates before the ship disappeared... this, this happened? This isn't some kind of hoax?	I wouldn't bring you here on a hoax. Houston confirms the telemetry and I.D. codes.
2 It's the Event Horizon. She's come back.

1 You've reached the First Containment Seal. The engineering decks are on the other side.	We still have pressure. The radiation count's steady at 7 millirads an hour.
2 Background radiation. Perfectly safe.

1 What's the hold up?	Just loading the last of the CO2 scrubbers.  Good for four months.
2 I put in for a replacement for you but no one...	No, no, its alright. I talked to my ex, he'll keep Denny over Christmas and I'll get him this summer.  Goddam it, Skipper... I haven't seen him in two months.
3 I am sorry. But now we have to go to work.

1 Justin, check the containment for radiation leaks. Peters...	...how's the client?
2 Crystallized.

1 That's the engineering containment. And there's the main airlock. We can dock there.	Smith, use the arm and lock us onto that antennae cluster.
2 Be careful. It's not a load bearing structure...

1 It's insane.	"Insane?" The finest astronauts fought to be posted to this ship. It would take the Lewis and Clark a thousand years to reach our closest star. The Event Horizon could be there in a day...
2 If it worked.	If it worked, yes.

1 We're leaving.	You can't, your orders are specific...
2 "...to rescue the crew and salvage the ship." The crew is dead, Dr. Weir. This ship killed them. And now it's killing us.	You're insane. You've lost your mind.
3 Maybe you're right. But it's still my command, and I have leeway to abort when I feel there is an unacceptable threat to my crew. And I think there is.  Starck, download all the files from the Event Horizon's computers. Coop, Smith, finish moving the CO2 scrubbers back onto the Clark.	Don't... don't do this...
4 It's done.

1 I don't like it either, but you know the rules: we get the call, we go. Is the course locked in?	Locked and cocked.

1 It is now.  We're locked in.	Starck, give me a read.

1 Get off the Clark now and wait for me at the airlock.	No, no, we just got her back together...
2 Get out of there now!

1 The antennae array's completely fried, we've got no radio, no laser, no highgain... No one's going to be coming to help us.	How much oh-two do we have?
2 Oxygen is not the problem.	Carbon dioxide?
3 It's building up with every breath we take. And the CO2 filters on the Event Horizon are shot.	We can take the filters from the Clark...
4 I thought of that, with the filters from the Clark, we've got enough breathable air for twenty hours. After that, we'd better be on our way home.	What about the life readings you picked up?
5 The Event Horizon sensors show the same thing: "Bio-readings of indeterminate origin." Right before that wave hit the Clark, there was some kind of surge, right off the scale, but now it's back to its previous levels.	What's causing the readings?
6 I don't know, but whatever it is, it's not the crew.	So where is the rest of the crew? We've been over every inch of this ship and all we've found is blood. Dr. Weir? Any suggestions?

1 What?	He's awake, he's in the airlock, he's not wearing a suit.
2 Stay here! Don't stop working!

1 Don't worry about it. He's hard, but he's fair. You're lucky to be shipping out with him. He's one of the few Captains in the service with experience in the Outer Reach.	He's been past Mars?
2 He served on the Goliath.	Wasn't that ship destroyed?
3 They attempted to rescue a supply shuttle bound for Titan. The shuttle's oh-two tanks ruptured during the rescue, flooded both ships with pure oxygen. There was a spark and both ships were incinerated. The Skipper and three others just made it to a lifeboat. Captain Miller was able...

1 Almost got it.	Come on, Baby-bear, open this door...

1 I didn't see anything and I don't have to see anything. This ship is fucked.	Thank you for that scientific analysis, Mister Smith.
2 Hey! You don't need to be a scientist figure it out...

1 What if the air has gone bad? We can't wear these suits forever.	I don't think this is a good idea, we don't even know what happened on that ship...

1 What are you doing?	It wants me. I have to go.

1 You know, you could'a run an ad in the personals.	"Sensual blind chick seeks three- ton, rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship."
2 This ain't permanent. My friend Reed's working on a cure... I think.

1 Where is Reed?	Victor must've taken him.

1 Oh my G-g-g. What did you... do to Ben?	Deb, it's me. It's still me.

1 Isn't that your speech?	He's made a few changes.
2 This is your dream, Reed. You should be the one up there.	Victor's better at these things.

1 You got a chisel round here?	If we're going to identify the source of the mutation, we need to isolate your recombinant DNA so we can activate positional genomes.

1 Where... where am I?	Back on Earth. Victor's medical facility... We're in quarantine.
2 Reed?... Sue?	They're fine. Everybody else... is fine.

1 You're hot!	So are you!
2 I mean, you feel a little feverish.	I've never felt better in my life. When do you get off work?
3 My shift ends at four, but I couldn't --	Meet me at 4:01, top of the run. That'll give you a minute to freshen up.

1 We should stay here until we can define the extent of our changes...	This place is deluxe. You got cable?
2 ...and figure out how to reverse them. Let me show you to your rooms.

1 Flame on, flame off. Flame on, flame off --	Johnny.

1 Johnny, slow down. Think. You know mom didn't raise us to --	Look around, sis! She's not here. So you can stop talking to me like I'm your little boy --
2 As soon as you stop acting like one. Come on, you're smarter than this. You think those people out there care about you? You're just a fad to them.

1 Sir, I've always wondered... Why Sue? You could have any woman in the world but --	That's why. Because I could have any other woman... You know, when they asked Caesar "why England," he said, "because it's not mine."

1 For science.	You are such a dork, Reed... You never got it and never will unless it's explained to you in quantum physics.

1 I mean, you broke up with me, right?	Are you kidding?
2 No, I distinctly remember: you walked out my door. Ergo...

1 Remember our first date here...? God, I was so nervous.	You were?
2 Of course I was. I'd read all your papers on bioethics. Some of them two times just so I'd have something to say to you.

1 Funny how things turn out, isn't it?	Hilarious.

1 It's just business.	I think you both know my Director of Genetic Research, Susan Storm.

1 If these molecules aren't stable, they could make us worse, maybe even kill us.	Then why is Reed dragging his feet? Maybe he likes having his prize specimen under glass...  It's ironic, isn't it? You're finally the perfect woman for him... because you're his science project.

1 Something happened to them, mon.	Come on, Spicoli. Why don't you just put your shirts back on? See the sign?

1 Everyone wants to know where Lisa is. How should I know where Lisa is?  What am I gonna do? Now my little sister goes to the same high school. The party's over.  So who do you have first period?	U.S. History. Mr. Hand.
2 Hey-yo.

1 You're not going to tell me, are you?	No.
2 All right, then. It's your secret.

1 Well, that's exactly why I brought some Wisk for the jacuzzi.	O-kay, you guys can come swimming. But you have to leave as soon as my Mom gets home. Okay?

1 Why don't you take off your clothes, Mike?	You first.
2 How about both of us at the same time?

1 Mike! You have a mess on C-9!	All right. All right. I just cleaned B-8. Give me a break.
2 Get going.

1 Yo.	Damone. It's Mark.
2 Mark. What happened to your date?	It's happening right now. I'm here at the Atlantis. Everything's fine except... I left my wallet at home.
3 Did you go home and get it?	No. It's too late. The food is coming and everything. Damone, I've got to ask you this favor, and I'll never ask you for anything again in this lifetime or any other. Will you please borrow your mom's car, go by my house, get my wallet, and meet me back here?

1 Are you Linda Barrett?	Yes.
2 I'm Carrie Frazier from Toys 'R Us. Judy Hinton from May Company told me I could ask you something.

1 Seen the new Playboy?	Naw. Any good?
2 Suzanne Somers' tits.	All right.
3 I like sex.

1 Face it. With some guys you have to make the first move. A lot of guys are just... wussies.	Really?
2 Stacy, what are you waiting for? You're fifteen. I did it when I was thirteen. It's no huge thing. It's just sex. If you don't, one of the other girls will.	He was hot, wasn't he?
3 If I didn't have a fianc in Chicago, I'd go for it.

1 Don't you think it meant anything to him. Even if I am fifteen?	Stacy. What does it matter? He's a stereo salesman. You want to marry him? You want to have kids with him? You want this guy to come home, fifty years old, and he's still got that little Pacific Stereo badge on? Come on.

1 God, Stacy, it's not that sad. It's just David Soul and Ricardo Montalban.	I don't know, I'm just so depressed. Everything is just so... depressing.

1 You just ripped my card in two!	Yes.
2 Hey, bud. What's your problem?

1 Aloha, Mr. Hand!	Aloha, Spicoli.

1 What do you do with the jackets people leave here?	We keep them.
2 You keep them.	We keep them, in case the people come back.

1 Sure. I'll... have another Coke.	Two more Cokes.

1 Hi, Mark.	Hi, Stacy. How are you?
2 I'm fine. Mark, I'm so glad you came over here because I want you to know something. I just thought I would tell you that I really enjoyed getting to know you this year.

1 But he will be available? Perhaps later this morning?	Look. That telegram was all scrambled. It was actually from Thompson, not to him. Western Union must have gotten the names reversed. I have to get going. I have to get out to the track.
2 There's no hurry! The race is over!	Not for me.

1 Naked!?	Naked.

1 Thanks for the ride. Thanks a lot. I like you guys. Don't worry about me.	Wait a minute! Come back and have a beer!

1 Turn up the fucking music! My heart feels like an alligator! Volume! Clarity! Bass! We must have bass! What's wrong with us? Are you goddamn old ladies?	You scurvy shyster bastard! Watch your language! You're talking to a Doctor of Journalism!
2 What the fuck are we doing out here? Somebody call the police! We need help!	Pay no attention to this swine. He can't handle the medicine. 
3 The truth is we're going to Vegas to croak a scag baron named Savage Henry. I've known him for years but he ripped us off -- and you know what that means, right?

1 That's good...	I think he's lying to us. I could see it in his eyes.
2 They'll probably have a big net for us when we show up.

1 Don't run. They'd like any excuse to shoot us.	You drive! I think there's something wrong with me.

1 Fuck yes. I was beginning to think I was going to have to go out and get one of the goddamn maids to do it.	Are you ready?

1 I gave the cabbie an extra ten bucks to make sure she gets there safe. Also, I told him I'd be there myself in an hour, and if she wasn't, I'd come back out here and rip his lungs out.	That's good. You can't be subtle in this town.
2 As your attorney, I advise you to tell me where you put the goddamn mescaline.	Maybe we should take it easy tonight.
3 Right. Let's find a good seafood restaurant and eat some red salmon. I feel a powerful lust for red salmon...

1 OK, goddamnit!... Look... I'll call her. I'll get her off our backs. You're right. She's my problem.	It's gone too far.
2 Relax. Let me handle this.  You'd make a piss-poor lawyer... Room 1600, please.  As your attorney, I advise you not to worry.  Take a hit out of that little brown bottle in my shaving kit.

1 There was nothing in the atmosphere of the North Star to put me on my guard...	Two glasses of ice water with ice.

1 You'd pay me for that?	You're damn right. But the first time you say anything about this, to anybody -- you'll go straight to prison for the rest of your life. What's your name?
2 Alice. Just ring Linen Service and ask for Alice.

1 What?	One phone call every day. Just tell us what you've seen. Don't worry if it doesn't add up, that's our problem.

1 Are you two all right? Did you see that!? They left! We made it! I think we made it!	They'll be back.
2 Oh, come on! Can't you be happy for one split second? They're gone!

1 One keg of Beast for the basement, then, truck's dry.	Gonna stay for a couple?

1 We'll be food, dickheads!	Well, your last words can be "I told you so."
2 You gotta be with me on this.

1 Where's the tunnel?	In the corner, behind the curtain.

1 Any more ideas Animal Planet?	You weren't helpin'.
2 Go douche.

1 All right!  Tell us about the truck!	Uh, uh, I think if we can get everyone into it... we can get out of here.

1 You wanna see, baby?	Sure.
2 How much you got?	How much I got, what?

1 What's that!? Wha'cha say? Huh?	Get outta here.

1 Blow the goddamn hatch!	Clear!

1 SHIT.	MOVE YOUR ASS!

1 Hey!	Everyone take a role. Let's prepare the guns, ammo and whatever else we can scare up. We also need to help the hurt so we can move them on our ultimate exit outta here.  So, who's going into the basement with me?

1 Okay, well that's something.	So we've got guns, kitchen knives, pipes, fire and sticks.

1 Shut up! Shut your mouth. You have no idea what is running through me right now. No idea.  I'm ready.	All right.

1 And on top of her political activities, now she's got a lawyer. She wants out of her contract, Mr. Bebe. She says she's through with motion pictures.	I'm sure it wasn't me, it wasn't me...
2 Excuse me, sir?	I don't know who she fucked to get where she is, but I don't think it was me.

1 That's not all, Frances. Mr. Bebe is very concerned about your politics. He hears you've been donating money, speaking at rallies.	Yup. Claire... please, please tell Mr. Bebe that if he worried half as much about his scripts as he does about my private life, we'd make a lot better movies.
2 I'm sorry, Frances. It's my job, you know?	I know.  'This is a factory and we each have our jobs. The writer writes, the director directs, and the actress...'
3 ...acts. I'll relay your message.

1 You don't think I'm good enough?	What?! Good Lord no, it's just... It's money. We needed backing and... well, we found it.
2 Who?	An actress.
3 A rich actress.	Yes. That's the deal. She plays Lorna.
4 But... but wait a minute. We're supposed to be different, right? Clifford says... This theatre is supposed to be different! And this play... this play is all about what greed and money do to people!	I know, but --
5 What does Clifford say?	Right now we have to be practical.
6 Does Clifford even know?  You didn't tell him, did you?  I'm gonna tell him. Where is he?	He knows, Frances.

1 No. Cut this runaround, Doctor. I know better.	Listen to yourself, Frances. The resistance, the anger in your voice.
2 You... I'm sorry, forgive me. Doctor, tell me honestly, what do I have to do to get out of here?	Be patient, that's all. Take an interest in your treatment and don't dwell on your resentments. You'll be yourself again, I assure you.
3 ...I see.	We'll talk more about this. I'll see you later.
4 One question. If I'm not myself now, just who do you think I am?

1 What do I do, Dad?	You really want to go?
2 Of course.	And you think it's worth all this?
3 If I didn't, I wouldn't put you through it.	...Then go.

1 You're poisoning that child's mind.	I have a right to talk to her. She's my daughter, and she's beginning to understand why I've sacrificed so much in order to achieve...
2 You've sacrificed?! If you'd practice law for decent folk instead of Communists and indigents --	They need help, Lil. They pay me back in other ways.
3 How? What do they do for you, Kaminski and his friends? They're all anarchists! Traitors!	No, Lil. It's just you can't understand their brand of patriotism.
4 That's right. I can't understand a man who puts strangers over his family, a man who gives up a good career to become a shiftless inkhorn failure.

1 Just one minute...	You're wasting your time, lady. Nothing's off the record with me.

1 How ya doin', Farmer?	Me? Look at you! What're you doing in Hollywood?
2 Came to get a tan.

1 Harry? Harry, where are you?!	Jesus, Frances, how'd you find me?
2 I called your god-damned office! I want you to kill him, Harry. You'll do that for me, won't you? I loved him, I loved him... that bastard.	Calm down, Frances.
3 Don't tell me what to do, just give me his head on a platter!

1 Where are we, mean man?	Couple hours from Idaho. We'll cut across to Montana. I've got friends there with a ranch.
2 I should've known...	What?
3 This is another one of your schemes to get me off alone...	That's right.
4 ...Take advantage of me.

1 I love you, Harry. I love you.	I love you too, Frances.

1 Where you goin'?	Wherever they're going, I'm going.
2 Yeah, I know what that's like... Where you been?	Well, I was picking fruit with some migrant workers until...

1 'But how do I know you love me?'	Your big speech?
2 'How do I know it's true? You'll get to be the champ. They'll all want you, all the girls! But I don't care. I've been undersea a long time. When they'd put their hands on me I used to say, "This isn't it! This isn't what I mean!" It's been a mysterious world for me! But Joe, I think you're it! I don't know why, I think you're it. Take me home with you.'	I already have.

1 And here's one from nice Mr. Zeiss. He says that...	Why are these all opened?
2 Well, they needed immediate answers, Frances. It's good manners and good sense. You shouldn't be bothering yourself with these right now.	Then why did you bring them?
3 It's your fan mail, little sister.	You kill me, Mama.
4 What?	Go on...

1 Haven't you heard what I said?	I told him to come up! I told him you wanted to show them all that there's nothing wrong with you any more, that you're completely cured!
2 I'm not cured. I was never sick! They had no business putting me in there! My only responsibility is to myself now!	You... you selfish, selfish child. At least talk to him, hear what he has to say.
3 No!	You want to throw it all away, is that it? You had everything, little sister. Beauty... a brilliant career... a wonderful husband. You were a movie star!
4 Mama, shut up!	And now you're throwing everything away? You're gonna be a nobody! Nobody! You know what that's like?!
5 You... You'd send me back, wouldn't you? You would.

1 Oh! Are you really?	Among persons such as yourself, creative people under great stress, erratic behavior is not at all uncommon and certainly nothing to be ashamed of. It's just that the neuroses which fuel your talent can also generate certain character disabilities which... 

1 I don't know why they even bother. She's had enough of this to knock sense into a bull elephant.	Yeah?
2 I checked the files. This one holds the record for shock treatments. Four hundred seventeen and no end in sight.	You're kidding.
3 Yeah, well, you know doctors. They sure hate to use that word.	What?
4 'Incurable.'

1 Why, Victor? Why? What were you thinking?	There was something at work in my soul which I do not understand.
2 What of my soul? Do I have one? Or was that a part you left out?  Who were these people of which I am comprised? Good people? Bad people?	Materials. Nothing more.
3 You're wrong. Do you know I knew how to play this?

1 That's the nature of all progress, William. Don't let your brother sway you otherwise.	Quite right!

1 Are you sure it can't hurt us?	Nothing can. Not ever.

1 You make me weak.	Not as weak as I.

1 It's going to ram us.	It wouldn't dare.

1 Rich old ladies and their daughters?	Can you think of a better reason?
2 Quite a few.	Do me a favor then...  ...keep them to yourself.

1 Thank God your fever broke.  Slowly, now. Just a sip.  I've been worried we might lose you. It's been touch-and-go for a week.	A... week?
2 We feared cholera. Turned out to be pneumonia, brought on by nervous exhaustion and some idiot running around in a storm.	Is that your diagnosis?
3 Mine and Professor Krempe's.  We've been trading off nursing you in shifts. The rest of the time we're out working with the cholera victims. It's his turn for that just now.	You've been going round-the-clock?
4 We catch a few hours sleep where we can. Usually here at your bedside.	Everything in moderation, Clerval.
5 Nothing in moderation, Frankenstein.

1 You seem to be adapting well to the approved curriculum.	Despite the lack of challenge.

1 Do you share my madness?	Madness?

1 I think we should go wake them up. Just in case.	Give them a little while longer. It's still early, anyway.
2 I guess...

1 You think you're gonna last all summer?	I'm not sure I'll last all week.  I'll tell Steve.

1 How the... did he get in there?	Slipped in. Probably liked the scent of your perfume.

1 What's the matter with it?	Wet. I don't know.

1 Somebody's there, Barry.	Come on, Claudette. A man's not made of stone.
2 Let's go back, Barry...	I need you so much, Claudette.

1 You just had some lucky shots.	Where's Ned?

1 Jack?	Coach, athletic director somewhere.

1 Are you wet?	Just a little. Wait a minute, woman.

1 I have six new counsellor up there. They're all babes in the woods in every sense of the word.	They'll be okay if they know enough to stay in outta the rain.
2 How much do I owe you?	One night on the town.
3 I mean...	...I know what you mean. Two and a quarter. Plus fifteen percent tip to make up for me spending the night alone.

1 Oh, Seth, how can I ever make it up to you?	You can't, but fifteen percent instead of thirty for my stay at El Ray is a good start.
2 Twenty-eight.	Jesus Christ, Carlos, my brother's dead and he's not coming back, and it's all your fault. Twenty.

1 Why did they block the door again?	To keep the daylight out! This is where they sleep! Get to the door!

1 If he touches her, I'll kill him. I don't give a fuck how many guns you have, nothing will stop me from killing him.	Fair enough. You break your word, I'll kill all of you.  Kate, honey!

1 Now, is your shit together?	Forever together.

1 Dad, when I called the machine to check our messages there was one from Bethel Baptist. Mr. Franklin said he wouldn't permanently replace you until we came back. He said when we come home, if you still feel the same way --	That's very nice of Ted, but I'll call him tomorrow and tell him not to bother waiting.
2 I didn't want to talk about this in front of Scott because he gets upset. But you don't believe in God anymore?	Not enough to be a pastor. Look, I know this is hard on you kids. After Jenny's death, this is probably the last thing you need. But I can't do it any longer. My congregation needs spiritual leadership. Well, they can't get that from me anymore. My faith is gone. To answer your question, yes, I do believe in Jesus. But do I love them? No. After Jenny died, I just thought, what's the point?
3 It's just, all our lives you've been a pastor. For twenty years you've preached trust in the lord. And then one day you wake up and say fuck him?	I didn't say fuck him. I'm just not connected anymore.
4 That happens, you'll get it back.	Kate, give your old man a little credit. Every person who chooses the service of God as their life's work has something in common. I don't care if you're a preacher, a priest, a nun, a rabbi or a Buddhist monk. Many, many times during your life you'll look at your reflection in the mirror and ask yourself, am I a fool? We've all done it. I'm not going through a lapse. What I've experienced is closer to awakening. I'm not trying to shake your faith. I've just decided not to devote my life to God anymore.
5 What do you think Mom would say?	Mom's got nothing to say, she's dead.

1 What?	Where are you taking us?
2 Mexico.	What's in Mexico?
3 Mexicans.

1 How many bullets left, kid?	Not many.
2 Well, when you run out of weapons, just start cold cocking 'em. Make 'em sing for their supper.

1 What do you want from me? I did what you said.	Letting him use your toilet? No store does that.
2 He comes in here every day and we bullshit. He's used my toilet a thousand times. If I told him no, he'd know something was up.	I want that son-of-a-bitch out outta here, in his car, and down the road or you can change the name of this place to "Benny's World of Blood."

1 Yeah?	When I count three, shoot out the bottles behind him!
2 Gotcha!	One... Two... Three.

1 What'd ya mean, what? The fuckin' woman, the hostage. Where the fuck is she, Richard!?	She's in the other room.
2 What the fuck is she doin' there?!

1 Far out.  Where are my glasses?	They broke when you fell.
2 Oh, fuck, Seth, that's my only pair!	Don't worry about it, we'll get you some glasses.
3 What dya mean, don't worry about it. Of course I'm gonna worry about it, I can't fuckin' see.	When we get to El Ray, I'll take care of it.
4 Yeah, like a Mexican hole-in-the- wall's gonna have my fuckin' prescription.	It's not a big deal, unless you make it a big deal. Now, I'm real happy, Richie, stop bringing me down with bullshit.

1 They take you away to San Clemente Island.  Half the guys quit when they come back.  Supposed to be just hell-and-a-half.	That's what I hear.
2 Can I ask you somethin', lieutenant? How come you're doing this?  I mean, we're kinda curious.	Who's "we"?
3 Just some of the women.

1 Sir, I just want you to know... I'm not here to make a statement.  I don't want to make men look foolish. All I care about is completing the training and getting operational experience -- just like everyone else, I suspect.	If you were like everyone else, lieutenant, I suspect we wouldn't be making statements about not making statements, would we?  Take your leave.

1 I'm saying, we're just friends.	I find this as distasteful as you, lieutenant.  But if it's on my desk, it's on my shoulders.  There's going to be an inquiry -- it will not be quick and it will definitely not be pretty.  You should prepare yourself.
2 Sir, please... if there's any way to do this without dragging everyone through the mud...	I don't see how, O'Neil.  Dismissed.

1 White House boys want a private meeting.	I'll act surprised.

1 Jordan.  I always hoped we'd get together -- though just now I'm gearing up for a child-care vote that --	Lieutenant Thomas Wickwire.

1 Really don't wanna be captured, el- tee.  Heard some bad things.	Fuck.  Basher-Basher, this is Ground Crew Six requesting emergency extraction. Stand by for a PRC fix...

1 Thank you, sir.  But I like these just fine.	Not doin' them very fine, O'Neil.
2 I'll try anyway, sir.	You'll try what we tell you to try, O'Neil.  Go regulation.

1 Well, you're doin' shit-hot at Intel.	Royce.  We're the same age, we started the same time -- and now you're sitting in the upperdecks while I'm still down in the bullpen. What does that tell you about the Navy?
2 She's haze grey and underway...	You need operational duty to really advance... you need combat training to go operational... yet combat training is off-limits to people with tits.  I'm topped out at Intel. Forget the glass ceiling -- I'm beating my head on a big brass ceiling.
3 So dump on me.	This has nothing to do with you.
4 Well, guess I don't even need to be here...	Get your dick back here.  It has everything to do with you.
5 You're such a ball-breaker sometimes.  Especially at night.	Sorry.  But after our days...  So if I try this thing... if I ship out to Coronado... what happens here?
6 I'll try to keep the door open.  If you wash out, I make it so that --	Wai', wait.  What happens if it works?  Four months of training, three years of operational duty. What then?
7 I don't feel like doing an option paper on the rest of my life, Jordan.  Maybe we should just let it happen.	Which is guy-speak for...
8 Sounded lame as soon as it came out of my mouth.  But I'm trying to be honest, okay?  Three years is a long time.  Don't ask me to predict how I'll feel then, Jordan, because I don't know.  And either do you.	You know, right up until you said that -- I thought I did know.

1 "Wickwire, Thomas Dane"... Second run at Coronado... and correct, they had him stashed in the "Appropriation Liaison Office," whatever that is.	You don't crap out of Spec-Recon and get another shot without dispensation from someone up in flag country.  He's got a Sea Daddy somewhere.
2 I'd sure like to know who.	Yeah.  Me too.

1 I'm sorry, O'Neil.  But as class officer, it's my obligation to report all violations.	This is insane.  You've got no proof.

1 Females in combat situations impact unit cohesion.  Men fight better without women around.  And that is an historical fact.	It also seems like a problem with the men's attitude, sir.  So maybe you should be sniffing around their shower room instead.

1 O'Neil...	Shut up, sir.  I'm concentrating.

1 Can't live with them, can't kill them.  What's the point?	Somebody throw a tent over this circus.

1 I like that image.	You know how I spent last weekend? Walking his damned dog.

1 What are you doing?	Lucy'd kill me if she knew.

1 So you made it.	What?

1 Circuits are overloaded.	I know a way. I know how you can get a message out of here.

1 Did Romeo have a name?	Nick Tatopoulos.

1 Hi. Nick Tatopoulos...	Ah, Elsie Chapman, paleontologist.

1 When we learned he could burrow his way through the tunnels we realized he could be out of the quarantined zone.	Christ. How many tunnels lead off the island?
2 Only five, Sir. We've checked them all. He hasn't used any of them.	Have them sealed off.
3 And how should we do that, Sir?	Fill them with cement, brick them up, put land mines in them, bombs, I don't know, just make sure that goddamned thing doesn't leave the island!

1 Somebody must have seen it.	It happened so fast no one knew what hit them 'til is was over.

1 Are you looking for this?	Thanks.

1 I think we should leave now.	Good idea.

1 Sir, it's you  Thank Ipthar!	Quellek. What are you doing in there?
2 I avoided capture using the Mak'tar stealth haze.  Where is everyone?	Come with me. I'll explain on the way.

1 At ease men.	Like throwing gasoline on a fire...

1 "Purple skinned monstrosity...?"	I was staying in character.  "Egomaniacal sonofabitch?"
2 Sense memory. I see you got to win the fight...	I had the shot...

1 You were holding it upside down weren't you?	Shut up.
2 You know, with the makeup and everything1 I actually thought he was smart for a second.	You think you could do better "Laredo?"
3 Hey, watch that "Laredo" shit.

1 WE'VE HAVE TO STOP!	FRONT ARMOR IS GONE! JUST SLOW IT DOWN A LITTLE!

1 Commander, please settle a dispute that my crew and I are having. In "The Quasar Dilemma", the Sentient had taken control of the ship's guidance systems, however-	Excuse me guys.

1 No, wait, are you-	Lt. Madison, GO.
2 Shit! Go!	GO Commander.

1 Systems register functional.	All systems are working, Commander.

1 You Okay, Alex?	I don't like this... I don't like this at all...

1 I am SO SICK of being right.	Let's get out of here before one of those things kills guy.

1 Hi everybody.	Hey. Thanks for one nice intro... uh.
2 Guy... You probably don't remember me do you?   I was on the show in '82.  Episode 31?  Got killed by the lava monster before the first commercial?  "Crewman #6?"

1 It's Jason...	One minute   I'm -  Hey, I'm dressing.'
2 Oh come on, it's not like I haven't-

1 Can it be repaired?	Computer, can it be repaired?

1 Wait, the pig lizard is gone. Why are they still chanting for the pig lizard?	Turn on the translation circuit.

1 You gotta admit, they do love him.	Almost as much as he loves himself.

1 Yes... Hi Sarris... How are you doing?	Better than my Lieutenant.  He failed to activate ship's neutron armor as quickly as I'd hoped on our last encounter.

1 Commander... Welcome to the Protector II.  Would you like to don your uniform?	Mind If we skip that?  I have to get back pretty quick for this thing in Van Nuys.
2 As you wish.

1 A thousand apologies. We have failed you.	You what?.. What are you talking about?
2 We have seen you victorious in many more desperate situations. The fault must lie with us, with the ship...

1 Where?	Just GO! GO! DAMMIT PUNCH GO!

1 All right guys... Uh... Gwen and I are going to have to get to the core and shut it down manually. Fred, you and Guy need to get that air valve back on.  Alex, see if you can get the prison doors open downstairs in case Fred and Guy can't get the oxygen back in time.	Jason? What about me? What do I do?
2 Practice driving, Tommy.

1 Well, now there's something worth dying for.  What do you think?	Hmmm... she's beneath me, I'm afraid.
2 I wish she was beneath me.

1 What do you think, George, shall I resign?  It's what they want.	Don't do anything rash, please, Benedict.

1 These men were taken from their homes at night, tried by Reed's courts -- which Congress recognizes -- and, well, you can see.	Cut those men down.  Congress is pushing ahead with your court-martial.  Benedict, trust me to handle this.

1 General Lee, welcome back.  I'm happy you've decided to join us.	More than that, sir... my orders from Congress.

1 They're among the best divisions the British have.  No conscripts, no impressed recruits, just professional killers.	It's a wonder they find the British cause worth dying for.

1 George, remember that night when we were drinking with Arnold?	To hell with Arnold...
2 He warned you some day you might have to act for the good of the people -- even if it was against Congress.  George, the time has come for you to declare yourself king of America.  Listen to me, the whole army would rise up as one and place you on a throne!  George, you must declare yourself with us or against us.	Is this a coup?  Alexander, are you trying to tell me that I might be assassinated if I don't agree?

1 If he supports the British why is it that every time he gets near them he kills so many of them?  Unlike General Lee... who you and Congress backed for second in command and who is a goddamned incompetent!	Lafayette is a child!
2 Lafayette is my friend!  He believes in glory and truth and the freedom of all mankind; so, of course he's a child.  But he would have died before he would have let me down.

1 Congress is bitterly opposed to allowing Negroes in the army!	We already have black soldiers in our army...
2 Unofficially, General Greene.	What's the difference?

1 Arnold is indispensable, do you understand?  I need Arnold to help me win this war!	Well, I shall deny him to you!  He is evil on earth!
2 Are you all going insane!? Benedict Arnold!  The man who stopped the British on Lake Champlain!  Who carried the day at Saratoga!  Goddamn-it, Joseph, you own two mansions, ride in an expensive, Tory coach!  You are all nothing but a pack of greedy pigs!

1 My God!  Who ordered this retreat?!	General Lee, sir!
2 Get these men back in line!

1 Martha... what?	Virginia is outraged with your order allowing Negroes to fight in the army.  There's a deep feeling of hurt and betrayal.  They wanted you commander because they expected you would look out for our interests.
2 To win this war I need an army.	Oh, indeed?  You know very well people are frightened of arming the Negroes!  They beg you to consider the future.  What good is a revolution if it overturns those things we cherish!?
3 What's the point of a revolution if it doesn't?	Some things must never change.
4 Is that why you come in here tossing pennies to my starving men? It's damned condescending!	Don't condescend to me!  We have both of us prospered from the arrangements of our kind...
5 Our 'kind'?  What is that supposed to mean?  These men are all I have left and they stay because they will fight!  They desire it!  They seek it!  Of course Virginia is terrified!  For my soldiers this is a war to obliterate the 'upper class' from the face of the earth! Should I tell them all to go home because if they win it will ruin me!?  It is impossible for me to imagine that Negroes are fighting so that only white men may be free! If we win this war they will own this country too!

1 They're just disgusting, jealous, bottom-feeding swine.  It's their nature.	You have a free tongue, Captain Hamilton.

1 You remember, George, when we were 'studying' the great philosophers?	I remember a pair of young philosophers once, who laughed at the world.
2 Well, I remember a philosopher who said something that I used to think was just another of those stupid class denouncements... but which I now see means us all.	Really?  Which precious homily was it?
3 "Mankind is born free, but everywhere he is in chains..."

1 Do you?  When I saw those men yesterday in the field... and the women and children in those hovels? I'm not so sure if America is as far from England as I'd hoped.	It's the freest land on earth.
2 Is it?  Well, I'm scared of what we've become in our freedom.	Well, we must be who we must be...

1 The land here is best for grain and corn.	Though, sometimes we get frost and that can cut the season.

1 Listen, tonight, later on, I got one for you doesn't involve any heavy work. I want you to go have a look around Chili Palmer's hotel room.	I can't. I got to take Farrah to Satan's place down in Costa Mesa.
2 Who?	Her mother. Not that it matters because I don't work for you no more. I quit. I just wanted to come by, tell you to your face so there's no misunderstanding.
3 Whoa... This is the man used to jump offa high buildings?	Into air bags. There's no cushion under what you're doing. I'm out of it, Cat. I'm done.
4 Bear. The Colombians are in L.A. Seems they all upset about their money. That ain't enough, as a bonus, it turns out the yoyo was Escobar's nephew.	That's your problem. You shouldn't've smoked the guy.

1 I don't know how I could've missed you with that shirt on. It's the same as the other one you had only the hibiscus are a different color. Right?	So you didn't have the key with you.
2 You think I'd be standing here? You set somebody up and you want it to work, it has to be a surprise. Can you remember that?	You spotted them, huh?

1 But first I want to know who I'm talking to. Am I talking to you, or am I talking to him?	You can talk to me.
2 That's what I thought. So let me put it this way...

1 I can't believe the way you guys do business out here. I can't believe how fucked up your organization is.	Tell you what...

1 Bo. I'm great. Listen, I'm expecting some people -	You must be makin' some big deals, doin' lunch in a place like this?
2 I'm working on a few things.	Yeah, I hear you bagged Martin Weir for Mr. Lovejoy.
3 Boy, this town. Word gets around, doesn't it?

1 You get to town, you go straight to the bank, raid the limo account.	I'm already in town, but it don't matter. We got dick in the bank. We dumped it all in Harry's movie.
2 What I'm sayin' is the man wants his money and he wants it now.

1 Who the fuck are you?	Ray Barboni. From Miami.
2 What, like that's supposed to mean something to me?

1 Did you stop to think what if I had a heart attack?	You look okay to me, Harry. Come over here and sit down. Tell me what you been up to.

1 Keep going.	Well, since Leo's name was on the passenger list...

1 Two time academy award nominee, Martin Weir.	Martin Weir. He played the mob guy that turned snitch in "The Cyclone".
2 One of his best parts.	No, his best part was the cripple gay guy that climbed Mt. Whitney.
3 "Ride the Clouds". Good picture.

1 Here's your keys, Harry.	Get the fuck outta my chair.

1 Which also means when I speak, I'm speakin' for Jimmy. So e.g. as of now, you start affording me the proper respect.	'E.g.' means 'for example', Ray. I think what you wanna say is 'i.e.'
2 Bullshit. E.g. is short for 'ergo'.	Ask your man here.

1 So when do I meet up with the husband and give him the look?	It's not that simple. You have to be careful. There's another guy that comes along, a hard-on you owe some money to. A mob guy. Wants to take you out anyway, on account of a past situation.
2 Okay. I'm listening.

1 It's not one of these?	You see a black leather jacket, fingertip length, like the one Pacino wore in Serpico? You don't, you owe me three seventy-nine.
2 Maybe you don't see my sign?

1 You been here the whole time?	I just caught the end.

1 So what about your story. You thought of a title yet?	How 'bout Get Shorty? Except that isn't a movie. That's real life.
2 How 'bout Chili's Hollywood Adventure.	That's a different story. I'm still working on that one, you know, getting the visual fabric just right.  Although I've added to it.

1 You okay?	Guy's got a fucking pink toilet, for Christ's sake.

1 I told you not to -	Don't say a fuckin' word.

1 I'm not sure how I feel about this, Doris.	You seem to feel fine about it.
2 I mean morally. Murray was my friend.	Murray's dead.

1 Harry, we spoke with Martin.	'We?'
2 Chili and me.

1 Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior. This is United States Coastguard Station North Island. Over.	North Island, I wish to declare myself salvor-in-posession under section four two charlie of the International Maritime Convention.
2 Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. What type of vessel?	A passenger liner. Over.
3 Say again. Over.

1 How about now?	Sixty pounds.
2 What? You sure?	That's what it says.
3 Lemme see.

1 When they find out what it's carrying, they may not be so interested in what's legal.	Maybe you shoulda thought a that before you scuttled our boat.

1 Seeing as though a foot of one of these fuckers weighs about a hundred pounds, it ain't gonna be what you'd call easy.  Any questions?	Supposing one of those cables breaks under tow.
2 Then we'll all be doomed. Any other questions?

1 Fifty million dollars. Fifty million. We gonna let this guy just take it from us? One guy?	So we kill him?
2 I'm saying we gotta do whatever we gotta do to preserve our interest.

1 You aren't jealous, are you Dodge?	Are you kidding me? Jealous? Epps? Gimme a break.

1 It's a hell of a lot of money.	What, you think there's something funny about it?
2 A ship with fifty million dollars in gold aboard, adrift? And nobody seems to care enough to come looking for it?

1 I say fuck the motherfucker. We're a professional salvage crew going about our business. What's some yahoo doing way out here by himself anyway?	And what do you propose? That we knock this guy off?
2 Why not? Why the fuck not?

1 So. I got a question. Just from a, you know, purely technical standpoint. We call the Coastguard.  Coastguard shows up. What exactly is the plan?	How do you mean?
2 Well, they're gonna be asking a lot of questions. About us. About those bodies. About the gold. Seems like we oughta be prepared is all.	I guess the best strategy's just to tell them the truth.
3 Yeah, well. The truth is one thing. When there's more than a few hundred million dollars involved, that's a whole new deal.	What do you propose?
4 For starters, getting that gold off the ship. What they don't know about isn't gonna bother them.

1 Tomorrow we'll see if we can't find some line and tackle. Use some of those bodies below decks for bait.	There's a charming thought.

1 What'd he look like?	Maybe six feet. Lanky. I didn't get a good look. He was far away. But I saw him. I saw him as sure as you're standing there.

1 Coffee?	Yeah. Thanks.

1 Got your light?	Yup.

1 "Their lacking diligence has undoubtedly caused the collision. Distress calls have been made."	Collision? With what?
2 The page's missing. Then their SOS was real.	But where's the damage?
3 Maybe the other ship took the worst of it.	If it was a ship she hit.

1 Murphy to Epps.	Epps, over.
2 Either of you seen Dodge?

1 The number nine on the starboard side's half flooded. Epps says it's a slow leak just under the waterline, about twenty gallons an hour. They must've pumped it before we left Sitka.	Of course they did.
2 Let the buyer beware.	What do you say, Dodge?

1 All we got to do is hit some rough weather and you can forget about it.	So we cut her loose and wait it out. A little weather couldn't be anything she hasn't seen before.

1 Greer?	Moving to Sweden.

1 Oh, man.	We heard you scream. Any idea what you might've seen?
2 I wish I could tell you. I'd be real interested to know myself.

1 What seems to be the trouble, ladies?	Whyn't you mind your own business, chief.

1 Pumpkin? What's wrong?	Nothing.

1 Hey... so, what brings you down here?	I uh... I feel that I need to uh -- there's something I feel I have to say... I uh, I've never said this to anyone before -- believe me, I've stayed in horrible relationships for years just so I wouldn't have to do this, but I uh...
2 What are you trying to say?	It's just that I feel like it's maybe not a good idea for us to keep going out.

1 What the hell is wrong with you?!	What? I'm just kidding around with the customers... It's my shtick!
2 Well lose it! And why aren't you pushing the large sizes? Didn't you get training about upsizing?	But I feel weird... it's so sleazy.
3 It's not optional!	Jesus...

1 Hi Josh.	Hi.
2 I just stopped in to say hi.	Yeah, well... hi...

1 Just think, we'll never have to see any of these creepy faces ever again.	Unless they're in your Summer school class!
2 Shut up!	Uh oh... don't turn around...
3 What? Why?	Forget it...

1 "Authentic 50's diner"? Since when were there mini-malls in the 1950's?	God, it's so totally pathetic.

1 Look at how cute I am!	What a little hosebag.

1 It's obviously him!	I can't believe it!

1 Ew, look at this...	Gross!
2 I think it's cute - look at his little weasel teeth.	Ew, it's like some gross rat...

1 JOSH!	JOSH!

1 Give me all your money, bitch!	Where did you get that?
2 You won't believe it! Guess!	Where?
3 Anthony's II!	No way... when?
4 Just now... I went with Seymour.	You cunt!

1 Do you want to do something tonight?	I can't, it's Seymour's birthday...  Shit! What time is it?  I have to go to the store! I was going to make him a cake...
2 Well, are we still going shopping tomorrow?	Yeah, I guess... call me...

1 There.	That's all you're bringing?
2 I'm gonna finish packing tonight... I'll bring it over tomorrow sometime.	What time?
3 I dunno...	Make sure you're here by noon - we have tons of stuff to do... Oh yeah! I have to show you something else!

1 May I ask what you're doing?	Shhh!
2 I want to know what you think you're doing, staying out all night and worrying your father to death!	Oh yeah, like he even noticed.
3 Listen, young lady... I know you don't like me -- I don't really care whether you do or not -- but I will not allow you to treat your father the way you do.

1 Well, if it isn't Enid and Rebecca, the little Jewish girl and her Aryan friend.	You're late, asshole.
2 Fine, and how are you?	Did you bring that tape?

1 Yeah, it took a while before I got a chance to play it, but when I heard that song it was like --	So you really liked it? Yeah, there's some really rare performances. You liked that Memphis Minnie, huh?
2 Yeah, that's good too... the whole record was good, but that one song, "Devil Got My Woman" -- I mostly just keep playing that one over and over... Do you have any other records like that?	The Skip James record? Yeah, that's a masterpiece. There are no other records like that! I actually have the original 78 of it in my collection. It's one of maybe five known copies.
3 Wow!	Do you want to see it? I can run upstairs and get it...
4 Yeah, sure, I guess...	Watch my stuff.

1 Wow! Look at all these creeps!	Shh!
2 OH MY GOD!

1 What the fuck, Seymour?! What is this?	What?... Oh that... I borrowed that from work about fifteen years ago... I guess it's mine now.
2 What, are you a klansman or something?	Yeah, right, I'm a klansman - thanks a lot!... Do you know the Cook's Chicken franchise?
3 "Four-piece Cook's special deep fried with side n' slaw it's OUT RAY-GEOUS"!	Yeah, well "Cook's" is just a made up name. When they originally opened back in 1922 they were named "The Coon Chicken Inn" -- that's an early painting of their first logo.

1 Boo!	YAAA!

1 God, she's going to kill me... this bottle is half-empty!	That's great! "Half-empty" - that's what I like about you, Seymour, you're a natural pessimist!
2 If you expect the worst, you're never disappointed.	What are you talking about? You're disappointed every minute of your life.
3 I'm just being realistic.	At least you're not like every other stupid guy in the world - all they care about are guitars and sports... they're all such fags!
4 I hate sports.	How come in all that time I was trying to get you a date, you never asked me out?
5 You're a beautiful young girl... I can't imagine you would ever have had any interest in me, except as an amusingly cranky eccentric curiosity.	Yeah, but still... it's kind of insulting for a girl to be ignored like that.
6 I mean... of course I... why wouldn't I want to go out with you?	I dunno... I always feel like everybody secretly hates me. I'm just paranoid I guess. I mean, you like me don't you? We're good friends, right?
7 Yeah, sure. Of course.	...Maybe I should just move in here with you... I could do all the cooking and dust your record collection and stuff until I get a job.
8 What about Joe?	Oh yeah... and Dana...  You were a lot more fun before you met Dana. You've been acting way too normal lately... you're a bitter, twisted, fucked-up guy, Seymour, that's why I like you.
9 Yeah, well I like you too...

1 I agree.	I wish I could see him.

1 -oh, sing a different song, Abdullah-  -there's nothing wrong with your men so stop telling me there is-	-you do not call me a liar- you know nothing of their health- consider yourself fortunate I persuaded so many to stay- consider yourself fortunate I have decided to stay-
2 You think you matter?  -Beaumont is on that train- he matters-

1 Pleasant journey?	How could it be? I hate Africa.

1 Understand, I had help-	-not a time for modesty, Bob-

1 Go, now.  Such a gentleman. 	I am desperate to see Africa- but I hate the leaving.

1 I couldn't believe it when you said "sort it out." As if it were the most normal thing in the world. "Ho-hum, what lovely tea, I think I'll bag a killer beast this evening, nothing much else going on anyway."	Well, he put me in a spot, didn't he? But that's all right- after all, I'm responsible for everything that happens here. And it certainly won't do much for morale if a man-eater's on the prowl.

1 Second death? Where?-	-far end of camp- man wandering alone at night. Hawthorne's examining the body now.  There's even less of him than of Singh.
2 But it's crazy- the lion shouldn't be that hungry this soon.  Samuel?

1 It would have been a beautiful bridge, John. I never noticed before, occupied with other business, I suppose...  ...never really pay much attention to that kind of thing but I've had the time today, nothing else on, and this... it's graceful and the placement couldn't be prettier... and... 	You just got hit.  The getting up is up to you- but they're only lions-  -and I'm going after them crack of dawn... 

1 Did it look like this in your mind?	This is more difficult-

1 He has children?	Once... 

1 Oh, yes, I got in a little late this morning, Janosz.	You know, you are really doing very good work here.  I think soon you may be ready to assist me in some of the more important restorations.
2 Thank you, Janosz.  I've learned a lot here, but now that my baby's a little older, I was hoping to rejoin the orchestra.

1 We'll do the happiness index next.  I'd like to bring Ray in on your case, if it's all right with you.	Okay, whatever you think -- but not Venkman.
2 Oh no.	Do you ever see him?
3 Occasionally	How is he these days?
4 Venkman?  I think he was borderline for a while there.  Then he crossed the border.	Does he ever mention me?
5 No.  Not that I can recall.

1 That's where the buggy stopped.	Okay, let's take a look.

1 Be careful on that sofa -- it's a butt-biter. But the bed's good and I just changed the sheets so if you get tired, feel free.  In fact, I think you should definitely plan on spending the night here.	Really?  And how would we handle the sleeping arrangements?
2 For me it's best if I sleep on my side and you spoon up right behind me with your arms around me.  If we go the other way I'm afraid your hair will be getting in my face all night.	How about you on the sofa and me in bed with the baby.
3 Or we could do that.	Thank you.  Poor baby.  I think I should put him down now.
4 I'll put him down for you.  You are way too short!  And your belly-button sticks out!  You're nothing but a burden to your poor mother!

1 Is this the spot?	A little to the left.  Right there!  That's where it stopped.

1 Who are you going to call?	Ghostbusters.

1 It's a painting I'm restoring for the new Byzantine exhibition.  It's a self-portrait of Prince Vigo, the Carpathian.  He ruled most of Carpathia and Moldavia in the 17th Century.	Too bad for the Moldavians.
2 

1 Keep that up, mister, and I'll find you in contempt.	Sorry, your Honor, but when somebody sets me up like that I can't resist.

1 Hey!  Wait!  Okay, I'll meet you there.	I thought you were like the fifth Ghostbuster.
2 I let them handle all the little stuff.  I just come in on the big ones.

1 "Vigo the Carpathian, born 1505, died 1610 --"	A hundred and five years?  He really hung on, didn't he.

1 Seems like a pretty open-minded guy, huh?	His nickname is "The Hammer."

1 There's definitely something going on in that studio.  The PKE levels were max-plus and the Giga-meter was showing all red.	I'd put my money on that Vigo character.

1 Geez, I forgot how heavy these things are.	Okay, let's heat 'em up!

1 What happened?	You just picked up three penalty points on your driver's license.

1 Vigi, Vigi, Vigi -- you have been a bad little monkey.	The whole city's together on this one.  We took a vote.  Everybody's down on you, you know.

1 Now that's one ugly dude.	Huh?  What?
2 You finished here?	What?  Yeah.
3 Are you all right?  You coming down with something?	No, I'm fine.  I just got light-headed for a second there.  Let's go.

1 And pure --	And decent.

1 Well, I guess some people have it and some don't.	Do you think I have it, Dr. Venkman?
2 Definitely.  I think you may be a very gifted telepath.

1 Is that your professional opinion?	It's in the stars.

1 Great rehearsal.	You heard it?
2 You're the best one in your row.	Most people can't hear me with the whole orchestra playing.  You're good.
3 I don't have to take abuse from you.  I have other people dying to give it to me.	I know.  You're quite a celebrity these days.  Are you here because you have info ... about my case?
4 Who's the stiff?	The "stiff?"  He happens to be one of the finest musicians in the world and a wonderful man.
5 Is he dying or something?

1 Well, that definitely looks like marshmallow to me.	Yeah, it's some kind of mallow-type substance - that's for sure.
2 You have to wonder why anybody would dump a marshmallow that size right in the middle of the street.	I wonder if there might not be a very large cup of hot chocolate somewhere in the area.
3 That would definitely explain it.

1 Thank you for coming so quickly.  The guests are starting to ask questions and I'm running out of excuses.	Has this ever happened before?
2 Well, most of the original staff knows about the twelfth floor ... The disturbances, I mean ... But it's been quiet for years ... Up until two weeks ago ... It was never ever this bad, though.	Did you ever report it to anyone?
3 Heavens, no!  The owners don't like us to even talk about it.  I hoped we could take care of this quietly tonight.	Yes, sir.  Don't worry.  We handle this kind of thing all the time.

1 Nervous?	Yes.  I don't like this.
2 Well, just 75 more to go.  What's this one?	Two wavy lines?
3 Sorry.  This isn't your day.

1 Something was definitely here.	Yeah, I can smell it.

1 You know, Peter, this could be a past life experience intruding on the present.	Or even a race memory, stored in the collective unconscious.  And I wouldn't rule out clairvoyance or telepathic contact either.

1 Excuse me for a minute.  Ray, I'm right in the middle of something here.  Can you come back in about an hour?	Peter, at 1:40 this afternoon at the main branch of the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue, ten people witnessed a free-roaming, vaporous, full-torso apparition.  It blew books from shelves at twenty feet away.  Scared the socks off some poor librarian.
2 Sure.  That's great, Ray.  I think you should get down there right away and check it out.  Let me know what happens.	No, this one's for real, Peter.  Spengler went down there and took some PKE readings. Right off the top of the scale.  Buried the needle.  We're close this time. I can feel it.

1 Wow!  Does this pole still work?	This might do ... I don't know ... it just seems kind of "pricey" for a fixer-upper, don't you think?  We're trying to keep our costs down.  You know how it is when you're starting a new company.

1 Egon, how's the grid around the storage facility holding up?	It's not good, Pete.

1 Stantz?  You okay in there?	LATER, MAN!!

1 Those are priceless sculptures.	I want every single thing that belonged to my father out of this house!  If it's worth something then sell it!

1 Damn him!  I should have killed him on the front -- I let you talk me out of that.	You would have had a full scale revolt on your hands.
2 What have I got now?  It's exactly as if there were two emperors. Because of this the people have two minds.  He is their champion.

1 Where is my family?	Cooperate and they will be returned to your estate.  I could have executed you.
2 And my army would have thrown your body into the Danube.

1 Gladly, Caesar.  And, if you'd like we can take you for a tour of the front at first light.	I'm certain father will be in better humors by then.  Now, honor us with your presence at dinner.  I'll join you as soon as I see my father's physician.

1 You won an impossible fight.  You got the attention of the crowd, legate...	This is Cos, this precocious young man.  A scribe for the Daily Action.  I've invited him to write a small piece about you...
2 I'm mentioning you in tomorrow's athlete's section, legate.  So, I'd love to know your birth sign; it effects how people bet.  And perhaps you could tell me a bit about... well, who are you?

1 The Senate too?	The moment you returned from the battle your options were clear.  If you are a friend to neither side, legate, you must be an enemy to both.  We needed to know what you believed.
2 I hope you live to see what I believe...

1 To think I brought my daughters up on all things Roman.  Read to sleep on Catullus, Lucretius... Virgil... every night.  My beautiful daughters.	Do you remember your Epictetus, that little homily we recited when we were children?  The one that was supposed to remind us we were Romans?

1 What the hell was all that about?	What the hell do you think it was about?  There's nothing an unproved heir to the throne likes less than glaring competence in others.
2 Why don't we try to keep politics out of the conversation.	Well, we can try...

1 You need to come home!	I can see that...
2 The battle is over.  The war is over.  You've won!	If you win, you know, you have to stay.  It's the losers who get to go home.  Besides, I'm not so sure it is over.  Centurions report enemy scouts probing our lines.

1 Take your hands off me animal!	Chain him.

1 You put this inside your shirt -- when Tiger stabs your stomach -- it's full of pig's blood.  Gushes out everywhere!  It's really impressive.  Fantastic!  Better than the real thing!	So I pretend I'm dead.  You get gold, what do I get?
2 You get to come alive again in the country!	As, what, 'The Galloping Gladiator?!'
3 The point is you get to fight the easy country circuit, the small arenas, relax, live the good life!	Spend my days beheading country bumpkins?  I don't know, Proximo, who has better wine than you? Besides, I'm beginning to think of the Colosseum as my home.
4 But -- you have to go out there! I'll give you more than your one third!  When I get paid... just take the fall!  You're too hurt to fight and the man's a killer!	Pressures on, eh Proximo?  There's got to be a load of money in this. Why else would you toss a red hot commodity like me out the window?
5 It's absolutely not like that!  This is for your own good!  Come on get the rest of your armor on!

1 Aren't you eating?	No.
2 Why not?	If it's all right with you, I'm not hungry.

1 Listen, Elaine -- it seems to me that there isn't a bar in here. I mean -- as far as I know.	Of course there is. Look -- The Veranda Room -- right there.

1 Elaine --	Oh my God --

1 Why?	Because it isn't true.
2 I don't feel well.

1 Benjamin?	What?
2 Will you kiss me!

1 Are we getting married tomorrow?	No.
2 The day after tomorrow?	Maybe we are and maybe we aren't.

1 You're not one of those agitators?	What?
2 One of those outside agitators.	Oh -- no sir.
3 I hate that. I won't stand for it.

1 I'm putting it here by the door.	Will you bring it in to me?
2 I'd rather not.	All right. Put it in the room where we were.
3 Right.

1 Is it a girl?	Is what a girl?
2 Whatever it is you're upset about.	Oh -- no. I'm just sort of disturbed about things.
3 In general.	That's right.

1 Are you always this much afraid of being alone?	Yes.
2 Well, why can't you just lock the doors and go to bed?	I'm very neurotic.

1 I really don't want to put this on again. Won't you bring it up?	Where is it?
2 On that chair in the hall.

1 Did you get us a room?	What?
2 Have you gotten us a room yet?	I haven't. No.
3 Do you want to?	Well -- I don't. I mean I could. Or we could just talk.
4 Do you want me to get it?	You? Oh no. No. I'll get it.
5 Do you want to get it now?	Now?
6 Yes.	Well -- I don't know.
7 Why don't you get it.	Why don't I get it? Well -- I will then.  If you'll excuse me.

1 Can I take off my clothes now?	No. Think of another topic. Tell me what you did today.
2 Do you really want me to?	Yes I do.
3 I got up.

1 Don't talk about Elaine.	Don't talk about Elaine?
2 No.	Why not?
3 Because I don't want you to.

1 Now listen -- this was not my idea. It was my father's idea.	Benjamin -- I thought I made myself perfectly clear about this.
2 Look, we'll go out to dinner and have a drink and I'll bring her back. Because it was either that or a dinner party for the two families. And I'm afraid I couldn't quite handle that, if you don't mind. I have no intention of ever taking your precious daughter out again in her life. So don't get upset about it.	But I am. I'm extremely upset about it, Benjamin.

1 Braddock -- Braddock?	Yes, but I'm afraid --
2 I'll find your table in a moment. Braddock. Not Braniff? We have a Braniff.	No -- actually I'm just looking for a friend.
3 I'm afraid I don't understand.	I'm not with your party -- I'm sorry.
4 Hey -- I don't get it.

1 I'm going up to Berkeley today.	Oh, Ben -- this is so -- exciting --

1 I drove -- I drove Mrs. Robinson home. She wanted me to drive her home so I -- I drove her home.	Swell. I appreciate it.
2 She's upstairs. She wanted me to wait down here till you got home.	Standing guard over the old castle, are you?
3 Yes, sir.

1 Hello.	Mrs. Robinson?
2 Yes?	It's Benjamin.
3 Yes?	Benjamin Braddock.
4 Benjamin -- where are you?	Can you look through the glass.

1 Turn 'em up.	Oh yes -- that's right -- look! I win, don't I -- 

1 I've quit.	You can't.
2 I'm not going to get those pearls and neither are you.	What about the money?
3 I'll pay you back.	How?
4 I have an idea working in my head... 	You might find a bullet through that head...
5 If you did that, you'd get nothing except the police after you. If you wait -- I'll give you your six thousand back --

1 Flaemmchen, what are you doing here in the middle of the night.	Looking for my room -- one sixty- six.
2 You live here?	For tonight. 
3 Oh!	Yes -- oh!
4 Well -- such is life, Flaemmchen.	And Baron, thanks so much for everything.

1 There.	Oh -- 

1 And this is Doctor Otternschlag.	Oh -- Doctor -- you are a Doctor -- I am --

1 Is that too much, Baron?	No -- not at all.
2 All right then.	All right then.

1 Pardon me, the lady has urgent business here with me.	Insolent -- Berlin manners.

1 Madam Grusinskaya -- at once --	Your chauffeur's been waiting, Baron.

1 Barman -- whiskey --  For you, Mr. Kringelein?	For me? -- Oh, please, something sweet and cold.

1 Her master's voice!  I must go now -- goodbye -- thanks.	Oh, don't go.
2 I'm engaged for the evening.	Oh, can anyone engage you for the evening?
3 To take dictation -- a Mr. Preysing --  Goodbye, you -- tomorrow at five o'clock. 

1 How do you know there is a Grand Hotel?	Oh, there must be one in Paris... They have everything in Paris.

1 Moreover... He was a lucky man -- that man.	Perhaps. 

1 You are late. I've been waiting for you -- waiting.	I had to arrange about the trip.
2 You're sweet.	You think so?

1 Now to proceed with the projected merger, the advantages for the Saxonia are so obvious...	Oh -- now let's talk like adults. You want to tell us now a along story of what your factory can do. We know all that you could tell us and if you tell the truth it wouldn't sound so good. When you first approached us...
2 We did not approach you.

1 ...and let me say again for the tenth time...  ...you people were quite ready for the merger. You declared yourselves... fully agreed on all the terms -- Why should the signing of these articles be suddenly held up?	I've admitted that at one time we had reason for desiring ther merger -- What reason have we now? The Preysing Company has fallon upon evil days, very evil days.

1 Ah, oui -- the car is here for Madam.	Send it away -- I shan't need it.

1 I suppose I can cancel the Vienna engagement.	I wish to be alone.
2 You'll be very much alone, my dear madame. This is the end. 

1 I wish you a very good evening, Mr. Preysing. You are staying here, too, Mr. Preysing?	I don't know you.
2 Oh -- you must know me -- Kringelein at the plant. Assistant bookkeeper, building C, room twenty-three -- third floor.

1 How is the house?	Terrible. After this, no more ballets for me. Jazz --  Just jazz.
2 If the house is empty again, I don't know --	When she gets her paint on and hears the music -- she'll be all right. I know these people.

1 Well, I guess so. You're the guy I work for.	You work for me, huh? Then I just may flush you down the toilet. Drive me to the Durando.

1 Not skimming a thing, Lilly?	Oh, well, you know. I just clip a buck here and a buck there. Not enough to notice.
2 That's right. Take a little, leave a little.	A person that don't look out for himself is too dumb to look out for anybody else. He's a liability, right, Bobo?
3 You're a thousand percent right!	Or else he's working an angle. If he doesn't steal a little, he's steeling big.
4 You know it, Lilly.	You know, I like that suit, Bobo. I don't know what there is about it, but it somehow makes you look taller.
5 Yeah? You really think so? A lot of people been telling me the same thing.	Well, you can tell them I said they're right.  I better get going. Roy'll wonder where I am.
6 Worries about his mother, eh? Give him a hug for me.	I will. So long, Bobo.

1 Well. If Mary Beth vouches for you, and if she told you the story already...	So here we are!
2 Mister Hebbing, we are talking about breaking the law here, I want to be sure you understand that. No one gets hurt, but the law does get broken.

1 The ambulance is on the way, for what good it will do.	What? He's going to be all right!
2 Mrs. Dillon, your son was in some sort of accident. He's had an internal hemorrhage, he's bleeding to death inside.	Well, make it stop!
3 His blood pressure is under a hundred. I don't think he'll live to get to the hospital.	You know who I work for.

1 When I said you being the best salesman here didn't say much, I meant for us. I know your record with Sarber and Webb, and I'd say you're a top-flight man, but you've had no incentive. No one walking on your heels. Just a lot of half asses, so the tendency's been not to stretch yourself. I'm bouncing the slobs, incidentally.	So I heard.
2 Makes no difference to me if they're only on commission. If they don't make good money, they're not giving us good representation, and we can't afford to have them around. Ever supervise salesmen?	Just myself.
3 That's right, you've had to supervise yourself. This place needs a sales manager. Somebody who's proved he's a salesman and can handle other salesmen. He'd have a lot of deadwood to clear out, new men to hire. What do you think?

1 What happened to your hand?	Just a little accident. I went by your place, picked up your mall. Just bills, I'll take care of them.
2 I can take care of my own bills, Lilly.	Whatever you say. The manager says your boss called.  Really pulled the wool over everybody's eyes, huh?
3 What are you talking about? So I've got a job. So what?	Stop kidding me! Four years in a town like Los Ang-gleez, and a peanut selling job is the best you can do? You expect me to believe that?
4 It's there. The boss called, you said so yourself.	And that dump you live in! Those clown pictures on the walls!

1 If you come out to the track, don't know me.	We won't hit the track. The beach. Couple a nice restaurants.

1 I'm sorry. I hated to take your money, but --	Don't be sorry. You're not taking it.

1 Roy... What if I told you I wasn't really your mother? That we weren't related?	What?

1 You aren't taking me for granted, are you?	Taking you for granite?

1 What if we want to drive somewhere while we're there?	We'll rent a car.

1 I still don't see why we have to have separate rooms. You expect your father to come through?	Separate bathrooms, darling. I will not lay out all my cosmetics for you to knock over.
2 Things a man isn't supposed to know.	You don't mind, really, do you, Roy? It's been such a wonderful evening, I guess I just wore myself out.
3 Sure. I'm pretty tired myself.

1 Roy Dillon?	Yes?
2 Lieutenant Pierson, Phoenix police. I have a car here.	Thank you.

1 One set of muddy shoe prints.	That don't match either of the victim's.

1 Detective Carter from the Haddonfield P.D.	Toni Blake from Langley P.D.

1 Nothing to fear.  The coast is clear.	You sure?
2 Totally.  I checked all the rooms and closets...	Nothing's missing?
3 Don't think so.  But they sure did a real number on your office. Crap everywhere.	My office?
4 Yeah.  Oh, and they messed up your kitchen pretty good, too... Goodnight.

1 You some kind of fugitive or something?	I was trying to get away from someone.

1 What are you doing here?!	I came to see you.
2 I can see that.  Why?	Can I come in?
3 Are you crazy?  You'll get caught.	Then you come out here.
4 Then I'll get caught.	Well, I'm not going until I talk to you.
5 Alright.  I'll come out.  Just be quiet.

1 There's something I have to tell you both.  It's going to sound strange...	What?
2 My name hasn't always been Keri Tate.  It was once Laurie Strode.	You're right.  It does sound strange.

1 Fuckin' A.	He gave me a fuckin' A?  Wow.

1 Hold on, hot lips.  We got work to do.	Shit, Beth, why do we have to be the ones to organnize this friggin' fair? It's only Halloween.

1 No, Mom -- keep it on!	Okay ... But just for tonight.

1 He crept up these stairs and made his way into this room.  His sister's room. Right here. Where it all began.	What makes you think he'll come here again?
2 This house is sacred to him.  It's the source of his memories -- his rage.  Mrs. Strode, I beg you.  Don't let your family suffer the same fast as Laurie and her daughter.	Jamie?  But I thought she was --
3 Found this morning.  In a field outside Haddonfield.  Stabbed.

1 It was there when I found him this morning.  It looks like some kind of letter or number or --	It's a rune ... Thorn.

1 We need you, Dr. Loomis.	You should know that it's not wise to play Halloween pranks on me.
2 You're the only man for the job, Sam. Things haven't been the same since you left.  I'm recruiting the best psychiatric team in the country.  Old colleagues.  This is your change to finally make a difference.

1 Come now, Sam.  This is a gathering of old friends.  I know how difficult this must be for you -- a man of your upbringing and integrity -- but now that I'm in charge I felt it was only fair that you finally know the truth.  After all, you're the only one around here who's still in the dark, as it were.  This isn't the way I wanted to tell you, but you've really given me no other choice.	This is madness, Wynn.
2 Your madness is another man's greatness.  This is the way things have always been.  You've just been too blinded by your own reality to see.  But having you on the outside has been convenient for us in many ways.  You always did come through -- our loyal watch dog. Finding him. Bringing him back to us once he'd finished his work.  Although after you had that nasty stroke the last time, I had to go after him myself.  And what a terrible time we had getting him out of that jail cell.	It was you.
3 Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.	Why did you take Jamie?
4 She has the gift -- the blood of Thorn running through her veins.  Michael's mother had it, too.  So for six years I incubated her, prepared her for this night.  Michael has served his purpose.  And soon we will have a new progeny.	Jamie's baby ...
5 There you go trying to make sense again.  It's a curse.  Handed down through countless generations. As ageless as this celebration which you call Halloween.	Samhain.
6 And I'm its deliverer.  Its calling card, if you will.  I follow it.  Protect it. Act as its guardian.  In a sense, Sam, so do you.

1 It appears that we're going to have to wait awhile for any more action here, Colonel.  Why don't you run on home while the evening's young.	Home.  Jesus.  I'm like this.  Home!
2 Home is important to a man.	You know what gets me?
3 No.	How all the magazines show tits today.
4 Um.	Used to be against the law, didn't it?
5 I suppose.	Must have changed that law.

1 What's funny about that?	You know me, boy.

1 Are we really going to find out where the elephants go to die?	I'd rather go to Viet Nam.
2 Would somebody please pass me the catsup?	What you say is, "Pass the fucking catsup."
3 Pass the fucking catsup.

1 Mhravitch.  Remember that name.	Mhravitch.
2 The name will live forever.  It was there that Harold Ryan slew the Beast of Yugoslavia.  Mhravitch.	When I grow up, I'm going to go to Mhravitch.
3 It's rather a disappointment these days.  It isn't there any more.	Sir?
4 The Germans shot everybody who lived there, then leveled it, plowed it, planted turnips and cabbages in the fertile ground. They wished revenge for the slaying of the Beast of Yugoslavia.  To their twisted way of thinking, your father had butchered an Eagle Scout.  Play lots of contact sports?	I wanted to go out for football, but Mom was afraid I'd get hurt.
5 You're supposed to get hurt!	Dr. Woodly says he's seen hundreds of children permanently injured by football.  He says that when there's a war, everybody goes but football players.
6 Does it bother you to have your mother engaged to a man like that?	They're not engaged.
7 He seems to think they are.  He told me that were.	Oh no, no, no, no, no.  It can't be. How embarrassing.
8 You're a very good boy to respond that way.	No, no, no, no, no.
9 I'd like to use the sanitary facilities, if I may.	Go ahead.  No, no, no, no.

1 Mom?	What's this?

1 Bluh.	You'd better get Dr. Woodly.

1 Now--turn around, if you would.	Turn around?
2 I'm not about to introduce to you a jungle novelty.  What I have in mind is massage--a perfectly decent massage.  Turn around, turn around.

1 Things.	You feel I've done a dreadful thing--leaving him?

1 I'm turning off the alarm.  I'm turning off everything.	Ah!  The lady is armed.
2 I want you to get out of here, Norbert.  Harold--I want you to sit down in the chair, and not lift a finger until Norbert is gone.	Whoever has the gun, you see, gets to tell everybody else exactly what to do.  It's the American way.
3 I mean it!	Then you'd better fix your bayonet, because there aren't any bullets in the gun.
4 Where's the bullet?

1 Look--I'm sorry--I have to go.	We'll miss you so.
2 Look--this isn't my apartment, and there isn't anybody else here.  Mrs. Ryan won't be home for a while.	Oh, oh, oh--I thought it was your apartment.  You seemed at home here.
3 I'm a neighbor.  I have the apartment across the hall.  I have to go to the hospital now.  An emergency.

1 You can also describe its cure. I'm eating its cure.	I was going to ask.
2 Pacqualinincheewa root.	Would you say that again?
3 Pacqualinincheewa root.  Means "cougar fang." Cures anything but a yellow streak down the back.	I've never heard of it.
4 Congratulations.  By crossing twenty-eight feet of cockroach- infested carpet, you've become the third white man ever to hear of it.	Are you've seen it work cures?
5 Hundreds.

1 I haven't told you, Harold, how comical I think you are.	Comical?

1 Dead!	Jesus.
2 Alice is dead?	No, no--shit no.  Excuse me, Penelope.
3 For what?	For saying "shit." Or is that okay now?
4 Who's dead?	My mother-in-law.  Fire engines, pulmotors, doctors, cops, coroners--
5 What happened?	Well--I walked up to the front door. I was still alive.  Big surprise. I rang the doorbell, and old Mrs. Wheeler answered.  She had her Goddamn knitting.  I said, "Guess who?" She conked right out.
6 How horrible.	Yeah--cripes.  I never did get any sense out of Alice.  She found me holding up the old lady, dead as a mackerel.  It was a bitch.  You know--maybe Mrs. Wheeler was going to die then and there anyway, even if I'd been the paper boy.  Maybe not.  I dunno, boy.  That's civilian life for you.  Who knows what kills anybody?

1 That goes double for me.	I don't want to live any more.
2 I feel like I want to yell my head off--just yell anything.  Bulllllllllllllll-dickey!	I'll kill myself.
3 The wife of Harold Ryan is going to marry a pansy next?  This is the end of Western Civilization as far as I'm concerned.  You must be crazy as a fruitcake.

1 What are his symptoms?	Shivers and sweats and groans.  His teeth chatter.  What'll we do?
2 What does he say to do?	He can hardly talk.

1 Yes?	Something happens to my confidence.
2 This conversation took place, incidentally, about three months before Harold was declared legally dead.	When Harold is definitely out of the picture, Penelope, when I don't have to worry about doing him wrong or you wrong or Paul wrong.  I'm going to ask you to be my wife.
3 I'm touched.	That's when I'll get my confidence back.
4 I see.	If you'll pardon the expression, that's when you'll see the fur and feathers fly.  Good night.
5 Good night.

1 I am Dr. Norbert Woodly--a physician, a healer.  I find it disgusting and frightening that a killer should be a respected member of society.  Gentleness must replace violence everywhere, or we are doomed.	Would you like to say something about killing, Colonel?

1 Get out of here.	It's really that bad?

1 If he'd just get into scouting, and camp out some, and see how everybody roughhouses around the fire--	What a beautiful demonstration this is of the utter necessity of rites of passage.
2 I feel like I've been double- crossed.  If you'd just told me it was Harold's birthday--

1 You're still dressed?	Well, I want to...
2 Sit down. Make yourself comfortable. My name's Felice.

1 Is this all the display space we can get?	I tried to get more, but this is the limit. The De Vries line has the same area.

1 Are you a private detective?	Something like that. How much do you make?
2 Here? What a joke. There was some detective asking about that girl.	Three hundred?
3 This is just temporary. I once made nine hundred in outcall.	I'll give you $700 a week, cash, if you help me find this girl.
4 Up front?	Half now, half later.
5 Make it nine hundred. That was my best week.	Okay. My client pays for it anyway.
6 When do we start?	Tonight. When you get out, we'll go.  Why didn't you tell the other detective?
7 This is different. This is nine hundred dollars.

1 Be that as it may. U is for Unconditional Election. God has chosen a certain number of people to be saved, The Elect, and He has chosen them from the beginning of time. L is for Limited Atonement. Only a limited number will be atoned, will go to Heaven.	Fuck.
2 I can stop if you want.	No, please go on.

1 Did you find out where she was?	Tod gave me the slip. I have to find him again. Where does he live?
2 What happened?	Where is he?
3 I can't tell you that.

1 Oh, fuck off. You should stay where you belong.	Get out. Get out of here, Goddammit.

1 Is Marsha there?	Yeah. She's quite upset. I'm going to fly out today. They want me to bring some pictures.
2 I'll come with you. Let me pack some things.

1 What do you want?  Do I know you from somewhere?	I want to know where my daughter is. Her name is Kristen, or Joanne. She's with you.
2 I don't know what you're talking about.

1 No. I walked up. Don't ride elevators.	My secretary said you wanted to discuss a business proposition.
2 Yes.  I'm interested in financing an adult feature film. I was told you were the man to come to.	Film making can be pretty expensive...

1 You know Granville's looking for you, Niki?	My name ain't Niki. It's Pattica, like in Attica.
2 Granville's looking for you anyway.	Who's that?
3 The guy who bought you that ring.	Well, he can just fuck himself.

1 Lady, you were going 70 miles an hour in a 45-mile zone. Could I see your license, please?	Yes. Those little pieces of paper with your picture on it?
2 Yes.	Oh, I don't have one.
3 Come again.	I don't have one. I don't believe in them.
4 How long have you been driving?	About forty-five minutes, wouldn't you say, Harold? We were hoping to start sooner but, you see, it's rather hard to find a truck.
5 Could I see your registration?	I just don't think we have one, unless it's in the glove compartment. Could you look, Harold?
6 Isn't this your vehicle?	No, no. I just took it.
7 Took it?	Yes. You see I have to plant my tree.
8 Your tree.	Well, it's not really mine. I dug it up in front of the courthouse. We're transplanting it. Letting it breathe, you know. But, of course, we would like to get it into soil, as soon as possible.
9 Lady, let me get this straight.	All right, then, and we'll be off.  Nice chatting with you.

1 Here's your shovel.	What?... Oh yes... Shovel... Create ... Verily these issues lie in the lap of the gods... Iliad... Just sit down for a minute.

1 Harold?	Maude???!

1 Why do you say that?	Because they are all the same.
2 Oooh, but they are not. Look.

1 What's that?	My umbrella?  Oh, that's just a relic. I found it when I was packing to come to America. It used to be my defense on picket lines and rallies and political meetings - being dragged off by police or attacked by thugs of the opposition.  A long time ago.
2 What were you fighting for?	Oh, Big Issues. Liberty. Rights. Justice. Kings died and kingdoms fell. I don't regret the kingdoms - what sense in borders and nations and patriotism - but I do miss the kings. When I was a little girl I was taken to the palace in Vienna, to a garden party. I can still see the sunshine, the parasols, and the flashing uniforms of the young officers. I thought then I would marry a soldier.  Later, Frederick would chide me about it.  He was so serious. A doctor at the University. And in the government.

1 I like Glaucus.	Yes, so do I. But I think he is a little... old-fashioned. Like a puff, Harold?
2 Well, I really don't smoke.	It's all right.  It's organic.
3 I'm sure picking up on vices.	Vice? Virtue? It's best not to be too moral. You cheat yourself out of too much life. Aim above morality. As Confucius says, "Don't simply be good. Make good things happen."
4 Did Confucius say that?	Well --  - they say he was very wise, so I'm sure he must have.
5 You are the wisest person I know.	Me!  When I look around me I know I know nothing. I remember though, once long ago in Persia, we met a wise man in the bazaar. He was a professional and used to sell his wisdom to anyone willing to pay. His specialty for tourists was a maxim engraved on the head of a pin. "The wisest," he said, "the truest, the most instructive words for all men at all times." Frederick bought one for me and back at the hotel I peered through a magnifying glass to read the words - "And this too shall pass away."  Well, the wise man was right - if you remember that, you can't help but live life fully.
6 Yes. I haven't lived.  I've died a few times.	What was that?
7 Died! Seventeen times - not counting maiming.  Shot myself in the face once with a popgun and a pellet of blood.	How ingenious! Tell me about them.
8 Well, it's a question of timing, and the right equipment, and plenty of patience... You really want to hear about this?	Of course.
9 Okay.

1 Don't you talk to me like that, you little foul mouth degenerate!  Really, sir, I thought that you at least...	Traitor! Benedict Arnold! Remember Nathan Hale, right, sir?

1 I was remembering how much this meant to me. It was after the war... I had nothing... except my life. How different I was then - and yet how the same.	You've never cried before. I never thought you would. I thought, despite anything, you could always be happy.
2 Oh, Harold. You are so young.

1 Love? Love? What do you <u>know</u> about her? Where does she come from? Where did you meet her?	At a funeral.
2 Oh... That's wonderful... I get an eighty-year-old pallbearer for a daughter-in-law! Be reasonable, Harold! You're dealing with your life! What will people say?!	I don't care what people say.
3 You don't care! "Miss Shroud of 1890 Weds the Boy of a Thousand Deaths!" Listen to me...

1 I don't think I'm getting through to Mother like I used to.	Does that worry you?
2 Yes. It does.	Why?
3 I put a lot of effort into these things.	Ah, yes.
4 And a lot of time.	I'm sure. But what else do you do with your time? Do you go to school?
5 No.	What about the draft?
6 My mother spoke to my Uncle Victor. He's in the Army and he fixed it up.	Oh. Well, how do you spend your day?
7 You mean when I'm not working on a...	Yes. What kind of things do you do?

1 Will they really teach me to shoot?	Oh, sure. A variety of weapons.
2 And to use the bayonet? PACHOIE!	Oh sure.
3 How about hand-to-hand combat?	Yes.
4 To strangle someone. Choke him. Squeeze out his life between your hands.	Eh?
5 How about to slit his throat?	Well, I don't...
6 I'd like that. You could see the blood squirt out.	Harold, I think you're getting carried away here.
7 Sir, how about souvenirs?	Souvenirs?
8 Of your kill - ears, nose, scalp, privates.	Harold!
9 What's the chance of getting one of these?

1 Oh. No Boxes. Such a shame.	No more delays, Kirsty. No more teasing. Time to play.
2 Time to play.

1 I knew you'd come back.	I'm a girl who keeps her promises.

1 What?	The Boxes. In the House. I told you.
2 What do you mean?	The boxes! I TOLD you.
3 You DIDN'T tell me. Do you mean Malahide's got...	Yeah. The things you were talking about.

1 I... remember.	You were ALL human!

1 Don't get psychic with me.	Nothing psychic about it. You're easy.

1 hound of resurrection --	See? I don't like that --
2 -- Hound of resurrection?

1 It's almost over!!	No. It's not.

1 It's her choice --  She's human --	Oh, as opposed to -- ?

1 At nineteen hundred hours an alarm tripped. B&E. Robbery. Six guards dead --	Hold on -- hold on -- I thought we checked this place. Fakes, and reproductions.

1 You will never fulfill your destiny. You will never understand the power inside you.	I can live with that.

1 Whatcha looking at, John??	Oh-n-no -- I --

1 Myers, you're a talker. What's a good word -- a solid word for "need" --	"Need" is a good, solid word.
2 Nah, sounds too "needy."	Start in, you got nachos coming.

1 Hi.	I've changed my mind. I'll come to Moscow. If you -- are still going --

1 Hello, I'm --	-- Late. Five minutes late.
2 Yes, I --	-- Section fifty-one. Step back.
3 Pardon?	Two steps back, please.

1 Oh.	Julia's my second wife.
2 Lucky man.	Damn right. Now are we going to move the bed or not?

1 We've got such sights to show you --	You can keep them.

1 Oh my God.	Don't mourn him. He was dead long before we laid a finger on him.

1 ...somebody...	Ssh!

1 You can't love him.	I don't.
2 So where's the harm?	I said no.
3 Then find me somebody else, before they come looking.

1 How long since you were here?	The best part of ten years.

1 How are you doing through there?	It looks like a bomb's dropped.

1 Just a moment. Put on some music will you babe?	O.K.

1 Not much fun, is it?	What?
2 Drinking alone.	Not much.
3 I wonder, maybe...

1 Why don't you do the same?	Maybe I will.

1 I thought you were going to stay with us for awhile?	No Dad.
2 You'd like the house.	YOU'D like my room.
3 Do you want me to come over?

1 Would you... maybe call round sometime? Try to make friends.	Sure.
2 Maybe all she needs is some company.

1 I'm here.	I thought we'd lost you.
2 I'm coming!  Sleep well.

1 What?	Just go. PLEASE. I'll be O.K. I'm going to go see Dad. He'll look after me --
2 What did I say?	Will you GO, damn you?

1 Nice, Barry.	Rob.  Top five musical crimes perpetrated by Stevie Wonder in the '80's and '90's.  Subquestion -- is it in fact unfair to criticize a formerly great artist for his latter- day sins?  "Is it better to burn out than to fade away?"
2 You just drove a fucking customer away, Barry.	We didn't even really have it.  I happen to know for a fact that the only Stevie Wonder single we have is "Don't Drive Drunk." I was just goofing on the straight, and it never cost you a penny.
3 Not the point.	Oh, so what's the point then?
4 I don't want you talking to our customers like that again.	"Our customers?" You think that Mr. L.L. Bean out there is going to be a regular?

1 I'd think you were a cinematic idiot. And I'd feel sorry for you.	No, but would you think, from that one sentence.  That I was going to see it?
2 I'm sorry, Rob, but I'm struggling here.  I don't understand any part of this conversation.  You're asking me what I would think if you told me that you hadn't seen a film that you've seen.  What am I supposed to say?	Just listen to me.  If I said to you --
3 "-- I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet," yeah, yeah, I hear you --	Would you... would you get the impression that I wanted to see it?
4 Well... you couldn't have been desperate to see it, otherwise you'd have already gone...

1 What's up?	Laura.  Her dad died.
2 Ooh.  Drag.

1 That is perverse.  Do not tell anyone you don't own fucking Blonde on Blonde.  What about Television?	I have a television.
2 NO--!

1 Okay, okay -- "Leader of the Pack." The guy fucking cracks up on a cycle and dies right? "Dead Man's Curve," Jan and Dean...	Did you know that after that song was recorded, Jan himself crashed his --
2 -- It was Dean, you fucking idiot.

1 Hey Charlie.	Hey Rob.
2 Why did you break up with me for Marco?	Fuck!  I knew it!  You're going through one of those what-does-it- all-mean things.
3 Huh?	There's been a rash of them, recently. I find it a little unnerving.  In fact Marco called a few months back, and he wanted to see me, and rehash the past as they say, and I wasn't really up for it.  Do all men go through this?
4 C'mon, just answer the question. You can say what you like.  What the hell?

1 Rob.	Liz, hold on a second --  What?
2 Marie LaSalle is in the store!  Here, she's here, and now!

1 Can I help you?	Hello, Rob.  Remember me?  I'm Ray. Ian.

1 You used to care more about things like Marvin Gaye than you do now. When I first met you, and I made you that tape, you loved it.  You said -- and I quote -- "It was so good it made you ashamed of your record collection."	Well, I liked you.  You were a deejay, and I thought you were hot, and I didn't have a boyfriend, and I wanted one.
2 So you weren't interested in music at all?	Yeah, sure.  More so then than I am now.  That's life though, isn't it?

1 Well if you could tell me roughly it would help.	Okay, okay, we have a nine percent chance of getting back together. Does that clarify the situation?
2 Yeah.  Great.	I'm too tired for this now.  I know I'm asking a lot, but will you take off for a while so I can get my stuff packed up?  I need to be able to think while I do it and I can't think while you're here.
3 No problem.  If I can ask one question.	Fine.  One.
4 It sounds stupid.	Nevermind.
5 You won't like it.	Just ask it!
6 Is it better?	Is what better?  Better than what?
7 Well.  Sex, I guess.  Is sex with him better?	Jesus Christ, Rob.  Is that really what's bothering you?
8 Of course it is.	You really think it would make a difference either way?
9 I don't know.	Well the answer is that I don't know either.  We haven't done it yet.
10 Never?	I haven't felt like it.
11 But not even before, when he was living upstairs?	No.  I was living with you, remember? We've slept together but we haven't made love.  Not yet.  But I'll tell you one thing.  The sleeping together is better.
12 The sleeping together is better but not the sex because you haven't done it was him yet.	Will you please just go?

1 This is where you're supposed to say that you haven't laughed this much in ages, and then you see the error of your ways.	You make me laugh much more than Ray does, if that's what you're getting at.  But I already knew you could make me laugh.  It's everything else I don't know about.
2 You know I'm a good person.	Mmm hmm.
3 You know that I can cook my ass off when I feel like it.	Oh ho, so very infrequently.

1 I can see why you say that.  Look, I'm sorry.  I really am.  The last thing I wanted was... that's why I left, because... I lost it, and I didn't want to blow my top in there, and... look, the reason I fucked everything up was because I was scared.  I just wanted you to know, that's all.	Thank you.  I appreciate it.  I can't reciprocate.
2 What do you mean?	I didn't mess things up because I was scared.  I slept with Ray because I was sick of you.  And I needed something to snap me out of it.
3 Sure, I understand.  Look, I don't want to take up any more of your time.  You get back, and I'll wait here for a bus.	I don't want to go back.
4 What do you want to do?	C'mon.

1 Look, Rob.  If great sex was as important as you think it is, and if I was having great sex with him, then we wouldn't be lying here now. And that is my last word on the subject, okay?	Okay.

1 What are you going to talk to me about?	I'm going to talk to you about whether you want to get married or not.  To me.
2 Ha ha ha.  Hoo hoo hoo.	I mean it.
3 I know.	Oh, well thanks a fucking bunch.
4 I'm sorry.  But two days ago you were in love with that girl who interviewed you for The Reader, weren't you?	Not in love, exactly, but...
5 Well forgive me if I don't think of you as the world's safest bet.	Would you marry me if I was?
6 No.  Probably not.	Right.  Okay, then.  Shall we go?
7 Don't sulk.  What brought all this on?	I don't know.
8 Very persuasive.	Are you persuadable?
9 No.  I don't think so.  I'm just curious about how one goes from making tapes for one person to marriage proposals to another in two days. Fair enough?	Fair enough.
10 So?	I'm just sick of thinking about it all the time.
11 About what?	This stuff.  Love and marriage.  I want to think about something else.
12 I've changed my mind.  That's the most romantic thing I've ever heard. I do.  I will.	Shut up.  I'm only trying to explain.
13 I mean, maybe you're right.  But were you really expecting me to say yes?	I dunno.  Didn't think about it, really.  It was the asking that was the important thing.
14 Well, you've asked.

1 Hi, Marie.	Everything go alright?

1 Which way are you going?	That way.  You?
2 That way.	And so it is.  I'll talk to you later.
3 I'll call you.	Right.

1 Eno import.  Sigue Sigue Sputnik. Break beats.  Serge Gainsbourg. Ryuchi Sakamoto, Syd Barrett... What's going on here?  Are you guys stealing for other people now?	Naw.  Those are for us.
2 Oh really.  You two are slamming to Nico now?

1 I warned you.	Go to hell.

1 Do you play?	Yes.
2 Very traditional.

1 What will you do now?	You needn't worry Miss Cartwright. I've been at this a very long time.
2 He called you "MacLeod".	Not your concern.
3 I left a man dead in Felton.  But you don't really care, do you?	That bothers you?
4 He was innocent.	He's dead.  Whatever I may or may not feel means exceedingly little to him now.
5 What about me?	You?
6 I'm a witness to a murder.  That seems to put me pretty high on your friend's chop list.	Have you gone to the police?
7 No.	Why not?  I'm sure they'd love to hear your story.
8 I'd rather hear yours.	You are being foolish.
9 I'm a historian, Mr. Taupin. Only once in a lifetime do you stare history in the face.	Go home.

1 Maybe it would do us both good.	There's a catch.  You're supposed to wear 19th century clothing.

1 Don't.	Come here, Brenna.
2 Damn you.

1 Aren't you getting a little old for this?  You flunked out of law school.	Now there's a new topic.
2 Don't they have enough for you to do at the castle?

1 Hang on a sec, you did your little favor for the boys downtown, I'm sure your uncle and the rest are perfectly capable of taking it from here.	I've seen nobleman swords that weren't as well preserved.  It's just a hunk of peasant iron.  Why would he be carrying it around in an alley?

1 When I was a boy a cart driven by a drunken fool crushed me.  All thought I would die or be maimed for life.  But I healed quickly. And like you I paid the price for being different.	You are the same?
2 Do you ever feel a flow, as if some- thing were pushing against you?	Yes.  Always.
3 Does it change with me in the room?	It is less.
4 You feel you know me.	I don't know why.
5 We are brothers.

1 Impotent cow.	Muy Bien!

1 If you send me away now, Mara, I'll not come looking for you.	Do what you must.

1 Eat up Dupont.  It will probably be your last.	Not likely.

1 Here.  The hook should go just below the head, where the meat is toughest.	Thanks.

1 Old habits die hard.  Waitress!  A round of Nitzhic!  Peasant drool, I know.  But it's the closest thing they stock to my side of the fence.	What are you doing here?
2 It is the gathering, my friend.  The settling of old scores.

1 You've been here from the start.	My quarry grows clever with age.  And the others, incompetent.

1 Do you make a habit of hanging out in that neigh- borhood at night?	What are you getting at?
2 Let's just say that in my years with this department I've seen more than one well dressed business man look for a hand job on 14th Street.

1 Hello, Harvard! Got anything new on the hanging?	Why don't you fellows get your own news?

1 I got my rhyming dictionary in -- 	It doesn't have to rhyme!

1 All right, dear.	Wait a minute, Bruce. Have you got that money?
2 The five hundred? Sure.	On second thought, would you let me have it? I'll get the tickets.
3 But --	Believe me, Bruce, I know what I'm doing. He'd get you in a crap game --
4 But I don't gamble, Hilda!	I know a lot of men who didn't do anything till they met Walter Burns. Please, dear.
5 All right.  One -- two -- three -- four -- five. Five hundred. Be careful, honey.	I'll be careful, darling. You be, please.

1 Hildy! Where's mother?	Oh -- mother -- she -- I don't know where she went.
2 Did you give her the money?	No, I was going to give it to her -- but she left hurriedly.
3 Then suppose you give me the money. Four hundred and fifty dollars.	Oh, yes. Here it is.

1 I know I wasn't a good husband, Hildy, but you can always count on me.	I don't think she'll need you very much -- I aim to do most of the protecting myself.

1 I don't know. This makes me feel funny.	Why shouldn't I make Hildy my beneficiary? I've got nobody else to leave it to.
2 I feel I ought to take care of her.	Well, you'll take care of her. After all, if that doctor's right, I'm going to live for a long time yet. Look, Bruce, this is a debt of honor. I was a very bad husband: Hildy could have got a lot of alimony if she'd wanted to, but she wouldn't take any. She had it coming to her, but she was too independent.
3 Well, I'm independent, too.	Figure it this way: I ought to be good for twenty-five years. By that time, you'll probably have made enough so that the money won't mean anything. But suppose you haven't made good -- don't you think Hildy's entitled to a quiet old age without any worries?
4 Well, of course, if you put it that way.	And remember this, Bruce! I love her, too.
5 I'm beginning to realize that.	And the beauty of it is she'll never have to know 'till I've passed on. Maybe she'll think kindly of me --- after I'm gone.
6 Gee, you almost make me feel like a heel -- coming between you.	No, Bruce, you didn't come between us. It was all over for her before you came on the scene. For me -- it'll never be over.

1 I know how you feel, Bruce, but you've got to forgive her. She's only a woman, after all.	Suppose she is -- I have feelings, too! Do you know where I've been for the last couple of hours? Locked up in a police station and she didn't move to do anything about it.
2 Ts! Ts! Ts!	And now I don't know where my mother is. She may be lost.
3 I'll find her, Bruce, if I have to put every detective in the city on the job. Tell you what -- go over to the Missing Persons Bureau and describe your mother. What does she look like?	She's -- well, she's very motherly. That's about the best description I know.
4 That's the kind of stuff they want!

1 Call Duffy!	No, you don't!
2 Do you want to get us scooped?

1 Was it my fault? Did I know that coal mine was going to have another cave-in? I meant to be with you on our honeymoon, Hildy -- honest I did.	All I know is that instead of two weeks in Atlantic City with my bridegroom, I spent two weeks in a coal mine with John Kruptzky -- age sixty-three -- getting food and air out of a tube! You don't deny that. Do you?
2 Deny it! I'm proud of it! We beat the whole country on that story.	Well, suppose we did? That isn't what I got married for. What's the good of -- Look, Walter, I came up here to tell you that you'll have to stop phoning me a dozen times a day -- sending twenty telegrams -- all the rest of it, because I'm --
3 Let's not fight, Hildy. Tell you what. You come back to work on the paper and if we find we can't get along in a friendly way, we'll get married again.	What?!!
4 I haven't any hard feelings.	Walter, you're wonderful in a loathesome sort of way. Now, would you mind keeping quiet long enough for me to tell you what I came up here for?
5 Sure, come on. We'll have some lunch and you can tell me everything.	I have a lunch date. I just want --
6 You can break it, can't you?	No, I can't.
7 Sure you can. Come on.	Don't tell me what to do! We're divorced -- I'm a free woman. You're not my husband and you're not my boss! And what's more, you're not going to be my boss.
8 What do you mean by that?	Just what I said. That's what I --
9 You mean you're not coming back to work here?	That's the first time you've been right today. That's what I --
10 You've had a better offer, eh?	You bet I've got a better offer.
11 Well, go on and take it. Work for somebody else! That's the gratitude I get for --	I know, Walter, but I --
12 What were you when you came here five years ago? A little college girl from a School of Journalism! I took a little doll-faced mugg --	You wouldn't have taken me if I hadn't been doll-faced!
13 Why should I? I thought it would be a novelty to have a face around here a man could look at without shuddering.	Listen, Walter --
14 I made a great reporter out of you, Hildy, but you won't be half as good on any other paper, and you know it. You need me and I need you -- and the paper needs both of us.	Well, the paper'll have to learn to do without me. And so will you. It just didn't work out, Walter.
15 It would have worked if you'd been satisfied with just being editor and reporter. But no! You had to marry me and spoil everything.	I wasn't satisfied! I suppose I proposed to you!
16 Well, you practically did! Making goo-goo eyes at me for two years till I broke down. And I still claim I was tight the night I proposed. If you'd been a gentleman you'd have forgotten all about it. But not you!	You -- you --

1 What now?	His wife had twins and he went out to celebrate and got as drunk as a lord. They can't even find him.  I tell you, drink is the ruin of this nation.
2 You said it.	So -- Sweeney gets twins -- and Earl Williams gets hanged tomorrow.

1 Not if he's inside the desk. We'll carry the desk over.  Give me Duffy!	You can't take that desk out. It's crawling with cops outside.
2 We'll lower it out of the window with pulleys. Quit stallin'.

1 Bruce ought to be back by now. Walter, you're not trying anything again, are you?	Hildy, you think I could? After this story?  Here! You're just nervous.

1 Don't open that!	Who says so? I'm going to the morgue -- to look --

1 The greatest yarn ever written by anybody. My hat's off to you, Hildy!	Thanks.
2 And what a way to quit. While you're still champion! That's the way to leave, Hildy!	Yeah. Only -- only I'm not leaving, Walter.
3 What do you mean? Bruce'll be waiting for you in Albany.	No, he won't. I wired him that I wasn't coming.
4 Where'd you wire him?	On the nine o'clock train. That's the one he took, isn't it?
5 Sure.	It's awfully clear now. Bruce needs a wife who can give him a home -- and affection -- and peace. I couldn't do that for him, Walter. I'm what you made me -- a cheap reporter who'd give up her soul for a story!... Is that job still open?
6 Both jobs are open, Hildy. The paper -- and being Mrs. Walter Burns.	Thanks, Walter, but it's no good. We tried it.
7 Sure, it was good -- it was wonderful! Only you expected it to be like other marriages. It can't be like other marriages -- we're different! We're a different world. Look at what we went through today. I wouldn't trade that for any honeymoon in the world. I bet you wouldn't, either.	A fine honeymoon, with a murderer right in the boudoir! And that other honeymoon in a coal mine!
8 That's what makes it romantic. Every other married couple goes away on a honeymoon and for two weeks the bride knows just where the groom is, and vice versa. But us -- you never know where I am and I'm not sure where you are. That's Romance!	Well, maybe I'd like to know just once!
9 Hildy, if that's what you want, all right. We'll even go to -- how about Niagara Falls?	Niagara Falls! Walter, you don't mean that?
10 Sure I do. And I'll tell you something else -- I'd like a baby.	Walter!
11 Sure, I can't last forever. I want a son I can train to take my place on this paper.	What would you do if it was a daughter?
12 Well, if she looked like you -- Say! My brains and your looks -- that mightn't be such a bad combination.	What's the matter with my brains?
13 What's the good of arguing about something that probably doesn't exist? Look, Hildy, I'm proposing to you. What do you say?	Well, I'd like to be lady-like and think it over.
14 I don't want to rush you. Take a couple of seconds.

1 Down Western Avenue. We were going sixty-five miles an hour. You know what I mean?	Take that mush out of your mouth!

1 Cooley, I want to talk to you.	Hildy -- I can't. I'm busy -- I -- Let me up, Hildy. Earl Williams has escaped --

1 Well, that about covers everything.	Good. Now I want to ask you fellows a couple of questions. Did Earl Williams know what he was doing when he fired that gun?

1 Better let us in on it, Mollie.	Aw, why don't you let her alone? She's ill!

1 Oh, you two are pals now -- I think you're right, Endicott. Mollie did give her some kind of story.	I tell you, it's a screwy set-up. We better hold onto 'em both.

1 Oh -- I'll take the same, I guess. And coffee.	Little rum in yours, too?
2 I guess so.

1 Johnson, I'm going to the bottom of this. What do you know about Williams? Are you going to talk or aren't you?	What do I know about Williams?
2 All right, boys. Take her along. I got ways of making her talk.

1 Well, wait a minute, will you? I'm in conference.	No, I couldn't do that.

1 No -- don't out me off.	How would you like to have a job for three hundred and fifty dollars a month. That's almost a hundred dollars a week!

1 And so do I!	So do you what, you hoodoo!  And now, Mr. Pinkus, if you'll come with us, we'll take you over to the Warden's office and deliver this reprieve.

1 Nobody's going to rush me into anything!  You keep away from me! 	All right, Judge.

1 Hello, Hildy. I thought you were gone.	I thought so, too.

1 Hiding him where?	Mother!

1 Maybe you're my friend and maybe you're not -- but don't come any nearer. You can't trust anybody in this crazy world. Say, I'll bet I could shoot you from here.	Sure you could, Earl -- but you wouldn't want to do that, would you? You wouldn't want to kill anybody.
2 No, no, you're right. I don't want to kill anybody. All I want to do is be let alone.

1 What's that?	Quiet, Mollie!
2 There's somethin' funny going on around here.

1 Now, listen. There's a fine opening for a fellow like you in the City Sealer's office.	The what?
2 The City Sealer's office!	You mean here in the city?
3 Yes, yes!

1 Sure, Mollie, you never looked better in your life.	Yeah, hold the line. Hey, this looks good. An old lady just called the detective bureau and claims Williams is hiding in her cellar. Well - we've looked every other place. Want to go out on it?

1 Can I try?	Put your hand on mine, get the knack of it.

1 What are you doing here? This is our territory	Looking for shrapnel.

1 Tell them about Pauline's mum.	Not now. They wouldn't believe me.

1 Crocodiles! Aah!	The sodding water table.

1 Could you seal it over with hot pitch, Clive? Caulk it like the hull of a ship.	Thanks. I hope you can come for the launching.

1 Don't panic!  Keep your head!	I will if you will!

1 You mean they let you go through the officer training course and then said you were too old for a commission?	That's it.
2 Why didn't they say that before you started?	I wasn't too old when I started the course. I was too old when it finished.
3 What are you going to be then?	A clerk. I'm doing a typing course. I'll be typing for England.

1 And where do you think you're going?	Out.
2 You go to bed this minute and take off that lipstick.	No, I won't.

1 ...such nice boys with straw boaters and blazers. All the punts lit up with Chinese lanterns. Like fireflies. And the gramophone going on one of the boats. Always the Charleston, the Charleston, the Charleston. Oh, you girls.	Wasn't it lovely?

1 He could always make me laugh.	We did the decent thing.
2 This war's put an end to decent things. I want to close my eyes and jump and give myself for once, hold nothing back.	We can't change what's past. Not even the war can do that.
3 We did all the proper things, and we lost love. That's sad, Mac.

1 Molly!	Well! I'm not talking about Mac. He hasn't toughed me for ages. And not often ever. My life started when Mac went on nights.

1 Ma, Tiny's in.	Go tell him to get your Grandpa.

1 OK, whatever. Let's go get your brother's truck. Faster we get the truck, faster we get out of here.	OK.

1 I'd like to see that.	Nice.

1 No, really.	Shit, I don't remember exactly. I took over for my Pa just after the Duke nabbed the Oscar.
2 The Duke?	Yeah, my Pa wasn't right in the head after that.
3 You mean John Wayne?	Hell, boy there some other Duke you know about?  A great American.
4 Yeah, I was never that big of a western fan. I like science fiction.	I figured that much. Why the fuck you asking so many jackass questions for?
5 You see me and my friends are writing a book on offbeat roadside attractions. You know all the crazy shit you see when you drive cross country.	I don't drive cross country.
6 But if you did.	I don't.
7 But suppose for a second you did.	Y'all find us country people real funny like don't ya... well, God damn pack up the mule and sling me some grits, I'ze a gotta get me some schooling.
8 No, no I think it's really interesting.	Well fuck me Side Sally, who want to read about all that horse shit anyway.

1 What was that?	Fuck. I think we blew a tire.

1 Fuck! We are fucked!	Turn that fucking radio off!

1 Sounds like a magical trip through the heartland.	Where ya headed?

1 How much is a person supposed to stand?	Quiet.
2 Oh, I'm sorry, bothering you? Was I disturbing your viewing pleasure?

1 No, he's just joking. We don't really have any plans other than spending the night at my Dad's house...  ...which is where we were headed when our car broke down.	That's nice.
2 Yeah, I guess I'll just help him hand out candy to the trick or treaters.

1 Fuck, it's freezing.	Hey, listen to this... I think this is related to our Dr. Satan.
2 Oh, yeah.	Yeah, in this book there's a chapter called Self Made Freaks about how people would mutilate themselves in order to work in a freak show. It mostly talks about tattooed people and wild men of Borneo and shit like that, but there is one mention of a single case where a woman was suspected of having her arms removed on purpose to become an arm-less wonder.
3 Yeah, so how does that fit with the story of four morons with a flat tire looking for a dead tree?	It says, "records show that Ellie Thompson was born in 1914 of normal physical stature and lived a life of normal bearings, until such time that she was placed in the care of the Willows State Mental Facility."
4 So.	Now she was put in the nuthouse in 1930 at the age of 16.
5 Why?	Blah, blah, blah... it doesn't say, but she was released sometime in 1937, only to reappear as Ellie Bogdan, the arm-less wonder. Says she, "criss-crossed the United States constantly in carnivals and freak shows until her death in 1946."
6 Yeah?	These dates perfectly correspond with the time frame of our beloved Dr. Satan working at the looney bin. I'll bet he amputated her arms.
7 So what?	I don't know, I just thought it was interesting.
8 You know what Jerry, who really cares at this point?	I don't...  ...I just thought it was weird.

1 Come on sleeping beauty, time to go to work.	Sleeping.
2 Rise and shine.	No please, let me sit this one out.
3 Let's go. You're the one who wanted to be a photographer.	I resign.
4 Too late. You're in for life, let's move it out Private Shutterbug.	Christ, I hope this isn't more crappy folk art. It's so quaint... it's so primal... it's so crap.
5 Aw, it ain't crap... it's... cute.  ...and really who are we to judge the artistic merit of the tin-can Mona Lisa?	Aw, shit...  I gotta pee anyway.

1 What was that?	What? I didn't hear anything.
2 Wait... quiet. Turn off the radio.

1 So, what brings you kids way out here, ain't you got something better to do for Halloween than wander around out here in the sticks?	Well, I thought I'd maybe take in a hoedown.
2 Oh, really...  ...well, I'm a pretty good dancer if you know what I mean... I bet I got a few moves you ain't never seen.	I don't doubt that.

1 God damn it, I must be fucking crazy to let him go off with that crazy fucking bitch.	Huh?
2 That stupid hillbilly slut.	Oh, don't blow everything out of proportion.
3 You didn't see the look she threw me. She's up to something.

1 Behold... The Fish-Boy!	This can't be real, this can't be real, this can't be real.
2 Oh, it's real... as real as I want it to be, mamma...  ...look, see the magic in my brush strokes.

1 I'm the one who brings the devil's brandy... 	Who's your Daddy!
2 Yes! I'm the one who beats you when you're bad...

1 Tell it to my daughter.	Shit... fuck procedure.

1 Plates match.	Call the chief... We found 'em.

1 Tell him, Harold.	Son, your mother and I are doing a production of The Gin Game at the local community theater. We forgot to take off our make-up.

1 No. Don't be. I really enjoy hearing that. You're a terrific assistant.	Merci. I... Do you... would you like to go get a cup of coffee, perhaps?
2 Well, I don't know. I'm actually on my way to...	Now I am truly embarrassed. Forgive me. I should not have asked such a stupid question. I know you are a very important man and...
3 No. Don't be silly. It's just...	I am a foolish little thing. I am pink in my face, no? It is only that I have been so lonely lately and... I am ashamed. I'll see you tomorrow, okay? Unless... Am I fired now?

1 Yeah. Okay. Be home around seven. Bye.  What? I'm sorry. What was I supposed to do?	I don't know, Nathan. What are you supposed to do?
2 You don't abandon somebody because they have a physical problem.	Funny. I thought that's exactly what you did. You just don't have the courage to admit it to yourself.

1 Well?	God, you're beautiful.
2 Please. I look a mess.	No. You look so beautiful.
3 Anyway. Come already to the point.	I'm... I'm going to leave Lila. I can't stop thinking about you.
4 I've moved on.	No!
5 I've been seeing Johannsen in chemistry.	That goddamn Neanderthal? I'm the one who gave him the idea for the combination bug spray-sun screen! Did you know that?!
6 That's not how he tells it.	Of course not, that Swedish thief! He's a thief of hearts!  I love you, Gabrielle.
7 Hunh.	Just give me some time to let Lila down easily. She's a really nice girl and I don't want to hurt her more than is necessary.
8 You hurt me, you know, when you made Nathan's Choice. Does that not even matter to you, you pig?

1 Very well.	Very well.

1 How'd you know where I was?	Nathan told my brother.
2 Your brother should have his license revoked.	Yeah, although I'm not going to turn him in. I like hearing the dirt.
3 Why didn't your brother tell you that Nathan was having an affair?

1 Boy, this is good!	I'm sorry that I became so upset.
2 No, I'm sorry. I'm really backward in certain areas.	It's only that I really enjoy your company and...
3 You do?	Yes, and...
4 You really enjoy my company?	Yes.  Please don't talk with food in your mouth, Lila. Please. You're so pretty and it only mars your... I'm sorry. I'm being critical.

1 Come on.	If it's a person, why should we go see it? It's not like it's nature or anything. It's just a person.  Sometimes people who live in the woods don't want to be seen. They live in the woods because they're anti-social, Lila. We have to respect that.

1 Everything's fine, honey. We don't need to talk. Besides I have to work late.	Please, Nathan. I really need this. You've been working late a lot.

1 I'm going to go down and check on Puff. See how he's holding up.	Should I come with?
2 Nah. You just relax. How's the book?	Ummm. It's good.

1 Did I? I tried so hard! I really concentrated! Oh, I'm so happy!	And because you did so well, we have a little surprise for you.
2 Extra dessert?	Even better.

1 Wait!	Yes?
2 I saw you on C-Span. I've been looking for you for thirty years. Then there you were, such a beautiful, beautiful grown man.

1 You sure you going to be comfortable enough there, Miss... ah... ?	Packard. Sarah Packard.
2 It always takes me a little while to get a name fixed in my mind. Are you sure you don't want anything?	No, I'm fine.
3 You, uh, you ever been to Louisville during Derby week, Miss, ah, Packard?	I've never been to Louisville.
4 Lots of action. Lots of money.  Lots of class. You'll see some of the best-dressed and most beautiful women in the world at the races. Knock your eye out.

1 In a little while. That's what you want, isn't it?	It's what Eddie wants. He, uh, told me to give you some money.

1 Hey, mister.	The name's Gordon. Bert Gordon.
2 Mister. You been sittin' in that spot for hours. Would you mind moving? It bothers me.

1 Sarah Packard... Bert Gordon.	Miss Packard. How do you do?

1 What's the matter? What happened?	It's all right. She had a little too much to drink, that's all. Forget it.  Go upstairs and sleep it off.

1 Eddie?...  YOU OWE ME MONEY!	And just how do you figure that, Bert? What do you figure I owe you?
2 Half.	In Louisville it was seventy-five per cent.
3 Well, here it's half.	What if I don't pay ya, Bert?
4 You don't pay me? You gonna get your thumbs broken.  And your fingers. And if I want them to, your right arm in three or four places.

1 It's quiet.	Yeah, like a church. Church of the Good Hustler.
2 Looks more like a morgue to me. Those pool tables are the slabs they lay the stiffs on.	I'll be alive when I get out, Charlie.

1 Oh, I don't want to be no bother to nobody.	Oh, don't play it small, Charlie. It don't look good on you.
2 How do you want me to play it? I'm broke.	So am I... Sit down.  Would you get us a couple of drinks?

1 I thought we came here to play pool.	I don't play pool, Mr. Felson. I play billiards. My house, my game. You don't have to play if you don't want to.

1 You sure you don't want to quit, friend?	Let's cut out the small stuff, huh? Hundred dollar freeze-out. Ten games, ten bucks a game, winner take all. And then we'll see who quits.
2 Okay, friend. You're on.	Call it.
3 Heads.

1 It's the lights. And the scotch.	How come you didn't catch your bus?
2 I wasn't waiting for a bus.	Then why go to the bus station?
3 Same reason you went: at that hour of the morning you haven't much choice. Besides, I only live three blocks from there. Where do you live?	Around.
4 I know where you live: in a locker, in a bus station. What's it like living in a locker?	Cramped.  You always drink like this, so early in the morning?
5 Do you always ask so many questions?	No, not always.
6 Sometimes I wake up and I can't sleep, not without a drink. The bars don't open until eight. Mack over there has faith in me. When I'm broke, he trusts me. Don't you trust me, Mack?

1 I'm hungry.	Take your choice. I've got enough so we won't have to go out of the house till Tuesday.
2 What did all this stuff cost you?	When you've got money, you'll pay.
3 No, c'mon, I wanna know. I wanna keep score.	The bills are right here. You didn't say what you wanted.
4 Don't you ever cook anything?	Eggs. How do you like them?
5 Raw.

1 You can read it, if you want to.  You want to go out for a while? To a movie?	You wanna drink?
2 No. You?	What's it so hot in here for?

1 Where's Bert?	He went off someplace.
2 Well, that old lovin' horse paid twenty-two forty.  Let's see... two hundred I won from the jockey last night. And today at the track... I got five hundred and forty bucks.  Here, you hold it.	Why?
3 Just for luck.

1 Preach! Go down and get me some White Tavern whisky, a glass, and some ice.	Preacher! Go on down and get me some bourbon. J. T. S. Brown. No ice, no glass.
2 Preach... get it at Johnny's.  You got a bet.

1 How much do you remember?	It comes back.  Flashes.  My name.

1 Will you keep feeding me?  How long can you live like that?  Until it kills you?  Until I kill you? Without your blood I'll go back.	We don't know that --
2 I know it.  What do you want, Robert?

1 The more we plant, the more that'll grow, and the happier --	Virginia...?
2 What?

1 A meteorite, Dad, look!	It's that time of year again. We should get a pretty good show out here.
2 Why, Dad?	Because the sky is so clear out here.

1 I had an awful dream.	What, Jim, what?
2 First lemme look at your necks.

1 We'll be by to pick him up in ten minutes.	Yes, Mr. Gardner.

1 I swear it was here.	But it's not, Jimmy.
2 No.	Let's go look at the sand pit behind your house.

1 You're looking for life?	They didn't find any signs of life on the Viking missions.

1 Ms. Magnuson, is Jimmy Gardner with you?	Why, yes.
2 Jimmy's father is on the phone.  I wonder if you'd take the call.	All right.  I'll be right back.

1 You still believe in him.	He's a good man.
2 Better be. You left me for him.	I wanted a career. Didn't you ever want to be part of something special?

1 You saved a lot of lives.	I could have evacuated the cities hours ago.  You know, when I flew in the Gulf War everything is simple. We knew what we had to do. It's not simple anymore, Connie. A lot of people died today. How many didn't have to?

1 Okay, why did I just send my family to Atlanta?	Remember I told you that the signal hidden within our satellite signal is slowly recycling down to extinction.
2 Not really...	That signal. It's a countdown.
3 A countdown to what?	Think. It's like in chess. First you strategically position your pieces. Then, when the timing's right. You strike.

1 Sure he'll listen. Why wouldn't he?	Because last time I saw him I punched him in the face.
2 You punched the President in the face?	He wasn't the President then.

1 Get us out of here!	I can't shake her free.

1 And our forces?	We're down to approximately fifteen percent, Sir.  If you calculate the time it takes them to destroy a city and move on, we're looking at world wide destruction of every major city within the next thirty six hours.
2 We're being exterminated.

1 More ships keep arriving, fifteen in total so far.	This is crazy. We're loosing our first strike capabilities!
2 We're trying to communicate with them on all frequencies but we're getting nowhere. Atlantic Command is working on a type of visual communication.

1 You're late.	You know how I like to make a big entrance.

1 That is an affirmative. I have victory dance. Mmmmmmm.	Don't get premature on me, Jimmy. We don't light up 'til the Fat Lady sings.
2 I hear you.

1 They let you out?	Just what the hell do you think you're doing?

1 Call them back.	The other bombers might have more luck. We shouldn't just give up...
2 I said call them back.

1 Yes.	Papers, sir. Got it here.

1 Do you believe the Grail actually exists?	The search for the Cup of Christ is the search for the divine in all of us.

1 Indy... Indy, you must hurry!! Come quickly!	It's... a leap of faith. Oh, God.

1 Are you expected?	Don't take that tone with me, my good man. Now buttle off and tell Baron Brunwald that Lord Clarence MacDonald and his lovely assistant are here to view the tapestries.
2 Tapestries?	Dear me, the man is dense. This is a castle, isn't it? There are tapestries?
3 This is a castle. And we have many tapestries. But if you're a Scottish lord, then I am Mickey Mouse.	How dare he?!

1 I'm through!	We're through!

1 It must be one of these...	Look at the artistry of these carvings and the scrollwork.

1 This one. I think he's in here.	How do you know?

1 It is you Junior!	Don't call me that, please.
2 But what are you doing here?	I came to get you! What do you think?

1 What am I looking for?	My lucky charm.
2 Feels like a cigarette lighter.	Try and burn through the ropes.

1 What did you get?	I don't know. The first available flight out of Germany.
2 Good.

1 Those people are trying to kill us!	I know, Dad!
2 It's a new experience for me.	It happens to me all the time.

1 Elsa never really believed in the Grail. She thought she'd found a prize.	What did you find, Dad?
2 Me?... Illumination.

1 Sallah, I said no camels! That's five camels. Can't you Count?	Compensation for my brother-in-law's car. Indy, your father and Brody --
2 Where's my father?	They have them. In the belly of that steel beast.

1 You're hanging on better here than you did in America.	This is a different situation, Dr. Jones. These people are like children. We have to lead them slowly into the twentieth century.

1 The plane crash and your journey here sound -- most incredible.	You should have been there...

1 Their stories are just fear and folklore.	Maybe... but how do you explain The Thuggee shrine I saw right below the palace?

1 What's that?	A bonus, Dr. Jones. That is poison. You just drank the rest of it.

1 He was afraid of you. He knows a tough guy when he sees one.	Yeah, that's what happened...

1 That's far enough!	You are in no position to give orders, Dr. Jones.

1 Look out, damn it, I need that antidote!	Who cares? Where's that diamond!

1 India...	Holy cow -- India? How do you know we're in --

1 Don't let it pull you deeper!	It's pulling me deeper!
2 Don't let it curl around you!	It's curling around me! Damn it, stop talking and do something!

1 The drawing shows a priest named Sankara who lived centuries ago.	What does the writing say?
2 It's Sanskrit. It tells the story of Sankara climbing Mt. Kalisa where he met the Hindu god Shiva.	That's Shiva? What's he giving the Priest?
3 Legend says he told Sankara to go forth and combat evil. To do that he gave him five sacred stones that had magical powers.	You mean magical like the rock that was stolen from that village?

1 Yeah -- and nothing else.  That shock you?	I'm a scientist. I like doing research on certain "nocturnal activities" --

1 There's bugs! Bugs all over! Help! Help me!	Willie, open the door! GET US OUT OF HERE!

1 What?	You've got to go to sleep now.
2 I want to go home...	I don't blame you... this hasn't been what you'd call a fun vacation...

1 This is the first time anybody ever cried when I left.	They don't cry about you. They cry about the elephants leaving.
2 Figures...	They got no food to feed them. So they taking the elephants away to sell them.

1 Al.	Yes?
2 This candid camera?

1 What are you doing?	Loading a gun.
2 What for?	Kill myself.
3 Are you crazy?	Yep.
4 Don't do it.  Don't aim at the head.	Used to be, things were bad. No job...no money...no girl. Now I got all that and I'm crazy too.
5 You're not crazy.	Hear voices don't I.
6 Of course you do!	Then I'm crazy.

1 What do I do?	Outrun them.
2 This is a Fiesta!

1 They could put you back in the tube..	I'd be helpless and useless. They don't have the PEM. Without that...there's no chance.
2 Well...they sure as hell aren't gonna get it for you.	They're busy covering their asses. They're not the type of people we need."
3 Yeah...Who is?	I am. You are.
4 You are CRAZY!	You're the one talking to a little guy in your head.  ...We'll have to do it on our own.
5 What do you mean we.	You gotta help.
6 I did. I brought you back here.	We're a team...My...talent. Your... mobility.
7 Thanks.	Think of the scientific data we'll gain. Come on, lets get out of here.
8 I'm not leaving until you do.

1 You need ID in there?	You do. To get out of here. You're gonna be me.
2 I don't wanna be you. I wanna go home.	You can't go home. When UST finds we're gone, they'll come after you and put us away.

1 ...and a license to kill...	Well, if not to kill, then to bother and annoy.

1 Al, are you doing anything in there?	What? What do you mean?
2 Are you screwing with any nerves?

1 Where is she staying?	Where are you staying?

1 Much too blue.	Not blue enough.

1 Follow that busboy.	Are you serious?

1 What Happened?	I don't know!
2 What she say. What'd you get out of her?

1 Come on, she's getting away.	I can't keep up.

1 I can't...	You have to! Quickly!
2 ...imagine a better grape for the region.

1 You sure this will work?	Not sure at all.
2 Well at least talk it up, then. I feel like an idiot.	Just say the words. Just like I told you.

1 Holy...	...Shit! It's just money.

1 Not really. Truth is...I was ..jealous. Of you.	Thing is...I think I'm in love with her.
2 Oh no!

1 JOE What abilities...?	Face it, we're the men for the job. Besides, if someone is really chasing you, the best way to avoid them is to keep moving ...and FIND THE GODDAMN PEM.

1 I'm against it.	I insist.

1 Impossible.	I'll prove it. We'll repeat their procedures...put a man in our POD, bring it down, and then...inject him.

1 Who is your friend?	We met on the beach.
2 Join us.

1 Joe.	What?
2 Take the card.	Oh yeah, thanks...

1 Don't do it!	Just give me the keys.
2 Whatever it is, don't do it.

1 ...Blake	Blake?
2 The poet...something he said...	Yes?

1 I guess it's a combination you don't often see. Apparent attraction..	It's not apparent.
2 ...and sort of...disinterest.	Disinterest?
3 As if your mind's not all there.	I am sort of scattered.
4 Can I help?	You are.
5 Are you alright?

1 You don't believe me.	Oh sure.
2 Then why are you smiling like that?	Lots of my clients are rich guys... They like danger..like playing with drugs and things...running around, acting mysterious.
3 You think I'm like that?

1 Why'd you ask him.	He's a client of mine! What's the matter. You can't suspect Dieter. He's a famous photographer. He makes millions.
2 Maybe I'm wrong. Then GRUNER won't be here.

1 I'm sorry I got you into this.	It was my choice.

1 Who are you? Who do you work for?	Doesn't matter. I'm on your side.
2 I knew it. I told him.	Now what?
3 We just don't stop.

1 I can't. He didn't do anything. Thanks to you.	Why are you on to him?
2 We've had thefts of our new stuff ...GRUNER deals in this... A big deal is going down now. I went to see if GRUNER had anything to sell. But he didn't make any moves...And when you arrived, he backed off.	Why'd you invite me here?
3 Someone is selling. You followed us. If it's not him, it must be you. If it's not you, it must be him... You scared him off.	What about the others.
4 I don't know.

1 What'd he say, how's he know about Al?	What does he know?
2 Too much.

1 Let me tell you something, Lowell. Look, look, look. You're talking about two agents in a regional office in Louisville. I got the goddamn Unabomber threatening to blow up LAX! I gotta move 45 agents from all over the country into L.A.  Alright? When I get a chance, I'll give it a look...	You better take a good look! Because I'm getting two things: pissed off and curious! Now, any of these guys been offered jobs in corporate security after they retire? Either one of those guys have ex-agent pals already in those jobs? Like, for instance, their ex-supervisor, who's already at Brown & Williamson as we fucking speak?

1 When's the air date?	Excuse me, Lowell. Sharon's on line 3.
2 Tell her I'll call her back in ten.

1 Yeah, I heard rumors.	It's not a rumor. It's a sale.  If Tisch can unload CBS for $81 a share to Westinghouse and then is suddenly threatened with a multibillion-dollar lawsuit from Brown & Williamson, that could screw up the sale, could it not?

1 A gun? Yes.	What caliber is your gun?
2 What caliber is my gun?	Yes, sir. What caliber is your gun?
3 What does that have to do with the price of tea in China?

1 What does that mean? "Rife with -- ?"	I'm told unusual promises were made to Wigand.
2 No, only that we would hold the story until it was safe for him...	And, I'm told there are questions as to our "star witness'" veracity.
3 His "veracity" was good enough for the State of Mississippi.	Our standards have to be higher than anyone else's, because we are the standard... for everyone else...

1 I'm sorry, darling, have you seen my coffee mug...?	Try the car.

1 Will independent sources corroborate that?	Hello? Yeah...

1 Yes, I'm right here. Could you call me back on a hard line?	Alright.
2 Area code 212-555-0199.	I'll call you then.

1 Okay, let's look through the looking glass the other way...	What do you mean?
2 We got a guy... who wants to talk but he's constrained.  What if he were "compelled"?	Oh, torture? Great ratings.

1 Did I get you up?	No, I usually sit around in my hotel room, dressed like this at 5:30 in the morning, sleepy look on my face.

1 How do you like your coffee? Black?	Black, black...

1 And, I'm unemployed. So I have to protect my medical coverage.  ...so I left them a message this morning. Their expanded confidentiality agreement? I will sign it.	They're afraid of you, aren't they?
2 They should be.

1 The internet said you did graduate work in Wisconsin, then went to UC La Jolla with Professor... Marcus?	Marcuse. Yeah. He was my mentor. He had a major influence on the New Left in the late '60s... and on me, personally.
2 Next to your father?	My father? What the hell's that got to do with my father?
3 Is that why you became a journalist? Then you get to ask all the questions?	You charge by the hour?
4 My father was a mechanical engineer... most ingenious man I ever knew.	Well, my father left us when I was five-years old. He was not the most ingenious man I ever knew... Let's get back to Brown & Williamson. If you decide to go on "60 Minutes," I got to know everything about why you got fired.
5 Why?	They're gonna dig up stuff from your past, they're gonna throw it at you. I got to know what they're gonna throw. You understand?
6 I drink. A couple of occasions more than I should have.  I was cited for shoplifting once. But it was a mistake...  I pushed Liane one time. We were both stressed out because of the pressure. She went to her mother's.  I got fired because when I get angry I have difficulty censoring myself. And I don't like to be pushed around!	I'm not pushing you around!  I'm asking you questions.
7 I'm just a commodity to you, aren't I? I could be anything. Right? Anything worth putting on between commercials...	...to a network, probably, we're all commodities.  To me? You are not a commodity. What you are is important.

1 "Part of the reason I'm here is I felt that their representation clearly, at least within..."	Run that Sandefur piece on "nicotine's not addictive." Run that on-camera. Then cut right to Wigand with "I believe they perjured..." Then go wide to the CEOs all taking the oath. Back on Jeff and play the pause after the word "felt" on the B-side...

1 Where are you, anyway?	I'm on a leave of absence. Forced vacation.
2 You try and have a good time.	Yeah. Yeah, I will.

1 I heard you. But I got to arrange a legal defense first. I got to get you to testify in court, get it on public record.	Then hold it off the air until you got that. But I want to go to New York. And I want to go on the record. Right now!

1 Jail?	Possibly, yes. That is one of the possible consequences of your testifying here today. That's right...
2 How does one... "go... to... jail?" What does my family do? Go on welfare? If my wife has to work? Who's going to look after the kids? Put food on the table? My children need me. If I'm not teaching... there's no medical... no medical... even on co- pay, that's like... Tuition...

1 As you are well aware, my previous marriage ended with an unjustified strain on my reputation My motives were questioned. I was slandered in court.	You did good, Massey!
2 Therefore in an effort to remove any trace of suspicion from my sweet Howard -- I wish to execute a pre- nuptial agreement.	And -- there's no talking her out of it. Believe me, I've tried.
3 They say the Massey pre-nup has never been penetrated.	She said "penetrate." Heh heh heh.

1 Excuse me, Mr. Doyle, if I could just borrow your charming fiancee for a moment.	What part?
2 I'd just like to have a word with her.	Why not? I'm going to have her for a lifetime.

1 Who's next, Mrs. Rabinow.	We rest, Your Honor.
2 Mr. Massey?

1 She's rich. We're still married. We have no pre-nup.	So, that's good, right?

1 Is Tong older than Ming?	I think Ming is older than Tong.  What is this?

1 I'll have the tournedos of beef. And the lady will have the same?  I assume you're a carnivore.	I know you do.

1 I'd like to offer my congratulations. That was a beautiful gesture of Howard's.	Howard is a beautiful person.
2 Yes. He's a diamond in the rough. And I have a feeling that someday soon you'll be taking that diamond and leaving the rough.	Miles. Miles. Miles.
3 I am thrilled for you, but tell me this... How'd you get Howard to do it? I've addressed enough juries to appreciate the power of suggestion, but it seemed like he thought it was his own idea.	It was his idea. It was a gesture of love and trust. Be happy for me, Miles.
4 Well, when this goes south -- promise you'll have dinner with me?	Have you tried the duck?
5 I figure a couple of months. That's how long it should take for the ink on the settlement to dry.

1 Friends?	Don't go. Stay with me for a while.

1 Hi.	Hello Marylin.
2 I have a surprise for you.	I bet.

1 Wait! He works for YOU?	Now. But first, he worked for you.
2 You were going to have this thug...?	Wait just a second there. You sent him here. You unearthed this pestilence.

1 Have you been taking your digestive enzymes?	Sometimes I forget.

1 Maybe.	We do have a man for you.

1 But Marylin, without this, you're completely exposed.	I want to be exposed.

1 What?!	Oh, just a routine mammogram. She said to say hello. She's going to Positano with your brother's family.

1 Time marches on. Ardor cools.	No. Not exactly. It didn't exactly cool. Marylin is a knock-out. And very sexy -- but -- there's a lot of it out there.
2 Ah.	You know what I mean when I say "it."
3 Gotcha. No need to get anatomically correct with me, Rex.	Seems like there's more of it than ever before --
4 Well, with the expanding global population -- Let me ask you this -- your wife. Has she pursued the opportunities which must present themselves to the "knock-out, sexy woman" you described?	I don't know. I can assume...
5 Not in court you can't. Has she retained counsel?	I'm not sure.
6 And your wife is aware of or has evidence of your activities?	Video.
7 Mmm... And to cut to the chase, forensically speaking -- is there a pre-nup?

1 Wrigley?	Miles.
2 Kenneth this is my associate, Wrigley. Wrigley this is my friend, Dr. Beck.	The plastic surgeon! I read about you in LA Style.
3 Do you have it?

1 Divorce was her childhood aspiration?	Well, not just divorce. She used to say "I want to be divorced from some big dumb rich guy..." And I guess her dream is coming true.  I'm happy for you Patty

1 Mr. Warne?	Yeah.
2 Come in. Sit down.

1 Your whole life is devoted to just one thing. To accumulate more money. At least there's romance in what he's doing.	He's no good, Ellie, and you know it. You married him only because I told you not to.
2 You've been telling me what not to do since I was old enough to remember.  I'm sick of it!

1 On a hunger strike, huh?  When'd she eat last?	She hasn't had a thing yesterdayor today.
2 Been sending her meals in regularly?	Yessir. She refuses them all.
3 Why didn't you jam it down her throat?	It's not quite that simple.  I've dealt with prisoners in my time, but this one
4 Absurd!  All this fuss over a snip of a girl.  I'm going down to see her myself.

1 Don't want to talk todon't want to talk to anybody. Don't want to see anybody.	But it's King Westley on the phone.
2 Ooooooh.  Hello my would-be ex-son-in-law. I've sent you a check for a hundred thousand. Yes. That's the smartest thing you ever did, Westley, not to contest that annulment. That's satisfactory, isn't it? Yeah. Well, it ought to be. Oh I'm not complaining. It was dirt cheap.  Don't fall out of any windows.	There's another wire from Peter, sir. They're in Glen Falls, Michigan.
3 "What's holding up the annulment, you slow poke? The Walls of Jericho are toppling."  Send him a telegram right away. Just say: "Let 'em topple."

1 Driver!	Yeah?
2 These seats accommodate two passengers, don't they?	Maybe they doand maybe they don't.

1 You'll never get away with it, Miss Andrews. 	What are you talking about?
2 Just a spoiled brat of a rich man. You and Westley'll make an ideal team.	Will you please tell me what you're raving about!
3 You'll never get away with it, Miss Andrews. Your father'll stop you before you get half way to New York.	You must have me confused with
4 Quit kidding!  It's all over the front pages, You know, I've always been curious about the kind of a girl that would marry King Westley.

1 That, I suppose, makes everythinguhquite all right.	Oh, this?I like privacy when I retire. I'm very delicate in that respect. Prying eyes annoy me.  Behold the walls of Jericho![4] Maybe not as thick as the ones that Joshua blew down with his trumpet, but a lot safer. You see, I have no trumpet.  Now just to show you my heart's in the right place, I'll give you my best pair of pajamas.

1 Well, I hope you're not going to dictate whom I can talk to.	I know a couple of truck drivers I'd like to have you meet sometime.  Come on, sit down.
2 Thank you.  My, my! Scrambled eggs.	Egg. One eggdoughnutsblack coffee. That's your ration till lunch. Any complaints?
3 Nope. No complaints.	I'd have gotten you some cream but it meant buying a whole pint.
4 Why, you don't have to apologize, Mr. Warne. You'll never know how much I appreciate all this.	What makes you so disgustingly cheerful this morning?
5 Must be the Spring.	I thought maybeuh"believe you me" told you a couple of snappy stories.
6 He apologized for last night.  Said he didn't know we were married.	Just shows you how wrong a guy can be. Doughnut?
7 Thanks.  You think this whole business is silly, don't you? I mean running away and everything.	No. No. It's too good a story.
8 Yes, you do. You think I'm a fool and a spoiled brat. Perhaps I am, although I don't see how I can be. People who are spoiled are accustomed to having their own way. I never have. On the contrary, I've always been told what to do and how to do it and where and with whom. Would you believe it? This is the first time I've ever been alone with a man!	Yeah?
9 It's a wonder I'm not panic stricken.	Um. You're doing all right.
10 Thanks. Nurses, governesses, chaperones, even body-guards. Oh, it's been a lot of fun.	One consolation; you can never be lonesome.
11 It has its moments. It got to be a sort of game to try to outwit father's detectives. II did it once; actually went shopping without a body-guard. It was swell. I felt absolutely immoral. But it didn't last long. They caught up with me in a department store. I was so mad I ran out the back way and jumped into the first car I saw. Guess who was in it?	Santa Claus?
12 KingKing Westley was in it.	Oh. Is that how you met him?
13 Um-hm. We rode around all afternoon. Father was frantic. By 6 o'clock he was having all the rivers dragged. 	Say, where did you learn to dunk, in finishing school?
14 Aw, now, don't you start telling me I shouldn't dunk.	Of course you shouldn't. You don't know how to do it. Dunking's an art. Don't let it soak so long. A dip and plop, into your mouth. If you let it soak so long, it'll get soft and fall off. It's all a matter of timing. I ought to write a book about it.
15 Thanks, professor.	Just goes to show you. Twenty millions and you don't know how to dunk.
16 I'd change places with a plumber's daughter any day.

1 This looks like the best spot.	We're not going to sleep out here, are we?
2 I don't know about you, but I'm going to give a fairly good imitation of it.

1 There it is. Better swallow it. We're not going to have any breakfast.	Needn't rub it in.  What're you eating?
2 Carrots.	Raw?
3 Uh-huh. Want one?	No!!  It's a wonder you couldn't get me something I can eat.
4 You don't think I'm going around panhandling for you.  Best thing in the world for youcarrots. Had a tough time getting them. If that farmer ever caught megoodnight!	I hate the horrid stuff.

1 You don't have to eat the carrots.  Just passed a pond with some ducks in it.	Darling!

1 Maybe I could jump out of the window.  Do you think they'd see me?	Come here, you little fool!

1 Here's your ticket, ma'am.	Oh, thank you. Thank you very much.  Here.
2 Oh, thank you. Thank you.	When does the bus leave?
3 In about fifteen minutes.	Thank you.

1 Heyyou not up yet? Come oncome on!	What time is it?
2 Eight o'clock.

1 Joe, listen	Don't "Joe" me.
2 Okay, Joe. Listenyou know I've always liked you. Anytime I could do you a great turnanytime I ran into a story that looked goodI always came running to you, didn't I? Well, I got one now. Those wires I sent you were on the level. It's the biggest scoop of the year. I'm giving it to you, Joe.	You mean about the Andrews' kid?
3 That's it.  I got it all written up. Ready to go. All I want is a thousand dollars.

1 I told you! I told you, you couldn't trust him! He's gone!	Who?
2 That feller last night, that's who! He was gonna stay a week, huh? Well, he's skipped. Took the car with him, too. We wouldn't have known a thing about it until morning if I hadn't took that magnesia.  Come on, get up, don't lay there. Let's do something about it.

1 Where do you live?	Orange, New Jersey.
2 Got a couple of kids, huh?	Yeah. Just babies.
3 You love them, don't you?	Oh, gee, Misteryou wouldn'tyou ain't thinkin' about
4 You'll keep your trap shut, all right.	SuresureI'll keep my trap shut. you can depend on me, Mister.
5 If you don'tEver hear of Bugs Dooley?	No.
6 Nice guy. Just like you. But he made a big mistake, one day. Got kind of talkative. Know what happened? His kid was found in the bottom of the river. A rock tied around its neck. Poor Bugs! He couldn't take it. Blew his brains out.

1 Yeah, she was pretty, all right, but not half as cute as you, Deano.  You shoulda tried a legitimate line of business.	You can't ever say crime don't pay in Louisiana, Jim - only not as good as it used to.  Good chowder, ain't it?
2 When did you first do business with this Bertrand?	Oh, I first heard these street cats jiving about him back in '56, '57 when I lived down in the Quarter.
3 Street cats?	Swishes.  They swish, y'know.  Young fags, you know.  They'd come into my bureau needing help, no bread, and I'd say, hey man, I ain't Rockefeller, who gonna back you up?  These cornmuffins go to the phone and dial...

1 Or a cover up!  Jesus, Bill, don't you have enough proof of the FBI's complicity now?	Maybe I have a little more respect for this country's institutions than you do, Susie.  You tell me how the hell you can keep a conspiracy going between the Mob, the CIA, FBI, and Army Intelligence and who knows what else, when you know you can't even keep a secret in this room between 12 people!  We got leaks everywhere! We're going to trial here!  What the hell do we really got?  Oswald, Ruby, Banister, Ferrie are dead.  Shaw - maybe he's an agent, I don't know, but as a covert operator in my book he's wide open for blackmail 'cause of his homosexuality.

1 Did he pay you for this?	Twenty dollars each time.  Hell, it's no secret.  That's what I'm here for.

1 I still have to question what the legal basis is that supports this, boss.  Susie's stuff is colorful, but...	Let's start making some assumptions about the man.  Why would he leave a path as big as Lee Harvey Oswald's? This is not a thin trail, gentlemen, it is a very wide one.  Who found the evidence?  Who set him up?  Lou, Bill, Susie, I want you to go back and check all the sightings of Oswald in Dallas, New Orleans and Mexico in the summer and fall of '63 - see if it's the same guy.

1 What's it look like, Nick?	I don't see any violence, Jim.  Heart attack, maybe an aneurysm.  Looks like natural causes.

1 Do you mind if I smoke, Mr. Garrison?	How could I?  Dave, as you know, President Kennedy was assassinated on Friday.  A man named Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested as a suspect and then was murdered yesterday by a man named Jack Ruby.  We've heard reports that Oswald spent the summer in New Orleans and we've been advised you knew Oswald pretty well.
2 That's not true.  I never met anybody named Oswald.  Anybody who told you that has to be crazy.	But you are aware, he served in your Civil Air Patrol unit when he was a teenager.
3 No... if he did, I don't remember him.  There were lots of kids in and out... y'know.	I'm sure you've seen this.  Perhaps you knew this man under another name?
4 No, I never saw him before in my life.	Well that must've been mistaken information we got.  Thanks for straightening it out for us.  There is one other matter that's come up, Dave.  We were told you took a trip to Texas shortly after the assassination of Friday.
5 Yeah, now that's true.  I drove to Houston.	What was so appealing about Houston?
6 I hadn't been there ice skating in many years, and I had a couple of young friends with me, and we decided we wanted to go ice skating.	Dave, may I ask why the urge to go ice skating in Texas happened to strike you during one of the most violent thunderstorms in recent memory?
7 Oh, it was just a spur of the moment thing...  the storm wasn't that bad.	I see.  And where did you drive?
8 We went straight to Houston, and then Saturday night we drove to Galveston and stayed over there.	Why Galveston?
9 No particular reason.  Just to go somewhere.	And then Sunday?
10 In the morning we went goose hunting. Then headed home, but I dropped the boys off to see some relatives and I stayed in Hammond.	Did you bag any geese on this trip?
11 I believe the boys got a couple.	But the boys told us they didn't get any.
12 Oh yes, well, come to think of it, they're right.  We got to where the geese were and there were thousands of them.  But you couldn't approach them.  They were a wise bunch of birds.	Your young friends also told us you had no weapons in the car.  Dave, isn't it a bit difficult to hunt for geese without a shotgun?
13 Yes, now I remember, Mr. Garrison. I'm sorry, I got confused.  We got out there near the geese and it was only then we realized we'd forgotten our shotguns.  Stupid, right?  So of course we didn't get any geese.	I see.  Dave thank you for your time.  I'm sorry it has to end inconveniently for you, but I'm going to have you detained for further questioning by the FBI.
14 Why?  What's wrong?	Dave, I find your story simply not believable.

1 I don't remember his name.  You must understand it was quite crowded, and when you are called in circumstances like that to look at the wound of the President who is dead, you don't look around too much to ask people for their names and who they are.	But you were a qualified pathologist. Was this Army general a qualified pathologist?
2 No.	But you took his orders.  He was directing the autopsy.
3 No, because there were others.  There were admirals.	There were admirals.
4 Oh yes, there were admirals - and when you are a lieutenant colonel in the Army you just follow orders, and at the end of the autopsy we were specifically told - as I recall it was Admiral Kenney, the Surgeon General of the Navy - we were specifically told not to discuss the case.

1 If we go to him our investigation'll hit the front pages by sunrise. Blow up right in our face.  Ruby was just given a new trial.  If he has something to say, it'll be there. Susie, what did you find out on Oswald?	Negative on his tax records. Classified.  First time I know a D.A. can't get a tax record.  I put together a list of all the CIA files on Oswald that were part of the Warren Report and asked for them.  There are about 1200 documents...  Oswald in the USSR, in Mexico City, Oswald and the U2, a CIA 201 personnel file, a memo from the Director on Oswald, travel and activities - can't get one of them.  All classified as secret on the grounds of national security.  It's real strange.

1 Aren't you being a little hard?	No, I don't think I am, Susie.  Anyone else?

1 In the sheriff's report, Mrs. Mercer, it says you were at Dealey Plaza two hours before the assassination but that...	Yes, it was about 11 in the morning. I was driving west on Elm Street toward the Triple Underpass, in a rented car - a blue Valiant.  I'll never forget that day.

1 Hi.	Tough day.
2 My sympathies.	Liz, I'm really sorry.  The meeting went much longer than expected.
3 We waited for you... hours, Jim. You could have telephoned, for God's sake.  It's Easter!  You promised, Jim.	I don't know what to say except I'm sorry.  I just don't have rabbits on my mind.
4 I think you care more about John Kennedy than your family!  All day long the kids are asking, "Where's Daddy?"  What am I supposed to tell your kids, Jim!	I don't know what to tell them.  How 'bout the truth - I'm doing my job to make sure they can grow up in a country where justice won't be an arcane, vanished idea they read about in history books, like the dinosaurs or the lost continent of Atlantis.
5 That sounds dandy, but it doesn't replace a father and a husband on Easter Day.	It's going to get worse, honey.

1 I want to thank you, Mr. O'Keefe, for this time.	Call me Willie.  I ain't got nuthin' but time, Mr. Garrison.  Minutes, hours, days, years of'em.  Time just stands still here like a snake sunnin' itself in the road...

1 Post Office.	Upstairs.  In 1963 that was the Office of Naval Intelligence - And just by coincidence, Banister, before he was FBI, was ONI.  What do they say?
2 "Once ONI, always ONI"?

1 I took it once for a low thyroid condition...  It raises the metabolism, Lou.  Did David Ferrie strike you as the kind of person who had a low metabolism?	I'd say the opposite - hypertension.

1 Hell, you're the District Attorney. You read the Warren Report - and then you tell me you're satisfied Lee Oswald shot the President all by his lonesome.	Russell, honestly you sound like one of those kooky critics spreading paranoia like prairie fire.  I just can't believe the Chief Justice of the United States would put his name on something that wasn't true.
2 Honey, another one of these.  This one's as weak as cricket pee-pee. Yessir, you mark my words, Jim, Vietnam's gonna cost Johnson '68 and it's gonna put that other varmint Nixon in - then watch your hide, 'cause there ain't no offramps on a freeway to Hell!

1 Here's my problem, Jack.  You told me you and Guy were good friends for a long time?	More than ten years.
2 And he never hit you before?	Never touched me.
3 Yet on November 22, 1963 - the day of the President's murder - our police report says he pistol-whipped you with a .357 Magnum.  But the police report says you had an argument over the phone bill. Here, take a look at it.  Now, does a simple argument over phone bills sound like a believable explanation to you?

1 HOLD IT, CHIEF...	You just need some sleep, Lou.  It won't look so bad when...

1 I know about that shot.  A terrible tragedy.  How much do you have for carrying on your investigation?	If you must know, virtually nothing.
2 How many men are working with you on this?	Less than you would guess.  Most days two to three assistant D.A.'s. A handful of police investigators.
3 That's all you've had all this time?	That's it.

1 I'm sorry, I just decided to stay in the suit -- get out of that damn uniform.	Oh, that's not a problem.

1 Answer the question, nigga. Do you think I wanted to spend the thousand dollars on your ass? Yes or no?	Course you didn't.
2 But the only way to help you was to do that, so I did it.  Okay, how 'bout this? After we're through fuckin' with these Koreans, I take you to Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles. My treat.

1 Hi, I'm Detective Mark Dargus. L.A.P.D. can I ask what you have in that bag?	The usual things. I'm a flight attendant with Cabo Air.

1 Oh, I wouldn't be so sure. What with all the cash, I think I could go with Conspiracy to Traffic.	I'm tellin' you, I don't know nothin' about that fuckin' shit.

1 Who put up my bond? Ordell?	In cash.

1 What'dya think?	I think maybe I have more options than I thought.

1 I called in sick this morning. As far as the airline knows, I'm still available.	Are you?
2 I don't know yet. I'm going to talk with Dargus and Nicolet today. Do what you suggested. Offer to help and see what happens.	What I meant was have a lawyer do the negotiating for you.
3 I want to talk to them first. I know more now about Ordell's money.	Well, if the A.T.F. guy is the one who wants you, that'll only interest him up to a point.
4 It's a lot of money. About a half-a- million dollars. All of it in Cabo in safe deposit boxes and more comin' in.	How'd you find that out?
5 He told me last night.	He called you?
6 He came by.	What?... What'd you do?
7 We talked.

1 What're you, a bag lady?	I go back to work tomorrow.
2 You talk them into it?	They seem to like the idea.
3 Bring the money in and they follow it?	Yea, but I'm going to dress it up. Put the money in a shopping bag and hand it to someone I meet here.
4 You don't actually do it that way?	He always just picked it up at my place. But with A.T.F. involved, I want to stage it. You know, make it look more intriguing, like we know what the fuck we're doin'. Then it's up to Ray Nicolet, the A.T.F. guy to follow the shopping bag.
5 Make the delivery somewhere in the mall.	Right around here, in the food court.
6 Sit down, leave the bag under the table?

1 I told them Ordell's changed the amount he's bringing in.	Do you think they bought it?
2 Oh, yeah. I got them thinking Ordell's real nervous. They love thinking he's scared of them.	You know, a good cop won't let you know he knows you're fulla shit.
3 All he needed was a reasonable explanation.

1 That's Ordell's.	They've confiscated all his other stuff. But this one's sorta left over. The registration's in the glove box, the keys were under the seat... What's a matter, haven't you ever borrowed someone's car?
2 Not after they're dead.

1 Oh, Miss Brown?	Yeah?

1 Ordell has a white guy working for him named Louis.	You two meet?
2 This afternoon before I came here. He was with Ordell at an apartment in Hermosa Beach. I don't know if he lives there, but I can find out.	You talk to him?
3 Not really.	His full name is Louis Gara. He just got out from serving four years in Susanville.
4 What for?	Bank robbery? Do you know what he does for Ordell?
5 I imagine shit needs to be done.	We've been following Mr. Gara, and he's definitely working for Ordell.

1 Sure.	Great...  ...Wanda!

1 I got some vodka in the freezer.	Got some o.j.?
2 Yeah.

1 Now, baby, that's got nothin' to do with you. I just carry that. You been listenin' to them cops too much.	The cops didn't try and strangle my ass.
2 Damn, Jackie, I was just playin' with you.	Well, I ain't playin with you. I'm gonna unload both these motherfuckers, you don't do what I tell you. Understand what I'm saying?
3 Baby, I ain't come here -- She shoves both guns in Ordell's back.	I said, you understand what I'm saying
4 I understand woman, damn!	Go sit over in that chair.

1 You told em? You told em it's me?	They already know it's you.
2 Well, shit. That don't mean you gotta confirm it!	Look, the only way I can get permission to fly is if I agree to help them. Which is what I have to appear to be doing. So I give them something they already know. You.
3 Didja tell 'em anything else?	I told them you got a half a million dollars in Mexico, and you want me to bring it here.

1 And a hundred thousand if I go to jail.	We're partners, Baby, sorta. I ain't gonna screw you. You haven't told me where I put it for you.

1 You're fourteen years old here?	Yeah.
2 I thought you were sixteen.	I was pretty much the same height now as I was then.
3 Were you a disco girl?	Noooo, I was a surfer girl. Besides, I was only fourteen. I couldn't go to discos.
4 So where did you go?	The beach. Or get high, drop acid at a friend's place. I was a K.L.O.S. girl. I hated disco.

1 We're leaving now!	All right already.

1 See, what did I tell you? Man in New York wants a 9 millimeter Smith and Wesson Model 5946. Why does he want it? It's the gun that nigga on "New York Undercover" uses. Because of that nigga, I can sell it to this nigga for twelve-fifty.	What's your cost?
2 As low as two.	Are you serious?
3 That's what I been tellin' you. Start adding these motherfuckin' figures up, and you tell me this ain't a business to be in.

1 If this is about you fucked Melanie, I don't give a damn. I ain't a fool. I leave you alone with a bitch like Melanie, you're gonna be fuckin' that twenty minutes after I'm out the door. So say "thank you" and I'll tell you, "you're welcome."	That's not what I meant when I asked did you trust her.

1 Okay, so it was Jackie Brown.	If she's got it, why didn't she take it all?
2 'fore I blow that bitch's brains out, I'll ask her.	Maybe the Feds got it.
3 If there were nothin; in here but towels, maybe she didn't get a chance to take it from her suitcase and A.T.F. got it. But, she put these fuckin' books in here to trick our ass.	That's why I never checked it. The bag felt right.
4 Then she throws forty thousand in here, to rub the shit in my face, know what I'm saying? She wants me to know she ripped me off.	I don't know. Either she has it or the Feds.
5 Or...  ...she gave it to somebody else first, before Melanie went in the dressing room.

1 Who's it for? A relative?	Fella named Beaumont. They have him up at county. It started out drunk driving, but they wrote it up "possession of a concealed weapon." Dumb monkey-ass had a pistol on him.
2 Ten thousand sounds high.	They ran his name and got a hit. He's been in before.

1 What's up with this shit.	I think falling in live with movie stars is something that happens to a man as he gets older.

1 My money's in that office, right?	Uh-huh.
2 She starts givin' me some bullshit about it ain't there. It's somewhere else and we can go get it.  I'm shootin' you in the head right then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot her in the kneecap, find out where my godamn money is. I go walkin' in there and that nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you're the first man shot, understand what I'm sayin'?	Yeah.
3 Now, is there anything you want to tell me before we get out of this car?	No.
4 You sure?	Yes.
5 You better be, motherfucker.

1 Get me out of here.	Where do you want to go?
2 Take me home.	Home?  This is your home. You're dead.
3 Dead? No. I just hurt my back. I'm not dead.	What are you then?
4 I'm alive.	Then what are you doing here?
5 I don't know. I don't know.  This isn't happening.	What isn't happening?
6 Let me out of here!	There is no out of here. You've been killed. Don't you remember?

1 Daddy!	Oh God!
2 You're hurting me!	Stop!!!!
3 Daddy. Let go.	What do you want from me?
4 LET GO!

1 Who's been talking to you? The army? Have they been talking to you, huh?	Nobody's been talking to nobody. You don't have a case, you hear me? It's pure and simple. Now leave me alone. Okay?

1 Dr. Carlson's dead?	An explosion, just like Paul's.

1 Are you in the service?	The postal service. I'm a mailman.
2 Ah. Neither snow nor sleet, nor dark of night ... I always admired that.	It's good to see you.
3 Likewise.

1 What a dream I was having. I was living with another woman ... You know who it was?	I don't want to know.
2 Jezebel, from the post office. You remember, you met her that time at the Christmas party. I was living with her. God, it was a nightmare. There were all these demons and I was on fire. Only I was burning from ice.	Guilty thoughts. See what happens when you cheat on me, even in your mind?
3 She was good in bed, though.	Go to sleep.
4 She had these real beefy thighs. Delicious.	I thought you said it was a nightmare?

1 You up?	No. Have you seen my glasses?
2 Where'd you leave 'em?	I don't know.
3 Did you look around the headboard?	Jezzie, I can't see.
4 Maybe you left 'em in the bathroom.

1 It's still there, Jake.  Even if you never say a word about it. You can't spend two years in Vietnam ...	What does that have to do with anything? Does it explain the barricaded subway stations? Does it explain those Godforsaken creatures?
2 New York is filled with creatures. Everywhere. And lots of stations are closed.	They're like demons, Jez.
3 Demons, Jake? Come on. They're winos and bag ladies. Low life. That's all they are. The streets are crawling with 'em. Don't make em into somethin' they're not.  It's the pressure, honey. That's all it is.	Those guys tried to kill me tonight. They were aiming right at me.
4 Kids on a joy ride. Happens all the time.	They weren't human!
5 Come on. What were they, Jake?

1 Don't gimme that.	Lie down!
2 Jezzie! My feet are throbbing!	Sam, Tony, come in here.
3 Hey, I'm not dressed.

1 Don't!	It might be for me.
2 I'm not here. You haven't seen me.	Hello ... No. He's not here. I haven't seen him all night ... I don't know when ... What? Tell him what?  Vietnam? ... What experiments?

1 So tell me ... am I still an angel?	With wings.  You transport me, you know that? You carry me away.

1 Anyway, this big offensive was coming up. Everyone knew it; Time Magazine, Huntley-Brinkley. And the brass was scared 'cause they knew we couldn't win. Morale was down. It was gettin' ugly in the States. Hell, you remember.	Like it was yesterday.
2 A couple days later they decided to use the Ladder, on one test battalion. Yours. Just in an infintessimal dose in the food supply, to prove its effectiveness in the field. They were sure your unit would have the highest kill ratio in the whole goddamn offensive. And you did, too. But not the way they tnought.

1 Excuse me, do you know if we've passed Nostrand Avenue yet?  Excuse me.  Look, I'm asking a simple question. Have we hit Nostrand Avenue? I fell asleep.	I no from around here.
2 Yeah, you and everyone else.

1 I'll page him.	Call my chiropractor.
2 We're doing everything we can.	Louis Schwartz. Nostrand Avenue.

1 I'm afraid to go by myself anymore. I keep thinkin' one of 'em's gonna come up behind me. Somethin's wrong when a guy can't even take a leak by himself. I've seen 'em take people right off the street. I used to go home a different way every night. Now I can't even go home.	You come home with me.
2 What about your girlfriend? You don't think she'll mind?	Are you kidding? We've put up more of her cousins. You wouldn't believe how they breed down there.

1 Okay, enough of this shit.	Alright, asshole.

1 We can't lead him into the other hull!	We don't have a choice!

1 Can't shut em' down from here.	Somebody's gonna have to go back to the engine room.

1 Everyone okay?	I think I broke my arm.

1 Brodski! Get to Lab two. We have an emergency!	Er, guys. Where's the Hockey Player?

1 Boeman, the ships not here.	Use the thrusters and you'll be fine. We'll huddle together out there.
2 Hey, easy now.

1 Yeah, I got ya. I don't see anything inside though.	You just keep an eye out.
2 Yeah yeah. Got it.

1 You sumbitch! Three dead! On my watch! If that...that thing is out there, it's dead! You got it!!!	Fuckin A...
2 Now get out of our way...get back to the lab and baby sit your snot nosed brats... we've got a job to do!

1 Don't just stand there! Shoot him!	No you don't!

1 Jason seemed to have the right stuff. Physically, anyway. Radiation, cell damage, didn't matter. He just kept going.	Were you close to your father?

1 Delongpre, you don't even know me.	I know you.

1 We must assume the machete was an intricate part of the game of hockey.	I'm thinking Rizzo was right.
2 Thinking with your dick again, Delongpre?	Maybe we should go with them. Like you said, your Space Lab connections can deal with this thing. At least we'll be safe.
3 They are not going anywhere. I cut power to the  shuttle.

1 He's trying to ask you out on a date.	Shut up, Thorgan!

1 Hey teach! This rock's starting to freeze! Get your ass back hre!	Keep your shirt on! I'm working on it. You won't believe what we found.  Adrienne! Stoney!

1 You're quicker than usual.	Later.
2 You prefer an apple?

1 Robot huh?	Kay-em 14.
2 Barbie from hell...	Cybernetics science droid, fluent in over six...
3 Yeah 3cpo, I saw STAR WARS, now how about you help me get out of this coffin, Barbie...	I'm afraid I cannot assist.

1 Sorry, sorry.	Who are you apologizing to?
2 Good point.

1 I don't understand...what does he want?	He wants to kill you...and me...and everyone on this ship.

1 How did I get here, how did you bring me back?	Nanotechnology.
2 Nano...but nanotechnology is impossible.	We've had Nano-Tech for the last 30 years.
3 30? How long was I out?

1 How do you open the damn door?	You're crazy!

1 Son! -- Out of the water now!	My boat's neat, dad!
2 I want him out of the ocean.

1 What's the point with hooks and Lines? --	Don't tell me my business!  Quarter-mile, that way. Full throttle.

1 What about us?	Have to pump her steady, s'all.

1 Sexy, hm? What was I before?	Older, sillier.
2 I don't want to depend on these things, y'know - sometimes you can weaken your eyes.

1 Home... New York?	No. Home here.

1 Who's that young man?	Matt Hooper, the specialist they send down from the Oceanographic Institute.
2 I think we all owe a debt of gratitude to these men for catching this monster.

1 I didn't say this wasn't the shark, I just said I wasn't sure this was the one...	What d'ya mean?
2 There are hundreds of different kinds of sharks; makos, blues, hammerheads, white-tips... any one of them could've attacked. Look -- shark digestion is slow. We could open this one up, and find whatever he's been eating is still inside.

1 Don't they have lifejackets or something? An extra boat?	They must've hit something.

1 Don't shoot him any more! He's crazy on his own blood already!	I can't stand here doing nothing!

1 Look, I've got to talk to her. This isn't a contest we want the whole country entering.	I agree. If she's going to advertise, I wouldn't recommend out-of-town papers. Amity people could take care of this.
2 I'm responsible for public safety around here...

1 Here's to your husband, the only other rational man on the island. Day after tomorrow, I'll be gone, and he'll be the only one.	You're leaving?
2 Going out on the 'Aurora.'	Is that a boat?
3 Is it! The best-funded research expedition to ever study the shark... around the world in 18 months.	Like those Cousteau specials on television? I think it's for the kids, but I love them.
4 Better than Cousteau, or Compagno with computers, telemetry, Defense Department funding...	I saw a show with sea otters, and a big turtle... Mikey loved it. Made me promise to get him one. Will you live on the boat?
5 Yep.	Martin hates boats. Hates the water. On the ferry to the mainland, he sits in the car the whole way over. He's got this childhood thing, there's a clinical word for it.

1 Nothing. Nothing, nothing, nothing.	Hell, in the old days we went out with good charts, good sounding lead, and a damn good compass. Nowadays, these kids are afraid to go out without depth finders, radar, radio, electric toothbrush, every stupid thing...

1 Face and head scars come from amateur amusements in the bar room. This love line here...  ...that's from some crazy Frenchie come after me with a knife. I caught him with a good right hand right in the snot locker and laid him amongst the sweetpeas.	Ever see one like this?

1 That's disgusting! This is the largest, meanest, most vicious shark ever landed off Amity Island, and a known maneater!	Let's just cut him open and see what's inside...

1 Well! Nothing like experimenting.	I did the prep questions for this lab last night. You can copy my answers if you need to.

1 Are you honestly and truly going to prom with Katrina De Voort?	Um, hi?
2 Leah just told me you were going with her.	Yeah, I did ask her if she wanted to go. A bunch of us from the team are going to Benihana, then the prom, then Vijay's parents' cabin.

1 Wait, what's that supposed to mean?	I just see a lot of teenage mothers come through here. It's obviously a poisonous environment for a baby to be raised in.

1 That was a mistake, Juno. Mark is a married stranger. You overstepped a boundary.	Listen, Bren-duhhh, I think you're the one overstepping boundaries. You're acting like you're the one who has to go through this and get huge and push a baby out of your vag for someone else. Besides, who cares if he's married? I can have friends who are married.
2 It doesn't work that way, kiddo. You don't know squat about the dynamics of marriage.	You don't know anything about me!
3 I know enough.

1 So, let's discuss how we're gonna do this... thing.	Well, I just have the baby and give it to you, right?

1 Why aren't you at work?	I mostly work from home. I'm a composer.
2 No shit. Like Johannes Brahms?	No, more commercial stuff.
3 Like what?	Commercials.
4 Oh.	Have you seen those ads for Titanium Power men's deodorant?
5 Titanium Power! Get more snatch by the batch!	I wrote that.
6 You're kind of a sellout, aren't you? What would the Melvins say?	They'd say you came a long way out here not knowing if anyone would be home.

1 Vanessa. Shit, you better get out of here.	Why? What the big deal?
2 Nothing. She just hates when I sit around watching movies and 'not contributing.'	I'll handle this. I'm really good at diffusing mom-type rage.

1 "Most Fruitful Yuki"? What is... Oh my god, she's a pregnant superhero!	Isn't that great? I got it when I was in Japan with my band. She reminds me of you.

1 Hi! I'm Vanessa. You must be Juno and Mr. MacGuff. I'm Vanessa.	Vanessa, right?

1 What...	This is the baby. Your baby.

1 Mark? Why is Juno crying?	I'm not crying. I'm allergic to fine home furnishings. See you later.

1 Did you say you were thinking about adoption?	Yeah, well, there's this couple who've been trying to have a baby for five years.

1 Well, you know where the lavatory is.  You pay for that pee stick when you're done! Don't think it's yours just because you've marked it with your urine!	Jesus, I didn't say it was.
2 Well, it's not. You're not a lion in a pride!  These kids, acting like lions with their unplanned pregnancies and their Sunny Delights.

1 Look at this one "Wholesome, spiritually wealthy couple have found true love with each other."  "All that's missing is your bastard."	There's a guy in here who's giving away a piano. Free for the hauling! We should put it in Bleeker's yard.
2 You're not listening to me.	No, I heard you. I just can't give the baby to people who describe themselves as "wholesome." I'm looking for something a little edgier.
3 What did you have in mind, a family of disturbed loners who are into gunplay and incest?	I was thinking a graphic designer, mid-thirties, and his cool Asian wife who dresses awesome and plays bass. But I'm trying to not be too particular.
4 All right, how about this one? "Healthy, educated couple seeking infant to join our family of five. You will be compensated. Help us complete the circle of love."	Yeesh, they sound like a cult. Besides, they're greedy bitches. They already have three kids!
5 Hey, Juno. Juno! Look at this one.

1 I want a huge cookie. And like, a lamb kebob. Simultaneously.	God, Spermy. Must you always feed?

1 You guys are playing music?	Juno just wanted a closer look at Kimber here.

1 No.	Me neither. How 'bout you Carrie?

1 You dropped this.	Early Grayce if this ain't your lucky day.

1 You shouldn't let him do that to you...	Do what?
2 Adele... are you serious?	You think Early's bad to me, don't you?
3 Yeah.

1 What if they're dangerous?	They ain't dangerous Adele. They're writers.

1 Nobody wants to hurt you Peaches!	Early! Stop!!

1 Can't hurt.	How much do I owe you?
2 Forget it.

1 Hey... Ain't we getting near the next murder site... Bri?	Forget about it, doesn't matter.
2 Hell it don't...  ...Hand me Brian's map there Adele. One day I'm gonna pass some store and see your book in the window. Me and Adele gonna buy a copy for our coffee table.

1 Hey. I didn't have the heart to wake you.	Thanks. What are you doing?
2 Well, I sat down with my tapes and your photographs, which are great by the way... and I started writing.

1 Feel sorry for him? Obviously you didn't get a whiff of that sock?	Bitch, bitch, bitch!
2 Up yours.	I heard that.

1 Brian I want him out of our car!	Why, what did he do?
2 Brian get him out of the car. Next gas station either he leaves or I do!

1 Ain't you done enough drinking for tonight?	...Brian hurt his foot.

1 You're supposed to call me when you lose your job Early. I stopped by the mirror factory today, you left quite a mess behind there.	Wasn't my fault...

1 Shit.	Was up bitch?

1 You wanna go to Paul's house?	What for? That guys a dick.
2 I'm sure he's got food. He's always got those microwave burrito things in his freezer.	You think he's got any herb?
3 I don't know, he quit dealin' but I'll bet he'll smoke us out.	You think?
4 Probably.	He lives on 76th?
5 78th.	Den less go Joe.

1 I'm not joking. I wanted to take my dick out and start jacking right there. At that point and moment, Darcy was like a vision of perfection.	I know what you mean.
2 At that moment, at that block party, she represented everything holy about a virgin.	She hangs out at Nasa. She promotes for them.
3 I'm gonna fuck her tonight. I swear to God I'm gonna fuck her.	How are you gonna fuck two virgins in a day? That shits gotta be against the law.
4 I don't care motha fucka. I'll bet you money she fucks me.	Bet.

1 Yo. I'm gonna get buff dude.	You are?
2 Yeah. The other day, some sort of Chinese bitch told me I'd look good with muscles.

1 Sup then? Sup?	Come on bitch. Throw your fists up.

1 Do you like kissing me?	Yes.

1 You know what I want to do?	Yeah.
2 What do I want to do?	You want to fuck me. But you can't fuck me.
3 Why?	Because, you know why. You know.
4 Because your a virgin?	Because I'm a virgin and I don't want no baby.
5 You think I want a baby? When you're with me, you don't have to worry about that kinda stuff.	Why is that?
6 Because I like you. I think you're beautiful. I think if we fucked you would love it. You wouldn't even believe it.	I wouldn't believe it?
7 I don't know. I just think that you would love it.	But, I don't know. I'm just scared that things would change. Between us.
8 What things? I'm telling you, nothing's going to change.  I want to make you happy. That's all.

1 Sorry.	Oh it's OK. That's life. Maybe tomorrow I'll win lotto. Who knows? You don't. No one does.

1 Yep, yep. But he has to know what he's doing and where he's going. Because they can like touch you for hours and they won't ever know.	Hell yeah, they don't know.

1 I'll ask you one last time. Do you have diss digg?	Whah you say? Dissdee?

1 I've known the past of all the people I've fucked without a condom. Like I know one of the people got tested and was negative.	Yeah.
2 And I know that one of them fucked like two other girls, who were both virgins, so I knew he was safe.	Yeah.
3 And the other person I just fucked, which was a mistake. But I went to the clinic last week with Jennie.

1 What are you guys doing?	Nothing. We just wanted to come by and see what you were up to.
2 You want a wip-it?	Nah.

1 I've talked to a few people who say you and her were... friendly?	Chess tournaments can be boring sometimes.  People have a lot of free time.  They like to gossip.

1 We didn't ask for your opinion, Doctor.	Maybe you should.

1 You set yourself up tonight when you attacked Kathy, you crazy fuck!	What?

1 The F.B.I. has nothing remotely similar to this guy.  I think he's a first- timer.	Check with the State.  If he's never killed outside of Washington the F.B.I. wouldn't have it.  Nolan?

1 A few people.	Did anyone stand out?
2 What do you mean, stand out?	Did anyone look suspicious?  Think!
3 Now that you mention it there was somebody who looked suspicious.	What was suspicious about him?

1 I suppose you want to know where I'm going to kill tonight, Peter?	You're not going to tell me that.
2 "Wee Willie Winkie runs through the town.  Upstairs and downstairs in his nightgown.  Crawling through the window.  At the end of Miss Emma's street.  Her God has gone and left his home.  So her and I can meet."

1 Interesting concept.  I hadn't thought of that.  If you think about how Anton Berger plays chess you might get it.	I'm beginning to think it doesn't mean anything.  Remember eventually revenge- -
2 --you're hopeless!  You can't even read a sentence!  Didn't they teach you punctuation in school?  The game ends tonight!

1 What's this?	Oh, I put a few games on for your daughter.  I hope you don't mind.
2 Of course not.

1 It worked out alright, didn't it?	Fuck off!

1 Congratulations, dad.	My cheering section.

1 He tapes their mouths shut.  We found traces of adhesive around the victims mouths.  We're doing a chemical analysis for components, but it's probably a standard brand you can buy in any hardware store.	There's only two hardware stores on the whole Island.  We'll check that out. What about the blood?
2 Not a drop.  Maybe the guy works for the Red Cross.

1 I don't think it matters.  Last nights victim, Christie Eastman was found in a warehouse on the outskirts of town. The night before, Debi Rutlege was found in the center.	Meaning?

1 We can't rely on your judgement anymore.	What does that mean?

1 You want me to go with you?  Maybe I can help.	That's alright.  We'll take it from here.

1 A shadow.  What's as big a castle?  As light as air , but one hundred men can't move it?  The shadow of the castle.  Are there any buildings that have the name Castle in it that cast a shadow long enough to fall across another building?	Wait a minute.  There's an apartment in that area called the Castle Arms.
2 That's got to be it.

1 You have something you want to say?	Just thought you might want to talk.
2 About what?	Whatever's on your mind.
3 Who says something's on my mind.

1 Well, I think I've had enough.	Getting too hot in here for you?

1 Relax.	How the hell can I relax after seeing what I just saw.
2 I know it was bad.	How could you?  Unless you were there.

1 Fine.	What do you want on it?
2 You.	Would you settle for pepperoni?
3 If I have to.  I'm going to take a shower.

1 This letter.  I've never opened it.	Why not?
2 Because I know what it says.	Maybe you're afraid of what it says.

1 Take off your clothes. I'm going to scrub you down.	<u>What</u>?
2 We're almost married.	We're not married <u>yet</u>.
3 Well, then you can go up to the parapet and I'll hand the buckets up to you.

1 Take the western passage.	All directions are the same here.

1 With two or three days' practice, you'll be able to use it as well as I can. Then we'll have a chance of fighting our way out of here.	Two or three days! While Lyssa is in their hands?
2 There is no other way.	But there is another entrance to this place.

1 No. We will find another way to locate the Fortress.	There is no other way. You asked me why the Beast had come this time.
2 Yes.	He has come for Lyssa.
3 Lyssa? <u>Why</u>?	Like you, she has extraordinary powers. He would make her his Queen.
4 Can she be forced?	No. She must agree of her own free will.
5 Never.	You are young. You don't understand the attraction of great power, and you forget the pain of long waiting.
6 Then we must reach her before she feels that pain.	Yes.

1 How did you know?	I found the body of the Seer in the stream.

1 Help! Help! I'm drowning!	I doubt it. The water is only an inch deep.
2 It could have been quicksand! I might have been sucked to my death.  Where is this place?	A forest near the Valley of Needles.
3 Blast! A thousand miles off course. Well, I was rushed. There was a certain difference of opinion concerning a venison pie. The foolish man left it sitting on his windowsill. What did he expect?	Perhaps he expected to eat it.
4 For that rudeness, peasant lout, I am going to leave you hanging by your heels when I depart. Which is right now.

1 They burn many villages. Even walled cities fall to them.	Why do they burn the villages? There's nothing to gain.

1 A good thrust, my friend. Another second and there'd have been nothing between my head and shoulders but bad memories.	I intend to keep you alive, your majesty. So you can abdicate your throne and become my Warlord.
2 Perhaps. If the pay is good.

1 I am Ergo the Magnificent ...  ... short in stature ...  ... tall in power ...  ... narrow of purpose ...  ... wide of vision.	I ...  ... am Titch.

1 Oh, my poor stew!	Oh, my poor stomach.

1 It's a lie!	These walls do not lie! He will betray you.
2 He will not!	Then he will die!

1 We seek the Fortress of Krull.	Such a vision will be opposed. Who seeks it?
2 The new King.	With an old voice?
3 You know the voice.	Yes. You have left your place in the Needle. It is the time, then.
4 It is the time.	I will seek the Fortress for you.

1 We must reach the Valley of Reeds before the next dawn.	It's a hundred leagues from here.

1 It will not help.	Then the other Lyssa will share your fate. She will grow old in the Fortress as you have grown old here.

1 No, no.	Pay attention to women, Leon.  They are dangerous, you know?
2 Yeah... Well... I don't know.. I don't know any.	Listen, think about what you want to do, but don't worry, your money is there and it's safer than in a bank... Banks are robbed every five minutes!

1 The yellow and pink.	OK.

1 ...You can leave whenever you want. I don't refrain you.	...This is what I don't like, you see: you don't refrain me, but at the same time I can't get out!

1 It's cool departing this way... warm... music...	There are better things.  You see the importance of the "moment".  Ten minutes early or late, he'd have seen death. He'd have suffered it.  This way, he already departed. Without knowing.
2 ...I'd like knowing what he's listening to...	...Later.

1 ...Don't you drink?	I prefer waiting for a while...  I feel it would go the wrong way.

1 You say it just to calm me!	Not at all, Mathilda! I tell you because it's true! You'll buy the globe you told me about and you will choose, OK? We'll go where you want! I swear, you'll see, Mathilda!!

1 ...Who sent you?	Giancarlo... Rinaldi.

1 This smells good.	Why am I such an authority?
2 Here comes the resume.	I received my B.S. from the University of Pennsylvania, my P.H.D. from Bryn Mawr College.  I worked three years at the Boston University School of Medicine, during which time I had articles printed in the "Journal of Educational Psychology", "American Journal of Psychology", "Psychology Review" and "Science"... So I think it's safe to say my opinion is valid.

1 I have to finish first.	I won't let you die.

1 So what's the deal Maurice?	Pardon?
2 I mean why the sudden voluntary visit  -- usually it takes gun- point to get you in here...	Routine, I assure you.  I just wanted to gage my health.  Am I healthy?
3 Yes -- you are.	I'm going to ask you a question that may sound peculiar.

1 I want to be shown...  Maurice would you do anything for me?	Yes.
2 Anything?	What do you want from me?  Would I swim across an ocean for you?... Would I walk across the United States for you?  Yes... Yes I would.  You know that.
3 No I don't.  I don't even know if you'd walk across the street for me.

1 It isn't going to make it Ellen. Let the poor thing go quietly.	It'll make it.

1 You don't have to prove anything to her.	I'm not proving to her.  I'm showing her.  And I know I don't have to.  I want to.  I've realized, love is about giving. I'm alive, I can still give to her. I want to give her everything I can.

1 Your parents would want you to be in bed.	You tell stories?
2 Oh no... I'm not good at that. Very bad in fact...

1 Lizy, Eliza... Elizabeth Bennett...  Pride and Prejudice.	You're amazing.
2 It has to be a full character's name.	They called her 'Lizy' in the book...  Sorry I was late.  My jeep died on the way over from the paper.
3 They printed your article on, 'Dry Verses Can Dog Food'... Very enlightening.	Pulitzer, here I come.

1 Ellen told me that she didn't know if I loved her.	She knew you loved her.
2 She wasn't certain... I never really showed her.

1 We do the operation after I finish. I can't risk not finishing... I thought you understood what I was doing.	I do.
2 Why in God's name did you fly all the way here then?	Don't do this.
3 ... To look me in the eye and say what's important to you isn't as important to me?  To tell me you know what's best?  To tell me life is more precious than what I feel for my wife?

1 I don't have kids.	You should.  Children are a blessing from God.  I have four.

1 Hello!	Hello.
2 Are you working?	Working? What do you mean, working? I'm walking.

1 What's the story? Are you too drunk to come?	I don't care about that. There's time left. You can have more money. You can drink all you want. You can talk or listen. Just stay, that's all I want.

1 You OK?	Of course. Wow... you look extremely beautiful.
2 Thank you. What time is it?	Don't know. My watch went the way of the car.

1 Hi!	Why don't you go in and sit down. I have some gifts for you.
2 Right... OK...

1 I like women who wear mismatched earrings.	Well, then... I hope we don't run into any tonight.
2 What do you mean?	I expect some kind of loyalty here. Just because I fuck for money doesn't give you cause to start picking up women and leaving me looking silly.

1 Years ago, in LA, I turned a trick on Sunset and Western. The guy was polite and didn't argue about the price. He parked his car and I took him to a house that I had an arrangement with. A fat Mexican woman was watching a TV and I told him to give her the twenty for the room. There were three or four small naked children playing on the floor and we had to step over them to get into the room. The room had a bed and a dresser. He lay on his back on the bed and I put a rubber on him and sucked him for a while until he was hard and then I eased on to him. About twenty minutes later there was a knock on the door and it was the woman saying our time was up. I felt kind of guilty because he hadn't come and I offered to reason with the woman and get another ten minutes, but he said it was all right and began dressing. When we were ready to leave the room he stopped me and... hugged me and kissed me on the cheek. He gave me an extra hundred as a tip and went back to his car. I remember being relieved that I wouldn't have to work again that evening.	Last spring I happened to walk past a house that I had once patronized. There was a cool breeze blowing off the ocean and through the window I could see a bare leg. The girl must have been taking a break between customers. It was a strange moment for me because it reminded me of my mother and despite the fact that I was late for something already I just stayed there, loving the atmosphere of it and my memory and... the reason I'm telling you this epilogue is that I felt that I'd come full circle.
2 Where was that house? The one in LA, I mean.	Fifth and Mayflower. You know it?
3 Yes. One of my friends was there. I wonder if you ever clipped her.

1 So... are you alone, or are you just using me to make someone else jealous?	Alone. Alone. I'm here alone.
2 Where are you staying?	Right here at the hotel. Why?
3 Well... I thought you might be looking for a date.	A date. What, are you a hooker?  What do you mean a date?  I've got a wife back home. I just came over to talk for a few minutes.
4 I'm sorry, I guess I misunderstood.

1 Yes? What?	It's me, Yuri.

1 Is he always such an ass?	He's the top defense attorney in the state. Of course he's an ass.
2 But is he an ass that's gonna win my case?	He's an ass that's gonna try.
3 He thinks I'm guilty, doesn't he?	That's not what's important.
4 To me it is. He doesn't trust me. Why should I trust him?

1 Okay -- Ms. Windham, when you uh arrived back at the house? Was your father there?	Not that I saw. But like I said, I went straight upstairs to take a shower.
2 And when you came downstairs, what happened?	I saw Brooke standing over his body, drenched in his blood.
3 But Mrs. Windham didn't have a gun?	No, she'd stashed it by then.

1 All I know is -- it's not Brooke.	That's touching, Elle, but we need an alibi.

1 I do. I'm not allowing it.	But you agreed last night. In the office? When we were discussing my "career"?

1 -- his life?	I don't know.
2 Well, I recommend knowing before speaking. The law leaves much room for interpretation -- but very little for self-doubt.

1 So, this is the only interaction you two have ever had?	No. Sometimes I say "Okay" instead of "Fine".
2 Have you ever considered asking him if he'd like a cold beverage? Or perhaps a neck massage?	What's the point?  Look at me.
3 I am. And I'm looking at a beautiful, fabulous, sexy woman.

1 Warner can't even do his own laundry.	I know. He has it sent out.
2 Did you know he got wait-listed when he applied? His father had to make a call.	You're kidding!

1 We still love you. Sisters forever!	Thank you. I love you, too.

1 Do they just -- put you on the spot like that? Like, all the time?	The professors? Yeah, they tend to do that. Socratic method.
2 And if you don't know the answer, they just kick you out?

1 Damn. We can't see her for an hour?	No, she can't move for an hour.

1 Back up. How do you know he's gay?	Gay men know designers. Straight men don't.

1 How could this happen?	I don't know! I don't know anything any more!  I just need to be by myself.
2 Are you sure?

1 It's pink.	And engraved... Gives it that extra little something, doesn't it?  See you tomorrow!

1 C'mon. Let me take you home.	No.
2 Elle -- it's twenty miles back to campus.

1 If you tell him, you'll probably make summer associate. Who cares about Brooke? Think about yourself.	I gave her my word, Warner.

1 Elle?	Where's the Rock?

1 Fight's over before it's begun... soon the survivors will be in full retreat.	Then we smash 'em?
2 Anything left for smashing you may happily smash.

1 Damn you!	We're both of us damned, my beauty.

1 What you do, boy?  You be velly solly, come here intellupt my sleep.	I didn't know... I --
2 What?  Speakee loud!  No hear velly good.	I said, I mean no harm... I thought this as empty tomb.
3 You come stealee tleasoo?	Oh, no, never... nothing like that... never crossed my mind.
4 No need lie, boy.  I no hurt you. Do I look like I wanna hurt you?	Well, er... no.  I mean, you don't look like dragons I've heard of.
5 Course not.  I no flum here.  I come flum Cathay.	Cathay?
6 Country fa' fa' away.  To the East, beyond the lising sun...	East of Mercia?
7 You got no idee.  People there lookee diffelent; speakee diffelent. Nothing the same.  In my countlee I bling good luck.  Makee lain and thunder.	You don't ravage the countryside, devouring maidens and burning the crops?
8 Dlagon not like that.  Dlagon is spilit of life... spilit of stlength and goodness.	Then you'll understand my quest.  An ogre named Blackheart has killed the last stag unicorn and stolen his horn.  The world outside is cursed, plunged into eternal winter.  Unless I return the alicorn, the earth will be frozen forever.
9 Flozen foleva not good.	It's terrible.
10 An' how you do it?  How you rift cuss?	I need your help.  In order to fight Blackheart, I must wear the armor of Achilles.  I --
11 You come stealee tleasoo?	Oh no... Don't you understand?

1 Why, Jack-lad, she likes you, is all.  And what hot-blooded hero wouldn't welcome the affections of a fair nymph like Oona here...?  If your blood runs so cold, boy, you be a corpse before your time.	What does she want from me?

1 Better pray the worm's a sound sleeper, Jack.	You do the praying.  I've work ahead.
2 There's the spirit, lad.  If ye run into trouble, give a yank here and we'll haul ye up.	What's left of me... How do I recognize the armor of Achilles?
3 You'll know it when you see it... tis a splendid sight, all covered with gold... Don't fear making noise.  Dragons be deaf as tree stumps.

1 We must follow that bird.	Whatever for?
2 Jenny Greenteeth said:  "Follow the raven in her flight..."	Aye.  Said to follow it to the edge of night.  But is this the right bird?
3 I'm sure.  It spoke to me.	Birds speak to me all the time. What did it say?
4 Beware.	Sounds like the bird we want.  All right lads, follow yon raven!

1 My God!  Look!	Something the matter?
2 Ogg's footprints!

1 Archers!  Bring down that spider! I'll deal with this other creature...	Stay on your guard, Jack.  The bug is enchanted surely.

1 That be so, better you pinch yourself now, Jack.	On the morrow I'll be awake enough to see if dreams come true.
2 Pray they don't turn out to be nightmares.

1 The kitchen be the most important room in a palace, for if the victuals ain't right, little else is likely to be so.	Did you bring me here to sup?
2 Nay, lad, we're here to collect a weapon you'll need fighting the Baron.	What weapon?
3 Sunlight.	Plan on carrying some away in a kettle?
4 Easier than that, Jack.  Screwball!  Fetch me down a couple of them plates.

1 You must find the ring... It completes the cycle; answers the riddle...	I'll try.
2 You're good at riddles... Find the ring and the spell is broken.

1 Someone like Floki... or Squarefoot... or --	You'll do it because I am you liege and I command you to do it!

1 Oh, dear.	What's the matter?
2 I've lost my napkin.  It was all elf-work and lace... I must have dropped it when you startled me so.	I'll go search for it.
3 Don't leave me now.  I fear the unicorn won't show himself without you.	I'm not its master.
4 The napkin will keep.  I'd rather not be alone.	Your command is my wish, Princess Lili.

1 I thought you were dead... I --	I was bewitched... it's better this way...
2 They told me you were dead.

1 Think me fair, do you, Jack?	The moon herself would hide behind a cloud rather than dare comparison with you...
2 The moon is too round of face, methinks.	The sight of you makes flowers seem like dross.  All the heavenly angels must envy your grace.
3 I like well your conceit, Jack.  Tis rare to find an honest lad in this troubled world.	Aye.  And it is the trouble befallen us that brings me here.  I entreat you to tell me the cause of our surrounding sorrow, most lovely of the lovely.
4 Dear lad, what does winter bespeak but death?  It is a time of mourning.  This calamity is a curse. Something wondrous and beautiful has been taken from the world.	A unicorn's been slain.  The last stallion in all the country.
5 Why then, there thou hast.  We be lucky worse has not befallen us.

1 What care I for the human heart! Such a soft, spiritless thing it is. I prefer the hearts of hawks and wolves; fierce and free and keen as steel!	And as barren of love as stone.
2 I would build a wall around me with such stone, so the likes of you might never enter.	Be fair, Oona.
3 You beware, Jack!  You and your porridge-pot heart!

1 What care the bones when the soul is free?	Bah!  You faeries have the morals of ferrets.

1 No hurt Jimmy, sir... oh no, please, sir...	I'm sending you back to Hell!

1 Dad's disappeared!	He was there and then he wasn't!

1 What's that for?	Mom said I should.
2 Oh.	I would have anyway.

1 I'd be more comfortable if he slept in the guestroom.	I'd be more comfortable if you hadn't slept with Josh.  And George would be more comfortable if he weren't dying.

1 You have to ask like that?	I want you to try something with me, okay?
2 I've taken a lot of morphine.  Oral morphine...for my back.  Can I wait till I can say no and sound convincing?

1 Josh and I are going to South Coast. Wanna ride?  Maybe see a movie?	No thanks.

1 Hey, I can get you three hundred cash for two hours.	What?

1 I wouldn't want you as a friend.	George just never really...aimed that high.  Even with not hitting a rabbit.  I knew you were doing that, by the way. That's why I stopped doing it with you. You were no fun.  It was always like you were frightened.  Quiet and boring.

1 I'm good, thanks.	What are you on?
2 Pardon me?	how much weight have you lost?
3 Oh...nothing.  Thirty pounds.  I just haven't been very hungry.	How's your wife?
4 When we divorce a decade ago, she was very, very angry.  Now she's just hostile.

1 Is Alyssa home?	She's out with a friend.
2 Oh...do you know when she'll be home?	She didn't really say.
3 Oh...okay.

1 I never said anything.  I haven't done anything.	I know what the deal is.  Josh is a pimp. I'm not stupid.
2 You don't know what the deal is.  There is no fucking deal.

1 Do you ever get like the slightest inkling that you might want to help me instead of doing absolutely nothing?	No.
2 Get the inkling, Sam.  I'm getting tired of your attitude.

1 I've been using since I was twelve! You're all so unbelievably stupid.  You didn't give a shit about anything I did until now!	I'll apologize for everything but today...Today I give a shit.
2 You're too fucking late.	The gloves on the table are for you.
3 You can't make me do a thing.	Sit down for a second.
4 No.

1 I wish you had told me then.	I'm telling you now.
2 I gave up on you.	I'd be in Tahoe having fun if you had given up.
3 What would you be doing now?	Getting high, I guess.
4 If I asked you to stop, would you?	I haven't used anything for two days. I'm trying.
5 I'm proud of you, Sam.	Don't be.  And hide whatever that new drug is you have.  I like it.

1 I don't wanna go, Sam.	Here.

1 Ah!  Oh....	I know there's an explanation.

1 What are you doing?	He doesn't answer.

1 George --	He's not spending the entire summer with another kid in Tahoe.  If he leaves, I will follow him up there and I will drag him home by his nose ring.  He can hate me.  You can hate me.  He can try to kill me while I sleep.  You can call the police.  You can call your husband or your attorney, but Sam is spending the summer with me.  He's my son.  He's sixteen.  That's it.

1 With your hands or your tongue?	You're not well.

1 I know they're not much help, but they love coming here, George.	How much time do they get to spend with their dad?
2 What is it with this?  They wouldn't spend less time with Peter if they lived here!  He has no time!

1 Don't move!	I'm an idiot to have you up there.

1 I don't have a clue anymore.  I wish you'd talk to him.  He needs a man.	His father is a man.
2 A man he respects.

1 I was talking about our marriage.	I know.

1 Hey.	Hey.
2 You got a dog?	It's not ours.  It's George's.

1 All day again?	Not all day.  I'll be home after lunch.

1 Don't take it so hard, Biscuit. She don't mean nothin' to him.	Hell with him. It ain't that.

1 I apologize, Claude. That was rude of me.	That's alright, boss. Takes a lot more than a colorful brochure to hurt my feelings.
2 You been on the farm for quite a spell, haven't you?	Over forty years now. Me and Ray Gibson out there.

1 For the kind of money they charge here, you'd think they could hire somebody to actually wash the dishes.	Claude. Here's to your new job down at the bank. I always knew you'd make something of yourself.
2 Know what I'm going to buy with my first pay check?

1 Here, this belongs to you.  It was empty when I found it.	Good old Monroe.

1 Thanks for backing me up here, Uncle Claude.	Don't Uncle Claude me. You get a load of those crackers? Couldn't be a mouthful of teeth among the bunch of 'em. Why you want to pick a fight with people like that for?
2 You're soft.	What'd you say?

1 Life?! How long is life? We were just walking back to the truck. We didn't do nothing! Fuck life!	Life?! What's life mean? There's no way I can do life. I got a job starts Monday morning!

1 Maynard Banks, Esquire. Attorney at law.	Gimme that. That doesn't concern you.
2 I'm sure it don't.

1 We'll just get off at the next stop.	Say what?
2 That's right, we'll get off at the next stop. The train's pulling into the station right now.	The hell you talking about? What train?
3 We're in the Bronx, my man. Hundred and Sixty First Street.

1 Let it go, Claude.	I'm not gonna let it go. The man needs to explain himself. Makin' promises.

1 Wilkins' driver's got the flu, so he asked me to fill in for him.	You haven't driven in 40 years, you ain't even got a license. Man's taking his life in his hands, putting you behind the wheel! Where you taking him?
2 Greenville. We're picking up the new Superintendent at the bus station.

1 Are you trying to tell me after all this time you finally have a plan for busting out of here?	Shh! Is that so hard to believe?
2 Don't tell me, I don't want to hear it. It's probably all fucked up, anyway.	You don't want to hear it, you don't want to hear it. There's no shame in that.
3 It's too late for plans.	Never thought I'd hear Ray Gibson say that. Hell with you then. You'd only slow me down anyway.

1 At least he didn't kill Santa Claus with his bare hands.	You killed Santa Claus?

1 We don't need no fences at Camp 8, boss.	That's right. We don't need no fences, we have the gun line. It runs from shack to shack clear around the yard. You are now inside the gun line...

1 That musta messed 'em up pretty bad.	What happened to 'em after that, Willie?

1 I can't take that, mama.	Don't argue with me. You need it more than I do. I know how a little money can help in a place like this.

1 Besides, why bother with bootlegging when we got us a clear cut case of murder?	Excuse me, sheriff. As we explained to your associate here, there's been a mistake. We didn't kill anybody. Now, as for the bootlegging, we happen to work for a very important man in New York.

1 Who?	Satchmo.

1 Man, that music is hot. What goes on down there, Slim?	That's Natchez-under-the-Hill.
2 Blacks welcome there?	Green's the only color that matters under the hill. They got gambling, girls. You oughta check it out.
3 Maybe we will. Nice meeting you.

1 Of course I can. Drink or she dies.  Unlike you, she won't come back from where she's going.	Let her go.
2 I hear a train coming. Drink.

1 Hello, Cassius.	All right. Let me out.
2 You know, New Hell really only needs one new Satan.	You mother...

1 I remember that night, you had like four daiquiris.	Try four and a half. At first I totally didn't like him.

1 How did you see me?	We can see what's going on anywhere on Earth. Look.

1 They castrated him. He can't shoot arrows, he can't piss smoke.	I can't screw.  I can't screw.

1 All that running and chasing is making the sleep thing want to come early.	I think we have to work on narrowing down our list of suspects. Now I'm going to go check in with some of my contacts uptown.

1 No, no, that's not what I said. He can keep his thumbs, but the fingers gotta go.	Oh, and don't forget, you're shoving a pineapple up Hitler's ass at four o'clock.

1 This is bad, Nicky.	How bad?
2 I'm gonna die, Nicky. If the gates are broken, no new souls can get in, which means I'll start to deteriorate into nothing.

1 Hey.	That's a pretty brassiere.
2 Thanks.	Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
3 You got it. Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?	You got it.

1 I was in love one time but she said I wasn't financially reliable enough. And she needed that.	By she, do you mean he?
2 No.

1 You sure you're down with this?	Little nervous. Wanna puke.

1 I'm not Nicky. I'm not home! I don't live here!	Dude, it's us. Let us in.

1 I'd love to have a dog. But I go to school full time. It wouldn't be fair to the dog.	School?
2 Parsons School of Design. I knew growing up I wasn't much to look at, so I put my energy into making things that are pretty.	What's that pleasant smell coming from, your skin?
3 My perfume?

1 Can we go fly over Central Park?	Next time. Tonight, I want to share the most beautiful thing I could possibly imagine.

1 It looks like the work of a brother...	A black guy?
2 If it's Cassius, yes.

1 We're hungry do you have anything to eat?	Anything to eat?

1 I designed it myself.  What'll it be... a face job or a full-body job?	Just the face.
2 Fine... Holly will get you ready. You're in good hands, believe me.

1 You missed something special.	Well... you can't have them all.

1 It's him! The first Sandman. He killed... Doc.	No, Holly -- wait! He's running. Tell them the rest!
2 He's the one. You too. I remember. He was in a hurry. Just a face job. Dark hair, I said. Then he killed Doc and you grabbed me -- and the machine blew up and I ran... I ran.	Holly. Holly! Please... The other Sandman. Remember the one who came after --

1 You can have any woman in the city. What do you really want?	You know.
2 I don't believe you. There has to be more.	All right.

1 I'm ashamed. I was bringing you to be killed.	Where? Sanctuary? Can you take me there?
2 Logan, I don't know where Sanctuary is. But if I take you to them, they'll kill you.	All right. But why? I didn't kill the Runner.
3 Yes, but they won't know that... or care. They're hunting you, Logan. Maybe me too, now...	That's nothing... there's a Sandman behind us, too and there'll be more soon. Take me to them.
4 I -- I can't.	Then -- why don't you leave me -- go to them -- explain
5 No. Not that either.

1 Don't!	Sooner or later, we'll have to try something.

1 Look at his face... and his hair...  Is that what it is to grow old?	It could be...

1 What kind of jewel is this?	I don't know.
2 You're both full of secrets like Macavity.  Did you steal this?	No.
3 "Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity, There never was a cat of such deceitfulness and suavity."

1 How did you get here?	I have always been here...
2 Are there any other humans?	Gracious... no.
3 Have any other people ever passed through?

1 Is that really it? It doesn't seem very far. Will we be there soon?	I promise. We'll go on as soon as it's light.

1 This rod is a fuckin', embarrassment, Carl. Whatiya burn in this thing, "V"?	Texaco... What's wrong with that?
2 Listen.	You gotta be kiddin'... This is the boulevard... You can't hear yourself think.

1 Why not?	I forgot. Anyway, I hate the idea of acting paranoid.

1 Now we'll see what this son of a bitch is up to.	Yeah.

1 He'll kill us.	Are you positive he knows?
2 I'm not positive... but... he knows.	So what do we do?
3 I don't know.	We should stop seeing each other.
4 No... no.

1 Alice...	We gotta get the stuff and get out of here.

1 You don't look so good.	I gotta headache... What's goin' on?
2 The police called us.	Yeah? what did they want?
3 They wanted to know if we'd had a chance to find out what happened to you the other night. They wanted to know if you remembered anything.	But I don't remember anything. What did you tell 'em?

1 Repeat that, Bill.	Warden, it's not him. It was not Fred Madison in that cell.
2 Of course, it's Madison!!! Who else could it be?	I don't know. The guards say they've never seen him before.
3 Where is he now?	He's in the infirmary, being examined.
4 Did you ask him who he is?	He... He can't talk. it appears as if he can't talk, anyway.
5 If he's not Madison, then where's Madison?	I've got men searching the building and the grounds now.

1 Do you remember?	No... I don't. Why?

1 That's it.	Let's have a look at the hallway outside the bedroom.

1 It's nice to know I can still make you laugh.	I like to laugh, Fred.
2 That's why I married you.	Wake me up when you get home.

1 We will.	Thanks, guys.

1 Did you see that about the guy who chopped up his wife into a million pieces?	How could I miss it? The TV won't quit with that stuff.
2 They're gonna cook him.	Andy's from Utah. He says there you have a choice... You can die by hanging or by firing squad.
3 Which would you choose?

1 How ya doin', Pete?	Okay.
2 I'm sure you noticed that girl that was with me the other day... Good lookin' blonde? She stayed in the car?...

1 What's happening to you? What happened to your face?	I don't know.
2 What do you mean?... You've been acting strange lately... Like the other night.	What night?
3 Last time I saw you.	I don't remember... What happened that night?
4 You sure weren't acting like the Pete Dayton I've always known.	Whatiya mean?
5 You were acting like a different person.

1 Cable from Gainsford.	Oh, read it!
2 "Leaving today for London with Conway aboard S.S. Manchuria. Conway can tell nothing of his experiences. Is suffering from complete loss of memory. Signed, Gainsford."

1 Sorry.	This is the only thing I was able to save when those heathens surrounded me.
2 Uh-huh.	You see, from this vertebrae I shall be able to reconstruct the entire skeleton.
3 Wait a minute, you expect to be knighted for finding that soupbone?	It was the vertebrae of a Megatherium - found in Asia.
4 Yeah, I remember. You said that before.	Sir Henry Derwent was knighted, and he never got beyond the mesozoic era.

1 Something tells me this means food. Come on!	I just feel as though I'm being made ready for the executioner.

1 Yeah. You know.	Horns? What kind of horns?

1 Hey, hurry up, you slow-pokes - I'm starved!	Please! Please! Do not wait for me! I eat so very little.

1 Hey - look!	Look, Bob!

1 But Mr. Chang, all these things - books, instruments, sculpture - do you mean to say they were all brought in over those mountains by porters?	They were.
2 Well, it must have taken	Centuries.
3 Centuries! Where did you get the money to pay for all those treasures?	Of course we have no money as you know it. We do not buy or sell or seek personal fortunes because, well, because there is no uncertain future here for which to accumulate it.

1 You know, it's very, very strange, but when you saw me in the corridor, I was actually on my way to you. I bring the most amazing news.  The High Lama wishes to see you, Mr. Conway.	The High Lama! Who in blazes is he?!

1 No, I can't! I can't! You've got to let me rest! You've got to let me rest!	Hey!

1 All right, go ahead!  We go on to the next plane. Bring out any people that are left.	Right, Bob.

1 Oh George, come on.	It's not knowing that's so awful, Bob. Not knowing where you're going, or why, or what's waiting when you get there.

1 What about the porters?	Porters?
2 Didn't you find out anything about the porters?	Why - I'm sorry - but I

1 So everyone is serenely happy in Shangri-La? Nobody would ever think of leaving?  It's all just so much rot! She's pleaded with me ever since I came here to take her away from this awful place. She's cried in my arms for hours, for fear I'd leave her behind. And what's more, she's made two trips to the plateau to bribe the porters - for me!	I don't believe it! I don't believe a word of it!
2 All right. I'll prove it to you! You believe everything they've told you - without proof! I'll prove my story!

1 I guess we're in for it.	In for what?
2 I don't know. He must have had some purpose in taking the plane away from Fenner.  When he lands, we'll find out.	You mean to tell me you're not going to do anything until we land?
3 What do you suggest?	Why, you - you Look here - he may dash us to pieces!
4 It might afford you a great deal of relief.  Now gentlemen, I'm going back to sleep. Oh, and I was having such a peaceful dream.  As soon as he lands, let me know.

1 I'm thirty.	Oh, you're going to make life very simple.

1 Why, he's speaking English.	English!

1 So... this door.  It's... not an exit...  ?	It's not even a fucking door.

1 From now on, you'll respond only to the name "Jay." You'll dress in appropriate attire specially sanctioned by the INS Special Services. You're not to stand out in any way.  Understand?	Yes, sir.

1 Kay, listen, I dunno what got into--	Don't worry about it.  It's been a long night.  Speaking of which-- you owe me a cup of coffee, remember?

1 Well, how about if I guess, then? Black: Vast space.  Deep. Spiritual. The essence of infinity.	We wear black.
2 Oh. Right.  I guess that's kind of cool, too, in it's own way.  Course, this isn't really black; it's kind of a dull, dirty, tarry sort of noncolor, isn't it?

1 what's this?	It's an Edna named after Zed's ex wife.  All you do is at the target. The scope matches the image with the image on your retina. The barrel will find the target on its own.

1 Jesus Christ...	We're rising.

1 We saw it in the office.  It went from this big...    to big...   in a day.	Well, if the bugs have hatched, and they're not here... then where are they?

1 Yeah.  His dream and our worst nightmare.	You know, there's something we never really thought of...

1 When?	It would've had to have been recently-- within a few weeks.
2 So... how did they get here?

1 Pardon me.  I hate to break up this lovely little group hug, but we people aren't ready for what we have.  How is this going to help?	How could it not?
2 Why don't you ask the Mosebacke?     Brazil. Until 44 years ago they ate with their hands, lived in huts, and didn't even know the rest of the world existed. 44 years ago a well intentioned missionary gave them a fork.  Today, they don't exist.	Come on now.  People are smart.
3 No-- a Person is smart.  People are dumb.    And the more people you put together, the dumber they get.  And you know that.

1 Found it.	Tell us the truth.  You don't just find these things, at least not in this neighborhood.
2 I promised I wouldn't tell.

1 How's Dee?	Fine.  Good.

1 Yeah?  What's up?	I got a planet check on that bug.  It's from way the hell out in the third belt. it's organic, formed in the same blast that made our solar system.

1 Drop some money.	Forget that guy --
2 Do it.  Right here.  On the ground.

1 Can't you see?  She just wanted her little girl back.	Who wanted her little girl back?
2 The drowning woman.  Anne... But it was too late.  Her little girl was already gone.	She died?
3 She grew up.	She's still alive?

1 You don't remember me, do you?	We know each other?
2 Oh, yes.

1 That's an old one.  One of our first.	This is the official composite of the three precogs?
2 That's right.  It's a combined data stream based on all three previsions.	Show me just Agatha's data stream.
3 For that, we have to go for a ride.

1 And this is exactly the kind of behavior that will give them an excuse to do it.	Lamar, I'm sorry.  I don't know what --
2 Don't apologize, John.

1 John --	I just wanted to congratulate you. You did it.  You've created a world without murder.  So what if you had to kill someone to do it.

1 Got him in the Foxhall.  4421 Gainsborough.	Send a DCPD blue & white out there, set up a perimeter and tell 'em we're en route.  What's our confirmed time?
2 From solar position, Trig & Image confirms it at approximately eight oh-four a.m.

1 Uh, yeah, you mind getting me a piece of that cake they're eating down there?  I'm starving.	Sure, Chief.  I think I'll grab one for myself while I'm at it...
2 Take your time.

1 At least now you -- and I -- have the chance to make sure that kind of thing doesn't happen to anyone ever again.	Why don't you cut the cute act, Danny, and tell me exactly what it is you're looking for?
2 Flaws.	There hasn't been a murder in six years.  There's nothing wrong with the system.  It's perfect.
3 I agree.  The system is perfect. If there's a flaw, it's human.  It always is.  Thank you for the tour, Wally.

1 Are these all of her previsions?	There's no way of knowing for sure. She could've forgotten whatever it is you're looking for...

1 I scored a goal!	That's great.

1 Where've you got him?  Is he all right?  Tell me, you fuck -- WHERE IS HE?!	I put him in a barrel and sunk him in the bay.

1 You have three minutes to tell me what you're doing here before I feed you to a few of my more predacious plants.	I'm... not... a... killer.

1 John?	He's dead, Lara.
2 Oh, God, what did you do?	Nothing.  I didn't kill him.
3 Then how did he --	Lara, I don't know why this is happening.  I just know they're setting me up.  I can't trust anybody.  I don't know who to talk to or where to go...  Lara?  Are you there?

1 Sir, the press conference is starting.	I'll be right there.

1 Now the second image.  Watch the water.  The wind's changed.  The ripples are going the other way.	I don't understand --
2 This murder is happening at two different times.

1 Crime of passion.  No premeditation.  They show up late. Most of our scrambles are flash events like this one.  We rarely see anything with premeditation anymore.	People have gotten the message.  Gum?

1 There a maid in this hotel?	I don't know, why?
2 If you were a child killer, you took these pictures, would you leave them out on the bed for anyone to find?	They could have been put away. Anderton could have found them.
3 What kind of cop were you before this?	I was a Treasury Agent for eight years.  Why?
4 Treasury... Then this would be your first actual murder scene.

1 Howard --	I forgot my glasses.

1 They've never been separated before.	What does he want with a precog?
2 What do you think?  So he can kill whoever he wants to without anyone knowing about it.	But there's still the other two.

1 I don't know about you guys, but I'm starting to feel a really sexual vibe here.	What happened? I thought we were playing Truth or Dare.
2 Look at, ladies. I could sit here and take turns throwing skittles at your ass all night. But I feel what you guys are putting out there. I'm only a mirror reflecting what I'm getting from you. And I'm saying yes to it. I'm shaking hands with it. I see the road that you're pointing down and I'm saying I'll ride shotgun. And when your foot slams on the accelerator, I won't get scared. I'll stand up and let the wind blow through my long blonde hair. With my summer dress clinging to my bosom yelling 'Faster, Billy! Faster! Drive faster! Faster yet -- !'

1 It's a poison arrow tree frog.	Will you paint the damn thing. Why do you gotta be such a baby.

1 She needs a family. A dad. I'll give her what you never had.	Don't get my hopes up. If I quit, what then? I can't go through this again.

1 He making the drop?	Nah, man. He's just making contact. That's our man. The Welsh guy.
2 What's his name?	Ruiz don't like using names on cell phones. He refers to him as the Red Dragon.
3 So, when's the drop.	To be honest, man, I don't know shit either. All I know is it ain't drugs and it ain't now.

1 Yeah. Sure.	How 'bout this. If you're in, he's in.
2 I gotta tell you, Mr. Reuben, I'm not comfortable getting in any deeper. It's one thing to look after Jess...	You're ready to move up. Christ, the way you busted up the place, you're doing worse already. May as well get paid instead of punished.
3 It's not that I don't appreciate the offer...	Do me a favor. Think about it. Is that too much too ask?
4 No. Okay. I'll think about it.

1 What's the plan?	Tom, the Welsh dude --

1 Aren't we waiting for Ricky?	Ricky's taken care of.
2 Taken care of?	Yeah, he's getting there on his own.

1 We look good this year.	We'll kill Fairfax this year.
2 I still can't believe you missed the fucking team bus.	Fuck him.
3 Your first start at DB, it's against Fairfax, and you miss the fucking bus.	What are we delivering?
4 We're not delivering shit. Ruiz is delivering something, and whatever it is is his business.	Who is this fucking Ruiz?
5 Maxie says he runs a tight ship. I wouldn't fuck with him.	Some Mexican? How much could he weigh? A buck fifty, tops? I'd kick his fucking ass.
6 I gotta pick up the baby.	Why do you always get stuck taking care of the kid.
7 I like it.	It's not even yours.
8 I like it.

1 Shit. No new pages. I don't even know where the fuck we're supposed to go.	Maybe we should call for a cab.
2 No. Look. There.

1 So is this the drop?	Like I said, I don't know.
2 He woulda told us right?	You would think.

1 Put that shit out...	C'mon, man...
2 I swear to God, I'll fucking puke.	Hey, Jimmy, where they taking us?
3 Yeah. Where they gonna whack us?

1 C'mon...	Fuck...

1 Yes?	Yeah, uh, what's the movie?
2 It's in your copy of Hemispheres. I believe it's Mickey Blue Eyes.	Ugh...
3 I'll get you the list of videos, if you don't mind, I'll offer the other passengers a beverage.	Yeah, sure. How much are they?
4 How much is what?	The videos.
5 You're up front. Everything's free up here.

1 I'm half Irish.	I don't fuck with those crazy, off- the-boat fuckin Irish. You heard of the Westies?.

1 Yeah.	Jimmy? Ruiz. Pick up Maxie's guineas at LUNA and bring them to Spa.  Jimmy's bringing the car around. Me and Ho rode sleds. We'll meet you at Spa in the VIP room.

1 Can I borrow a piece of --	Go ahead. Open the fuckin things. You should each find fifteen hundred --

1 No...	Four mimosas.  You'll love them. So here's the plan. I didn't say shit to Maxie, cause the man has acute angina, and I don't want to get him all worked up.
2 He has a cute what...?

1 I'm working trains. Selling.	Bet you like that shit.
2 Keeps me out of the army.	When they want your ass, won't nothing keep you out.
3 Not this boy... I ain't fighting their war. I got my own. Right chere. Heard tell you're a good man to know.	Heard where?
4 Where I come from. Boston.

1 I told you less paper, less trouble.	I'm working on it.
2 I keep all my numbers in my head. I've never written any down.

1 And every cat's watching, ain't they? It's a toe-down.	That's what it is. Walk on out.
2 Let Billie finish.	Now.

1 Leggo. I got to wash it out.	Let it burn. Maybe you'll hear me then.

1 You pitch, baby; I'll ketch.	The first men on earth were black. They ruled and there was not one white face anywhere. But they teach us that we lived in caves and swung from trees. Black men were never like that.

1 Now about our coming up in the world a little. You're not naive. You're a man of the world. The Movement's grown; we've grown with it. You know folks. They want their leaders to be prosperous. One hand washes the other.	"I'm telling you God's words, not to hustle."
2 You want a new car? You want a new house? Is that it? It's the money, right?

1 Sure I'll speak to your class. But I'm a hard man on women. You want to know why?	If you want to tell me.

1 It won't be easy.	Just hold me.
2 It will be rough.	Hush your mouth.
3 I'll be away a lot.	You're with me even when you're away.

1 Malcolm, they keep calling, threatening us. I'm going crazy, when is this going to stop?	Don't answer the phone. It's all right. It's all right. Nothing is gonna happen to anybody.
2 Dear heart, where are you?	At the Hilton. The girls asleep?
3 I just put them to bed. Can we come to the meeting tomorrow?	I don't think that's such a good idea.

1 Now just a moment, just a moment --	But we do know that the people of that region of Asia Minor, from the Tigris-Euphrates valley to the Mediterranean, are dark-skinned people. I've studied drawings and photographs and seen newsreels. I have never seen a native of that area who was not black.
2 Just what are you saying?	I'm not saying anything, preacher. I'm proving to you that God is black.

1 She know?	If she got eyes, she do.

1 How many you turning out?	500.
2 Make it 1000. We got a lot of fishing to do.	Brother Malcolm, I want you to meet Brother Earl. He just joined the Nation.

1 Baby, I was gonna give it to you.	Well, bitch you move too slow.

1 That ain't bad.	Tell him about Baldy.

1 Who the hell are they?	Brothers of Brother Johnson.
2 Eddie, let's see that blotter.

1 My country needs justice. Proper justice. Gunning men down in the street only feeds the violence. They need to be brought to trial. Dealt with properly. Then people will respect the law. When they see it works.	So you are going to talk me to death.
2 You walk out and deal justice. You're what I wish I could be.  The policemen who kills you, his family will have all they want.	Then I hope the one who gets me has got lots of kids. What do you want?
3 I want to arrest you for murder! I want to shake your hand and reload your gun! I want to kill my pride and give you my blessing.	My deal is with Rosanna. I knew you guys were up to something. Are you two fucking?
4 No, but I have to admit I thought about it.	Liar. Just tell me who the bank card belongs to. Name and address.
5 You have no interest in making things easy, do you?	I'm not... easy.

1 Another favor... get me banking info on Jordan Kalfus. U.S. deposits or withdrawals. Thanks. Oh, get me the same on Samuel Ramos.	How do I contact you? We still don't have the ATM info.
2 You don't, I'll call you. Oh! I have a tape recording that I am sure will interest you.

1 [She's late, Mr. Creasy.]	[Yeah, I've got to get used to the routes. I -- It won't happen again.]
2 [No offense, but I'm sorry that your profession needs to exist.]	[So am I, Sister.]
3 [Do you ever see the hand of God in what you do?]	[Not for a long time, sister.]
4 [The bible says, "Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good."]	[Romans, chapter 12, verse 21.]

1 [The most important thing in life is family. And there you are. You have my family. What do you want?]	[I want you.]
2 [This is not possible. But in that house I have money. If I tell you where --]	[Your brother wants to talk to you.]

1 What is it?	Nine millimeter. A Sig Sauer 226.
2 Have you used this type before?

1 Your Spanish is good enough. You certainly look the part.	You're crazy. People would hire a has-been, Ray? A drunk?
2 Well, you'd have to keep it under control.	And what if, just say, there was a kidnap attempt?
3 You do your best. They won't be paying you enough to perform miracles.

1 I'll take the .45 and the Webley .32.	I know it's old fashioned, but it's reliable. Like us.

1 Hmmm?	It wasn't a school like yours and there was no Sister Anna.
2 So you were unhappy?	Being unhappy is a state of mind. I never thought about it.
3 Oh...

1 Did you sleep alright?	Yes.
2 How's the ankle? Can you put your weight on it?	It's not too bad. Will it take a long time before it's better? Our big swim meet is in three weeks. Interschools. I was going to swim in the one hundred meter freestyle.
3 In a week you should be fine.

1 I'm not afraid you, Creasy.	I know you're not.
2 Are you afraid of me?

1 You've done much of this work before?	Never.

1 Creasy... Wait.	Stay here. If you do something stupid, we won't get her back.

1 Good news. You're going back to school.	When?
2 Samuel is going to hire a new bodyguard. It may take a few days, but you're going back.

1 He has experience in related work. A great deal of it.	Do you have any family, Mr. Creasy?

1 [Then what do you have to lose?]	[It's a moral issue. On one hand you're cleaning up the bad guys, but in another way we are feeding the problem that produces bad guys.]

1 I told you she wasn't especially attractive, but that she had a good deal of charm, and she's really a real nice girl...	She's all right, Andy. It's just that I get one Saturday night off every three weeks, and I was expecting something better, that's all.
2 I told you she wasn't attractive...	You told me that she was a little tall, but that she wasn't bad looking at all.
3 Millie's been after me to fix her up with a date, so I...	All right, I'm having a fair time. It's just that I get one Saturday night off in three weeks, and I wanted to wind up with something tonight.

1 We gotta whole pot inna kitchen. We give you a plate-a your own.	Oh, I couldn't eat nothing. My mother just stuffed me right up to the jaws.

1 I wake up this morning, I hear the baby crying. So I wake up. I come in their room. That girl is shaking her hand atta baby. I said, "You brute! Don't you strike that baby! That's my son's baby!"	It's her baby too, you know.
2 That's my son Thomas's baby.	Well, it ain't your baby.
3 Did I tell you she threw the bottle- a milk at me?	You told me.
4 She's a witch, that one. I tell you what happen yesterday?	What happen?
5 She gave me the evil eye.

1 ...you teach chemistry? That's funny. Where? What school?	Benjamin Franklin High School.
2 Benjamin Franklin, where's that? Brooklyn? I went to Theodore Roosevelt right up here on Fordham Road. It's right arounna corner from my house. I have a cousin who's a teacher. He teaches Latin. He lives in Chicago. He was studying to be a Jesuit, but he gave it up after his first vows.

1 Siddown, take off your coat. You want something to eat? We gotta whole half-chicken in the icebox.	No, thank you. I don't think I should stay very long.
2 Sure. Just take off your coat a minute.

1 No, thank you, really, Mrs. Pilletti.	It's a very sad business, I tell you. A woman, fifty-six years old, all her life, she had her own home. Now she's just an old lady, sleeping on her daughter-in-law's couch. It's a curse to be a mother, I tell you. Your children grow up and then what is left for you to do? What is a mother's life but her children? It is a very cruel thing when your son has no place for you in his home.
2 Couldn't she find some sort of hobby to fill out her time?	Hobby! What can she do? She cooks and she cleans. You gotta have a house to clean. You gotta have children to cook for. These are the terrible years for a woman, the terrible years.
3 You mustn't feel too harshly against her daughter-in-law. She also wants to have a house to clean and a family to cook for.

1 What I like about Mickey Spillane is he knows how to handle women. In one book, he picks up a tomato who gets hit with a car, and she throws a pass at him. And then he meets two beautiful twins, and they throw passes at him. And then he meets some beautiful society leader, and she throws a pass at him, and...	Boy, that Mickey Spillane, he sure can write.

1 Hello, Ma.	Marty, Thomas and Virginia are here. They had another fight with your Aunt Catherine. So they ask me, would it be all right if Catherine come to live with us. So I said, all right with me, but we have to ask you. Marty, she's a lonely old lady. Nobody wants her. Everybody's throwing her outta their house...
2 Sure, Ma, it's okay with me.	You gotta good heart.

1 Hello, Ma, waddaya say, it's getting a little late.	Sure.

1 Waddaya mean, Ralph?	Hey, Louise, I want you to meet Marty Pilletti. Marty, that's Louise Kelly, inna back seat there.
2 Hiya.

1 He says okay, it's all right Catherine comes here.	Oh, Marty, thanks a lot. That really takes a load offa my mind.

1 Listen, let's go downa Kaplans' apartment. They told us to come down.	Sure, sure.

1 There's sort of a built-in prayer for the sick man to get well, but of course that's not the basic intention.	I don't care about the intention. I just know your Cross Action is a plus on our side. I've seen it come through four times.

1 Yes, O'Reilly?	How you, Radar?

1 Okay, I'm a witness, but how do you prove who's right?	There's only one way.

1 So long, Ho-Jon.	You make a mean martini, kid.

1 Well, there it is. Jesus!	The spot we picked to spend the winter. Maybe we ought to look a little harder.

1 Must be Painlees Pole Day in the Shower Tent.	You met him. Walt Waldowski, the Dental Officer.
2 Nice guy, for an enamel surgeon.

1 Where the hell we going to get us a football team?	All three of us played for our schools. And there are at least four other guys...

1 Hell, man, that don't matter. We're loaded. We were big wheels in the black market in Seoul.	Plus running the opium concession for the whole Eighth Army.

1 I was just asking...	Shut up or I'll tear you apart.

1 A-negative. I've cross-matched it.	I though you said we didn't have a drop.
2 I found a doner.

1 Or you can let him knock himself out. You personally'd be sending him to his grave.	An eternal damnation.

1 Did I ever tell you about Me Lay Marston?	Your high school friend who went around saying 'Me lay, you lay?' to all the young females in the community. As I remember, you said it was quite a successful approach.
2 Well, he wouldn't score more than once in seven or eight tries, but the important thing was he didn't waste time socializing. Anyway, Trapper John, this is Me Lay.

1 I can't feel it now either. The mother must have gone in.	I don't get it.
2 It was in the cava and the hole sealed itself off. I must have jiggled it just enough to turn it loose. I can't feel it in the heart or the right pulmonary artery. So it's in the left pulmonary artery.	What do we do?
3 We'll have to close this hole and make one on the other side.	Be kind of rough on him if there's no blood. Why don't we close up and sit on him a couple of days?
4 Sure, that's the right way... at John Hopkins or someplace. But how do we know there won't be even more of a jam-up a few days from now? Maybe we won't be able to get to him when we want to. Maybe the goddam thing'll erode the artery when nobody's looking. Our best shot is now.

1 The bastards outconned us.	I think we could still have a chance.
2 If you start the game instead of waiting, you mean?	No, let's stick to that strategy till we see whether you boys can do two things. The first is get that halfback out of the game. He had one year with the Rams before the Army got him, but he didn't play too often because he's one of those hot dogs.

1 He should come to now for a while, but he's got so much dope in him by tomorrow he won't know fact from fantasy.	You think he won't.
2 What do you care? You'll be on your way to Japan.	I'm fond of Painless, and I'd feel terrible if anything happened to him...
3 It's your decision, Maria. I don't want to high-pressure you.	I'd be crazy to think my virtue, such as it is, was more important than his life...
4 In fact I'd rather not try to influence you at all.  Let's just go in and take a look, and then you think it through for yourself.

1 Why can't you look at him?	I have but well, you know, I've been mainly an anesthetist a long time now and... well, I'd like you guys to take a look at him.
2 What's the story?	Well, one of the girls got careless and two days ago she gave birth to an eight-pound American-Japanese male.
3 What's wrong with him?	Every time we feed him, it either comes right back up or he coughs and turns blue and has a hell of a time.

1 Morning Painless. How they goin'?	Big day. Two jaws to rebuild.

1 We'll find out what they are when you throw us out.	That's all the commitment you're offering me?  Or do you have some more extravagant gesture of cooperation?

1 What's wrong with you?	I don't know. I must have lost my punch. I didn't think the son-of-a- bitch would get up.

1 Those two big guys were tackles on the Cleveland Browns, and the redhead played halfback with the Rams.	They can't do that to me!

1 We don't have to see him. Call that halfassed Army hospital and tell them to be ready to put some lipiodol in this kid's esophagus and take X- rays.	But it's ten-thirty at night. We can't get military personnel out for a civilian. A foreign civilian.

1 Here. Sit down!  Quiet, egghead!  All right, now, a serious expression.	Can't. I'm feeling too good.
2 Oh, come on, now. This is serious. You're a man disgusted with all of civilization.	With all of it?
3 Yes, you're sore at the world. Come on, now.	Oh, crabby guy, huh?

1 Well, would you like to know who it was you were marrying?	Well, a tall handsome Ubangi, I suppose.
2 No, not that bad. It was a fella that sends you flowers every day. Er, what's his name? Mr. Norton's nephew.

1 Oh, somebody else sitting there?	No, no, nothat's your seat.

1 That's your father's diary, Ann.	Father's . . . I never knew he had a diary.
2 There's enough in it for a hundred speeches, things people ought to hear nowadays. You be careful of it, won't you dear?  It's always helped keep your father alive for me.	You bet I will, Ma.

1 You're supposed to be a smart guy! If it was raining hundred dollar bills, you'd be out looking for a dime you lost some place.	Holy smokes! Wasting my time listening to this mad woman.

1 Well, okay. But we don't want more than a couple o' hundred people in on this thing. Now the first thing I want is an exact copy of the John Doe letter in your own handwriting.	I got it all ready. Here.
2 Well, that's fine. Now I want you to sign this agreement. It gives us an exclusive story under your name day by day from now until Christmas. On December twenty-sixth, you get one railroad ticket out of town, and the Bulletin agrees to pay to have your arm fixed. That's what you want, isn't it?

1 Colonel!	You shouldn't have gotten out of bed, Miss.
2 Has he been here?	No.
3 Have you seen him?	I ain't seen him for a week.
4 Where's Connell?	He's watching the other door.
5 Oh. Gee, you're swell! Oh.

1 Yeah, yeah, yeah.	Both of 'em?
2 Yes, both of 'em! But don't let him out of your sight.

1 Ba-ll!	I don't know how you're gonna stand it around here till after Christmas.

1 How could he be a fake? 	It must be some kind of a gag.
2 A what?	A gag. A gag!

1 Join the John Doe Club.	John Doe Club?

1 Don't write 'em? Why, that gold- grabbin' dame would double-cross her own mother for a handful of Chinese yen!	Shut up! If you weren't drunk I'd

1 How about family? Got any family?	No.
2 Oh, just traveling through, huh?	Yeah. Me and a friend of mine. He's outside.

1 Oh, yeah. That's what I mean. See? It was easy as all that, huh?	Uh-huh.
2 Yeah, yeah, but look, Mrs. Mitchell, you know I love Ann and it's gonna be awfully hard for me to say it because, well, you know, she's so wonderful, and, well, the best I ever was was a bush-league pitcher.

1 Hello, guys.	Hello, Roper. Glad you could join us.

1 What happened? Is there a problem?	May I come in? I would just like to ask you a couple of questions.

1 I... I'm Kevin. I 'm here to help you, D... Dave.	You can't help me, man.

1 The Old Guy? What kind of show of faith is that? I want Debbie.	Am I gettin' the car?
2 You're gettin' the car.

1 What do you got on Korda?	We ran a search on relatives. He has a cousin in town -- Clarence Teal. Smalltime thief. Last known address was on Pine Street. He moved out a month ago. We've got a couple leads on him to check out.
2 Did you check out DMV for any vehicles registration?	Being faxed over now.
3 How about the record room for any incident reports? He might be a victim. We can get medical records. Check with burglary detail and see if anyone else knows him, knows his habits.	Roper...
4 And what about bars? We can talk to neighbors to see what bars he frequents.	Roper, we're into it...

1 I'm impressed. I didn't think you could do it. What did you have to do, steal them?	Yeah.
2 That's not going to look too good on your service record.	I'll worry about that. Let's get on with it.

1 Eighty-five percent of domestic disturbances of this nature end in murder/suicide.	Not the ones I'm at.

1 I can't do that.	Then get out of my face you worthless piece of frogshit.

1 I bought you a four-six exacta box. You owe me twenty bucks.	I do.

1 See this. Solis has me driving the shit-mobile, and he picked this up straight out of impound for fourteen grand. Probably worth thirty.	Police corruption. It's everywhere.

1 Have you evacuated anyone?	Only that floor.
2 Is the hostage injured?	Don't know. She keeps screaming to stay out. He keeps screaming to stay out. We decided to stay out.
3 Well, there's a good amount of agreement on that.

1 Hey.	Hey yourself. Came by to see Troy.
2 A little late for that, Scottie. He's asleep.  Jack Daniels?	I'm not drunk. Yet.
3 Maybe you should be.	You heard.

1 What about Greg? What are you gonna tell him?	It's okay. We broke up.
2 When?	Just now.

1 Stay here, don't move.	Scottie...
2 Do it!

1 Tell him to give me a raise.	He says, "Thank you very much."  I'll discuss it with him right now... Good-bye, Chief.

1 There are two million people in there with you.	Yes.
2 They have nothing to do with this --	-- Two million people lost in the digital night.  What do they seek?

1 Do you believe in miracles?	I'm serious, how did you know my name?

1 Halden sent men to kill me in my sleep, but simple illusions won out.  So he now sends the legend to finish the deed.	No.
2 Then what?

1 Remember, I'm not the one who chose this.	Yes, so which one of us does that make the coward?

1 He had keys.	Of course the legend would like to think that.  But no one has keys.  Your maze was run.

1 Because why the hell would you be interested in a program that allows people to live inside your machines?  I mean how much profit could there possibly be from owning the universe and selling space in it to people who are dying, or people who are just God-Damned sick of this world --	-- Come on, you know F.C.O. regs. Anyone caught with their R and D hand in the bio-digitization cookie jar spends the rest of their life in federal penitentiary.  It's not worth it.

1 We drugged her.  So she wouldn't remember.	Try harder.
2 There was no need to kill her.	Then where is she?
3 Come on Tanner, think this through.

1 Identical.  One's you.  One's digital.	That's not possible.  No one can do that.
2 Corporation can.

1 Don't know what you're talking about.	Of course you do.  And the only shot you've got of keeping your ass from sinking in a sea of shit is to tell me where you got this program.

1 Connect to public access.	Access established.
2 Select uplink for Federal Communications Office.  Department of Enforcement.	Uplink selected.

1 So how can we get to it?	The only way to obtain the power is to achieve the highest state of being...

1 SYSTEM MALFUNCTION!	OUR SEMI-CONDUCTORS ARE DOWN!

1 By bouncing ultra-high frequencies off one of the network satellites, I can send a long-range pulsar signal to within TWO FEET of the Rangers coordinates.	... I just pray we're not too late.

1 All systems go!	This guy is messing with the wrong teenagers!

1 IMPACT IN FIFTEEN SECONDS!	WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE!!

1 And how do we do that?	By learning the ancient art of Ninjetti.  It is the Genesis of what you on earth have come to know as the Ninja.  It is the perfect union of mind, body and spirit.

1 No offense, boss, but they might find you a little disgusting.	Yes, well, I suppose you'd know a little something about that.  Not to worry.  I'll ever so gently lure them in and mold them into an army of devils!  And what better way to entice them ... than with a little Ivan's Ooze?!

1 Don't you ever have anything nice to say?!	Well, if I did I certainly wouldn't say it to you!

1 NINJA APE ZORD!	NINJA FALCON ZORD!

1 We have a commission. If there's a dispute over territory, the commission decides.	Tell me something, Meyer. How can you get up at dawn to walk on the beach if you're on your honeymoon?
2 The commission don't decide how I spend my honeymoon.	Hey, I ignore my wife too. But on our honeymoon I paid attention.
3 Boo-Boo.	Not another word.

1 Their asses are here, but their fuckin' heads are still in Sicily.	Precisely. We are the true entrepreneurs, and Prohibition is the greatest opportunity we shall ever have. America is begging to be taken like an overripe virgin, but they're still fighting over the crumbs of Little Italy.
2 We'll start small. When we got 'em lined up, we increase the supply a bit at a time. Only sell the best stuff. And keep the price high, 'cause ya know how folks hate the taste of cheap booze.	An intelligent plan, Mr. Luciano, but listen to me well. It can be ruined in a single careless moment. Keep your feet on the ground and your high opinion of yourself under your hat.
3 Don't worry. I got friends to take care of that.

1 Mad Dog Coll's in town on a job.	Who hired the bastard?
2 Maranzano. Ta ice you.

1 Inside, they were talking of you.	I can just imagine.
2 No. They envy you.	For being a bootlegger?
3 For being a man.

1 Would it be painful for you?	It always is.

1 At least Masseria plays by the rules. Maranzano thinks he's God, and the rules don't apply.	Without us, Masseria don't stand a chance, and he knows it.

1 Yeah. So who the fuck does?	Come on. Tell us, Shitface.

1 This business is about taking risks.	Calculated risks. But Boss, this one don't calculate.

1 When ya got all that blood workin' in your belly, it ain't upstairs where it needs to be.	The kid just called me stupid.
2 Not stupid. Fat.	Shit. When I was comin' up, bein' fat meant ya had somethin' ta eat. Guy looked like you, people felt sorry for 'em. Right, Gerardo?

1 We combine everything. You are my second in command.	What about the share.
2 You get fifteen percent.	I got partners.
3 Your Calabrian friend, I will accept. At least Costello eats pasta like us.	And the Jews?
4 Share with them as you wish. Do business with them on your own. But no filthy Jew will ever be a brother to me.

1 And if I had known, I would have warned you to expect this. We could have prepared.	Masseria's been after me too.
2 Thank you for keeping me informed.	We were overdue to get hit.
3 You think this is a coincidence? Next week half your customers will be buying their Scotch, our Scotch, from Maranzano. In a month, he'll be in Scotland talking to my distillers, because you can't move product. I'll be out of business, and you'll be working for Maranzano.	We can operate around these guys.
4 Not by scurrying around like a puppies in a roomful of elephants.	Okay. I'm listening.
5 A hundred years ago Austria was run by a prince named Metternich. Austria was weak, and it's neighbors were strong. But they were ruled by passionate men, while Metternich was ruthless and brilliant. If one country got too strong, he rallied an alliance against it. He would lead all of Europe to the brink of war, then bring the enemies together and forge the peace.

1 So we're gonna knock 'em both off?	If it comes to that. Yeah.

1 Now don't pick a fight. I'm staying over.	Oh, poor Buster. He hasn't been fed in a day and a half. Let me get some food...

1 Yeah, I know - Picasso. <u>Guernica</u>, right? That's what everybody says - although personally, I don't see the resemblance. What are you drinking?	Uhh - martini?
2 Olive or eyeball?	Olive. - Where exactly am I?
3 Dark Town. Land of nightmares. I'm Bull.	Stu Miley.
4 Yeah, I've seen a few of your dreams. You're quite a celebrity down here.

1 At the moment, yes.	Can you give me a realistic idea...of how long this is going to last?
2 Comas are unpredictable. He could wake up today, tomorrow, a month from now...	Honey, I have to clarify this. The thing is, Dr. Edelstein, my brother has an absolute <u>horror</u> of doctors - hospitals - needles - all of it -

1 Holy shit.	He's stuck in a loop - a nightmare loop. <i></i> Anybody here know what Oneirix is?

1 Guys, I don't mean to be rude, but I only have eleven hours and fifty-three minutes to...	Oh, right. Cheating Death. There's <u>one thing</u> you might try. Only one guy in <u>history</u> ever pulled it off. Well, actually two. Actually, no, there was that other guy who...well, <u>very few people</u> have done it.
2 Hyp, I'll do anything.

1 Priceless! Priceless! This stuff just <u>kills</u> me!	I'm heading in to work, baby. Are you sure you'll be okay?
2 Oh yeah. There's just one thing I don't get. "Monkeybone Creator Awakens from Coma" that's a big story! That's front page news! But I can't find a <u>word</u> of coverage in this stinkin' rag! <i></i> Hey. Don't I have a TV show?	They only made the one episode. They've shown it about nineteen times.
3 I need a new PR guy.

1 I'm fine, baby. We're all okay. We were lucky.	I'd better go report this...

1 I'm so sorry, Stu. I <u>wanted</u> to tell you what was going on. I really, really liked you.	Kitty...<u>my</u> situation is really not important. The thing is, my girlfriend is now living with, and possibly engaged to, a demented monkey.
2 You're such a beautiful man. Look at you - stuck in this place, and only thinking of her.	Listen to me! Is there any way I can <u>warn</u> her what Monkeybone is up to??

1 He's ninety. He's practically dead already. How come <u>he</u> goes back and <u>I</u> stay here?	Maybe he wanted to pick out his own casket?
2 <i></i> HEY!! HEY, YOU!!

1 Where'd he go??	I don't <u>know</u>.

1 Well, when I walked up the block, I ... well, my word!	That's New York.  It looks rundown, but it's safe during the day.  You'll get used to it.

1 I love you, Mom.  I have to run.  You remembered to call the limousine service, right?	Mm hmm.
2 Well, bye.  And have a safe trip ... and ... Paris in the spring!	Goodbye, sweetheart.

1 Here you are, Senator. Not a bad desk, either. Daniel Webster used to use it.	Daniel Webster? Sat here? Say--that man was a great orator.
2 Give you something to shoot at, Senator--if you figure on doing any talking.	Not me, sonny. I'm just going to sit around and listen.  What's this?
3 Calendar for the day. You'll find the Senate Manual in the drawer. Anything else you want, just snap for a page.	Where's the Majority Leader?
4 The Majority Leader? Right over there. And that's [           ] the Minority Leader. They're both pretty good in the clinches.	Uh-huh. And where's the Press Galery?
5 Right up there over the Vice- President's chair--the four in the front row represent the four big news services. You've met the press bunch, haven't you?	Oh, yes--they're fine people--regular people.
6 Look out for those fellows--they tell the truth about you--sometimes. That corner over there is reserved for guides and sightseers who come in for five minutes to rest their feet. That section over there is reserved for Senator's friends. The front row--the empty one--is for the President and White House guests-- see that old couple over there-- they've attended every session for the last twenty years. Over the clock back here is the Diplomatic section. They and the page boys are the only real class we have in this place. The rest are mostly people who come here like they go to the zoo--	Those busts up there--all around the wall--who are they, sonny?
7 All the ex-vice-Presidents. You can get ten-to-one around here if you think you can remember their names. The Vice-President presides over the Senate--you know that. It's how he earns his pay. Oh--over there, Senator-- on the east side of the Chair we still have the old snuff boxes with real snuff in them if you like snuff.	Thanks very much, sonny--
8 I'll take your hat into the cloak room.	Here--let me give you a Boy Ranger button.
9 Swell. Thanks very much.  Good luck, Senator. Keep your left up.

1 Well--who d'you take this time--Paine, Bill, Carl--or McGann?	Hey--you're into me for a buck already. I say--McGann. Shoot the whole dollar.
2 Okay. For the dollar, I give you McGann *and* Bill and Carl. I got Paine.  Hello... Oh, yes.

1 The Silver Knight. Soul of Honor--on a tight-rope.	What do I play?
2 You play--left field.	Frankly, kid--are you goofy?
3 Diz--Don Quixote with bill is going to get to his feet in a minute and speak two important words--*Willet Creek*. When that happens--if my hunch is right--the Silver Knight will fall off his tightrope and Puss will jump out of his boots.

1 Diz!	Kid--he thinks he's talking to that mob at home, but not a line we've written--not a word he's said from that floor has gotten into that home State.
2 What!	Not a word! Taylor's sewed up every paper. They're tossing out everything that comes in over the wires!
3 Freedom of the press! Mr. James Taylor blindfolding a whole State--  Wait a minute! If that's how he wants to play *I'll* get through to that bunch--I'll get plenty of words into that, State--!  Come on, Diz, get that stuff you've written--let me have it--

1 Yes, yes--tell them I'll see them immediately--immediately!  I can't hold them off! They want something to say about this appointment. Ten to one they've got a man.	Relax, Happy. Jim said to wait.
2 I *can't* wait, McGann! You go into that room and tell Jim Taylor and Joe Paine that I give them *one more minute*--	*You* tell Jim Taylor.
3 Washington! Always discussing the problems of Washington. Nobody ever thinks of the State--and my problems!  I *will* tell Jim Taylor. It's high *time* I told him a thing or two! 

1 But you went ahead and made this appointment without asking me--	Jim--when the lightning hit, I--I just--
2 *But you never asked me*!	Oh--Jim!

1 He's the greatest *American* we got, too, Dad. Can tell what George Washington said--by heart. An' "Boy Stuff's" got the swellest stuff in it.	What stuff?

1 When Jeff gets through with Taylor, Pop--	When Jeff gets through with Taylor--  Quiet! What do you mean by breaking in here--? Get out! Get *out* of here!

1 Will the Senator yield for a question?	I yield.
2 In view of the gentleman's touching concern for the Senators, would he permit a motion to recess until the morning--at which time he could continue to educate this august body with his profound babblings?

1 Mr. President--	He has imputed to me conduct unworthy a Senator--and I demand he be made to yield the floor--!
2 Mr. President--I did not say that Senator Paine was one of those Congressmen I saw. If the chair please, I will deny that Senator Paine *saw* Taylor or even knows him--	I *did* see Taylor! And I was in that room!

1 Well. I hear you've been right on your toes since you got here. Pitching right in. Lots of people took you for dumb--but they're wrong. You're smart. In fact, *I* think you're smart enough to understand a situation when it's explained to you--	Like what, Mr. Taylor?
2 Well now--just to take an example-- putting up a dam--on Willet Creek. As I look at it--that dam's going to do the people of our state a lot of good--	Yes, so I was told, Mr. Taylor, but--
3 But you have some objections here and there. And maybe right, for all I know. But the point is--there's no sense stopping the whole works now-- specially after some men have worked hard for a long time to put this through--	What is your interest in this, Mr. Taylor?
4 Mine? Why--naturally--whatever benefits the state is mighty important to me--owning a lot of its industry-- newspapers and other odds and ends. And if I thought you had the welfare of the state at heart, like myself-- for instance, if you were to turn around and help a project like this along instead of standing in the way-- why, I'd say you were a man to watch. For a fellow your age, you'd be in a spot to make a great start in life. If you liked business--you could pick any job in the state and go right to the top. Or politics. If you like being a Senator. No reason why you couldn't come back to that Senate for the rest of your life.

1 No, gee--I couldn't stay here--	You *couldn't*?
2 I mean--gosh--I wouldn't be comfortable in a--I--I haven't got clothes and things like that--and--I couldn't keep pigeons *there*--No--I-- I just--just wouldn't be--

1 Yes--right here. Just a second--  Miss Paine.	*Who*! Miss--! Is that--? Why didn't you--? Holy smoke;  H-hello... Yes, Miss Paine... How-- how are you, Miss Paine...? What?... Escort *you* Gee--I mean--*sure*-- *yes*! I'd be--. Reception for a *princess*! Gosh!... Thanks, Miss Paine. Yes. I--I'll be there! Goodbye, Miss Paine.  Did you hear that?--Escort Susan Paine--reception for a princess! Imagine her calling me--asking *me*-- !
2 Get your hat, Senator. We've got a lot to do between now and tomorrow--	Wow!

1 Ah! That's more like it! What?	Well--for a couple of years now--I-- I've thought it would be a wonderful thing to have a National Boys' Camp out in our State--
2 A camp! Well!	You see--if we could take the poor kids off the streets--out of cities-- a few months in the summer--learn something about Nature and American ideals--

1 The chair recognizes the rather strong- lunged junior Senator, Mr. Smith.	I--I'm sorry, sir. I--I have a bill--

1 Marvelous! And what would this camp set the Government back?	Oh--nothing--nothing. My idea is-- for the Government to lend us the money--and the boys'll pay it back-- sending in a penny or a nickel--no more than a dime--no, gosh--the Government's got enough on its hands without--
2 Great!  The Government's putting dough in too many places *now*!

1 Joe--drop everything and come with me!	What's the matter?

1 What do you want, Senator?	Saunders--it's going to go pretty bad for Jeff tomorrow. There's only one thing that can be done for him now--  I--I've written his resignation. He resigns under protest--denying all charges. No one will ever be sure if he was guilty or not. It leaves him with at least a shred of honor. The other way--branded openly in the Senate--expelled--he'll never live it down. Rather a simple compromise than utter ruin. In a year--the whole thing might be forgotten--
2 What are you driving at? You want *me* to get him to sign that?	Yes--
3 Why don't you do it yourself?	He's lost complete faith in me--
4 Well--me, too!	But--you love him, don't you, Saunders?
5 What are you talking about? What difference--?	Do you?
6 All right--*yes*! And what does that make me to him? *Nothing*! I've got to go about my own business--and forget it!	I thought I could, too.  *My* business--this fine future! I have no future I *care* about, if this boy is broken! I--I can't sleep. The only important thing in my life now is to save what I can for him. I want him to get a start again--I'll see that he's taken care of as long as he lives--!  Saunders--whether you ever mean anything to him or not--
7 *Me! Me*! I *still* don't see why I should--! If you love him so much, why don't you go to him yourself and-- ? Or better still--get up in that Senate and *fight* for him!	It's too late now--it's *impossible*!
8 So I go right back where I was-- carrying compromises--covering up-- back to political tricks--this time for--! No! I was just getting rid of all that. If I did *anything*, I ought to go and tell him to stand up and--. No! I don't want any part of it! Smith or anything else! I'm all through. I want to be left alone!

1 Jim--the boy's talking to that State-- the story is out--!	Sure! The fight's in the open now-- to a finish--!
2 And if he can raise public opinion against us--if any *part* of this sticks--	He won't get started! I'll *make* public opinion out there in five hours. I've done it all my life! I'll blacken this punk until--  Joe--your job is back in the Senate-- keep those men fighting him *there*.
3 I hit him from the floor with everything I knew!	Keep doing it! This is the whole works, Joe--we're out of business of bigger than we then we ever were. We can't miss a trick--we can't stop at *anything*--till this yokel's smashed up and buried so deep he'll never--!

1 I accuse this man--by his tone--by his careful denials--he is deliberately trying to plant damaging impressions of my conduct--! *I'll* tell you why we were in tht room. Because Mr. Taylor, a respected citizen of our State, had brought with him the evidence against this man, later presented from this floor, and *we were urging him to resign*-- !	Order!
2 --to avoid bringing disgrace upon a clean and honorable State!

1 We'd like to get in touch with him. It's very important.	Who's that?
2 Deeds! Who do you think I'm talking about?	Oh, yes - Deeds. Fine fellow. Very democratic. You won't have no trouble at all. Talk to anybody.

1 Oh, yes.	Yes, indeedy.

1 Your Honor, this is absurd. The woman's obviously in love with him.	What's that got to do with it?
2 Well, you are in love with him, aren't you?	What's that got to do with it?
3 You are , aren't you?	Yes!!!

1 I told 'em I'd play along with them if they lowered their prices - and cut down expenses - and broadcast.	What did they say?
2 Gosh, you look pretty tonight.	What did they say?
3 Huh?  Oh. They said I was crazy. Said I wanted to run it like a grocery store.	What are they going to do?
4 Do you always wear your hair like that?

1 I'd rather have Mandrake Falls.	I'm from a small town too, you know.
2 Really?	Probably as small as Mandrake Falls.
3 Gosh! What do you know about that!

1 Mary, I'm going home.	Are you? When?
2 In a day or so, I think.	I don't blame you.

1 What'll I tell him if he calls up?	Tell him I had to leave suddenly. I got a job in China - some place.
2 You're acting like a school girl.	What else can I do? Keeping this up is no good. He's bound to find out sometime.  At least I can save him that .

1 What're you going to do?	I'm going to tell him the truth.
2 Tell him you're Babe Bennett? Tell him you've been making a stooge out of him?	I'm having lunch with him today. He expects an answer. It's going to be pretty.
3 You're crazy! You can't do that!

1 We've got nothing to worry about. He's as naive as a child.	John
2 Close that door.  Will you get Mrs. Cedar on the phone, please?

1 How is this, sir?	Perfect! Perfect!
2 I wish you luck, sir.	Thank you. Now don't touch a thing. Leave everything as it is.

1 It's a lie!	Mr. Cedar!
2 Mr. Deeds is drawing on his warped imagination!

1 Well, your uncle was Chairman of the Board of Directors. They probably expect you to carry on.	I'll tell those mugs to keep their shirts on, that you'll be right down.

1 Will you have a cigar?	No, thank you.

1 Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington. Funny, I can't think of a rhyme for Budington.	Why should you?
2 Well, whenever I run across a funny name, I always like to poke around for a rhyme. Don't you?	Nah.
3 I've got one for Cobb	"There once was a man named Cobb, Who kept Semple away from the mob. Came the turn of the tide And Semple - he died - And now poor Cobb's out of a job!"
4 Sounds like a two weeks' notice to me.	Huh?
5 I've gotten the 'sackaroo' in many ways - but never in rhyme.	Oh, I don't mean that. I'm sure I'm going to need your help.
6 Oh, that's different if it's just poetry.

1 I don't remember. "Cinderella Man!" What do they mean by that?	They'd call you anything if you gave them half a chance. They've got you down as a sap.
2 I think I'll go down and punch this editor on the nose.	No, you don't! Get this clear: Socking people is no solution for anything.
3 Sometimes it's the only solution.	Not editors. Take my word for it. Not editors!
4 If they're going to poke fun at me, I'm going to	Listen. Listen, Longfellow. You've got brains, kid. You'll get along swell if you'll only curb your homicidal instincts - and keep your trap shut. Don't talk to anybody! These newshounds are out gunning for you.
5 But what about this "Cinderella Man"?	That's my job. I'll take care of that. I'll keep that stuff out of the papers - if you'll help me. But I can't do anything if you go around talking to people. Will you promise me to be careful from now on?
6 Yes, I guess I'll have to.	Thank you.  If you feel the building rock, it'll be me blasting into this editor.

1 That's impossible. The opera has never paid.	Well, then, we must give the wrong kind of shows.

1 Well, what about it, Mr. Deeds?	You'll excuse me, won't you? I'll be right back.

1 No.	You mean to tell me you don't carry a pocketful around with you?

1 Huh? On, no. Nobody important.	Be sure and point 'em out to me, won't you?
2 Uh-huh.	I'm a writer myself, you know.

1 No, he's too fussy for that. That's what's the matter with him. There are lots of nice girls right here in Mandrake Falls who're dying to be married	Don't pay any attention to her.
2 He's got a lot of foolish notions - about saving a lady in distress.	Now you keep out of this!

1 No, sir.	Excuse me. What did you say?

1 Hey, did you hear that?	What, sir?

1 I know my time's up, but I've got to get this out while I've got hold of it --	Take your time.
2 -- When I was in high school, the thing I wanted most, when I was stuck in class, the thing I was always desperately in pursuit of -- was a hall pass. That's all I wanted. I loved moving freely around the school while everybody else was trapped in there... And that's how I feel right now... Like I have some giant, all- day hall pass.

1 What Ernest means, I think, is we're very interested in other methodology... different kinds of training. We're great believers in learning from each other. I've learned so much from Ern -- Dr. Delbanco...	...And I from Phyllis.
2 So... the University of Kentucky. Who runs the program down there?

1 ...I won't go into that today. Though, if we should continue these sessions, as I certainly hope we will, there are some aspects of that I would like to look at. God knows, I've listened to enough people giving me the juicy --  ...At any rate, I just wanted to acknowledge the catalyzing effect your comment had on me. I just hope that it doesn't come roiling back upon you like some dreadful undertow.	How do you mean?

1 What is it?	It's a thought I had.
2 Should I open it now?

1 I think you'll like this. Know much about Cuban cigars?	Nope.

1 Meat loaf, turkey quesadillas, or salad nicoise.	Salad nicoise? I love salad nicoise.
2 You do?	Yeah.
3 Well, come on in.

1 Lily, I want you to meet Skip. Skip, Lily.	It's a pleasure to meet you.

1 Hello, Lionel.	You've got to have the right ladder for the job. You don't know what you're doing, you can get yourself in trouble.
2 You're right, as usual. See you.

1 What'd you want?	There's something I think we need to talk about.
2 What?

1 That's okay. Maybe it is. My mother always says -- "Everything that's wrong with you is in your head." I suppose that's true.	Back when this started, was there anything unusual happening in your life? A change of job, of living situation... a loss of some kind?
2 No... but it started one year to the day after my divorce became final. That's not too suspicious, is it?... But it wasn't like I was feeling bad about the divorce. Just the opposite.	Hmm.
3 Hmm? Is that a professional opinion?	Hmm, as in -- that's interesting. Sometimes, with enough clues, it's possible to figure these things out.
4 Even if you don't think it's real?	I don't know what's real and what isn't. That's never been my strong suit. But if you're tired all the time and you've had to give up the life you were having and come back home when you didn't want to... that's worth trying to fix. Maybe I can help you do that.
5 What would you do?	We... we would try several things. But I need to see you a lot.
6 I don't know. I barely made it today.	I'll come to you. We'll try a little walking.

1 Painful lymph glands?  Forget fulness... irritability... depression?	Yes, yes, and definitely yes. Also... I get confused.
2 Yeah, most people have that. It's confusing here.	Where?
3 Life.

1 -- you've been a tremendous help to me.	Yeah?
2 I can't tell you how much I admire you. You have a wonderful way with people. And you're very insightful. I feel like you've seen me clearly... I never used to admit what a horrible person my mother was. You've made that possible for me.	That's... good?
3 Yes! And my ex-husband -- he never accepted me for who I was, just like Mother. The things you've said have helped me understand what a dick he is.	I don't know if --
4 You're shockingly honest, that's what makes you great. I've never had a man treat me this way. With you, I feel really... listened to.  Can I tell you something? It's a little embarrassing, but I feel very unguarded with you.	Of course.
5 Thanks to this therapy, I now know what I'm looking for. I need to find a man like you.  Not one who's treating me, of course.  And I'm going to do it, dammit! You've given me the confidence.

1 I am irate!	But...
2 But nothing... I'm mad as hell. This is a terrible thing you've done.	I know it! Please believe me, I know that...

1 I don't think you know what you're talking about.	Uh-huh.
2 This shrink school you went to... did you hear about it on an infomercial?

1 I hope you don't think I want you to do this for free. Just because we're gonna play it like we're friends, doesn't mean I won't pay you like a doctor.	I understand.
2 I have a lot of money. Do you know how much money I've got?	Don't tell me, 'cause I'm not going to tell you what I've got.
3 I've got three big ones.	I'm impressed. I couldn't make three million dollars if I lived three lifetimes.
4 No, no... I have three billion dollars.

1 Yeah, well... what I was gonna tell you --	-- Skip. Knowing what you do about me --
2 Doc, I trust you! You've listened to me better than anybody... maybe ever.  And this secret I've got, I can't stand it anymore. I don't know if I'm some kind of --

1 -- an investigator for the Internal Revenue Service?	Everybody has a story, Skip.
2 Sounds like you have several.	What it felt like was... a series of separate, unconnected lives -- hillbilly kid, wrecked college boy, garbage man, civil service guy...  ...et cetera... et cetera. Every time I'd leave a life, it felt good. Whatever problems I was having were suddenly gone. I had no friends and I didn't talk to my family. The only constant, stabilizing force in my life was... drugs.
3 An IRS investigator with a drug problem?	It wasn't the best situation.
4 Did you carry a gun?	Didn't need one. We didn't even need a warrant for most of the shit we did. Man, the IRS... we could go in your bank account, your credit cards... hell, we used to go into doctors' files and get all the juicy details. Nobody wants to argue with the IRS.

1 I've never brought anyone down here before.	I'm honored.
2 Doc, there's something about what you told me the other night I can't get out of my head. It's driving me batty --  Why me? How did you know you could trust me?	You're completely reliable.

1 I trained in the east, myself -- Cornell -- and I don't care what anyone says, there really are regional differences. I found the state certification exams out here quite harrowing... Did you?	Oh, yeah, very tough. But I guess that's good... to keep out the quacks.
2 Which examiner did you have? I probably know him.	Wallace Franklin... from Greensburg.

1 Personally, I would like to surrender. Why can we not just surrender?	Shut-up and gimme your bandolier.

1 Ten to one, O'Connell, your odds are no-so-good.	I've had worse.

1 Yeah?	Oh yes, always.

1 The key!? She has the lost key!?	Yes. No one has ever had so much, been so close. We must stop her, or it will be the end of us all.
2 Then we will kill her, we will kill her and all those with her.	And burn the map and retrieve the key.
3 It will be done. But what of the American expedition? They leave tomorrow as well.	Forget the bumbling Americans, they will be like all the others. Without the map to guide them, how can they possibly find Hamunaptra?

1 The hell with this. I'm goin, downstairs to get me a drink. You want somethin'?	Yeah, get me a glass of bourbon, a shot of bourbon and a bourbon chaser.

1 We uh,... found... your puzzle box, and we've come to ask you about it.	No.
2 No?	No... You came to ask me about Hamunaptra.

1 Evil. The Tuaregs and the Bedouin believe that Hamunaptra is cursed, they call it, "the doorway to hell."	Ahmar is Ossirion. "Passageway to the underworld", actually.

1 Oh my god,... it looks like, it looks like a sarcophagus.	Why would they bury somebody in the ceiling?
2 They didn't, they buried him at the foot of Anubis. He was either someone of great importance. Or he did something very naughty.

1 Is he supposed to look like that?	No. I've never seen a mummy look like this. He's, he's still...

1 Got it!	Got what?

1 You told me you found it on a dig down in Thebes!	I was mistaken.
2 You lied to me!	I lie to everybody, what makes you so special?
3 I'm your sister.	That just makes you more gullible.
4 You stole it from a drunk at the local Casbah?!	Picked his pocket, actually.

1 What do I do, Evy!? What do I do!?	Read the inscription on the cover!

1 None taken.	We'll sneak up and steal that book right out from under them.
2 And you're sure you can find the secret compartment?

1 Damn-it! That's two down and only two to go.	And then he'll be coming after Evy.

1 Where are you going?	Head hunting.

1 Much less go outside.	Then Captain Amazing appeared.

1 It's late. I'm headin' home.	Me, too.
2 Come on, Junior, it's a school night.

1 Yes!	Doctor Heller?
2 Yes!	It's me... Elizabeth.
3 Elizabeth! Little Elizabeth! Why you're so... middle aged!	Thanks.
4 How's your dad?	He's dead.
5 Oh that's right -- they squished him... Heck of a guy.

1 Thanks for reminding me which team I'm on.	You're dead.
2 So are you!

1 I'd better go.	You're a spy.
2 What?	I saw him walk you home.
3 Who?	Roy.

1 You know what? Underneath all that anger I think there's just a little boy who wants everyone to love him.	I just want to be a superhero.
2 That's what I mean... 'Night, Roy.

1 But now Casanova's back! And we're gonna sit around here all night eating pizza and telling stories! Hey, lets toast some marshmellows!	The wise snake coils before he strikes.
2 And a skunk stinks!

1 Have you ever seen him?	How could I see him if he's invisible?
2 Good point.

1 Cover me!	With what?

1 I'm soaked.  Oh great.	Shhh.

1 He's turned into a completely normal person!	Normal. What's normal? Does normal exist? And if it did, how would we know it?

1 Here you go. 	Ow.
2 Maybe you guys ought to forget this Superhero stuff and join Kiwanis or something.

1 Don't crunch the leaves.	Sorry.
2 Be a Mohican. 

1 Maybe it's time we checked that place out.	But how do we get in?

1 Well, that is a very interesting idea, General Kutusov, but I can assure you that Napoleon is no beginner at this.  Whatever analysis you have done on this situation, I am sure that he has gone over the same ground.	I have no doubt that he has, Your Majesty, but does he have any strong moves from which to choose?
2 Well, one thing immediately comes to mind, if what you are saying is true -- he would merely withdraw his army from Moscow and return to Poland for the winter.	Your Majesty has grasped the outlines of his problem in much less time than it took me.  This is a crucial point -- and it is a political one, which Your Majesty will be in a far better position to answer than I.  Can Napoleon afford to abandon Moscow without signing even the preliminaries of a peace treaty with you?
3 I must confess he would look a bit silly, fighting his way to Moscow and turning right around again.	Perhaps it would be even more serious than that, Your Majesty. His European confederation is held together by some very slender threads.  Your Majesty knows even better than I that Austria and Prussia are very doubtful allies, and the Emperor has reason enough to fear that they will turn on him, at the first sign of weakness.
4 Proceed.	If I can presume to go into the Emperor's mind, I believe that he has based his entire campaign strategy on obtaining a peace treaty after the fall of Moscow.  When Vienna fell, there was a peace treaty.  When Berlin fell, another treaty.  That has always been the rules of the game.  But what is he to do now if no treaty is forth- coming?  He knows that beyond Moscow, there is nothing, and that, if he withdraws, there remains only a fall into emptiness.

1 But, sire, Your Majesty would lay Paris open to being sacked.  The enemy is outside the gates with more than 120,000 men.  Besides this, I left the city under the terms of a treaty and I am forbidden to reenter Paris.	A treaty?  Don't be ridiculous. What treaty is this?  Who made it? Who has been giving orders?
2 I don't know the details of the treaty, sire, Marshal Mortier sent me word of its having been agreed to, and he said that I was to take the army and make for Fontainebleau.	But who made this treaty?
3 I believe it was arranged by Marshals Mortier and Marmont.  I must explain to you that we have had no orders all day.  Each marshal has been keeping his own position.	Who sent my wife and son out of Paris?
4 I don't know, sire.	And where is Joseph?
5 I don't know what has happened to Prince Joseph.	What cowardice!  What treason! Joseph has ruined everything.  How could they all lose their heads. They knew I was coming up fast. Victory was just within grasp. Come, come, turn your troops around, General Belliard.

1 Then, you have my thanks, Captain Charles, for safely escorting Madame Bonaparte to Milan, and you may consider your assignment completed.	Thank you, sir.
2 You will return to Paris tomorrow and you will carry my compliments and thanks to General Le Clerc for assigning such an excellent officer to carry out a responsibility which has meant so much to myself and to Madame Bonaparte.	Thank you, sir.  I will do that.
3 You may go, Captain Charles.

1 Ah, my dear Francis, what a genuine pleasure it is to meet you at last.	I fear our meeting is long overdue... Napoleon.
2 I'm sorry that I am unable to offer you better hospitality, but this is the only place I have inhabited for the past month.	You have made such excellent use of it; I should think you will hate to leave it.
3 Shall we move closer to the fire?	Yes -- an excellent idea.

1 I would like both of you to read this.  Please read it aloud.	To Citizen General Bonaparte from one who does not wish to see him dishonored by his wife.  You should know, Citizen General, that your wife has taken a lover, one Captain Hippolyte Charles... undated and unsigned.

1 Were you in love with him?	I thought I was.  I was confused.
2 And now?	Now, I know that I shall die if you leave me.
3 Do you expect me to believe that?	Yes.

1 God damn it, Junot, wouldn't you think I have enough things on my mind not to waste time on a letter like this to Joseph?	There's probably some explanation.
2 Yes, I'm sure he's been too busy chasing his whores to be bothered about my wife.

1 Good day, monsieur.  Do you think it is possible for you to tell your driver to stop ringing that bell?	My regrets, my dear Major, but I believe you have been blocking the road.
2 Are you trying to provoke me, monsieur?	No, Major, I merely wish to state that your vehicle appears to be somewhat slower and heavier than mine, and point out that, if you would be kind enough to pull over to one side of the road, I could pass you and be on my way.
3 May I inform you, monsieur, that I am Major Fidon, official courier to the court of the Emperor Napoleon, on my way to our Embassy at St. Petersburg and, in accordance with the rules of the road, no one may overtake or pass me.	Before you quote the rules of the road to me, Major, may I point out to you that you are not in France now, but that you are a guest in Russia.
4 If I have given you any cause to be insulted, monsieur, may I offer you immediate satisfaction?	If you wish to put things on that basis, then I will say good day to you, monsieur.

1 Citizen Lieutenant, my advice is to leave this town at once with your men.  We do not wish to do harm to our brothers in uniform.	Monsieur Varlac, do not pretend to speak for these good people whom you have misled and inflamed with violent speech.  Now, I order you to come down from the cart.

1 On December 2, 1804, Napoleon was made Emperor of France.  He would later say:  "I found the crown lying in the gutter and I picked it up."	Duroc, I have a bill here for 600,000 francs from Tirot, for building the Imperial throne and six decorated arm-chairs.  The amount is absurd -- and, at least twice too much.

1 That's okay, Unc.  I can't swim, either.	Good.

1 Where's that boy that told me Day-Day was here?	I don't know... I think he went out the back.
2 Can I look for myself?

1 It's about to work, just come on.	What about the dog?

1 Go on and make yourself at home.  I'mma go get dressed for work.	Oh, yeah, where you work at?
2 Pinky's Records and Disc in the shopping center.  I'mma talk to my boss and see if he got a little position for you.  'Cause you been unemployed for a long time now, Craig.	Thanks for reminding me.

1 It says we owe $3,900...by tomorrow.	Damn...how much money ya'll got left from the lottery?

1 This vacuum don't work.  Where's the restroom?	Out the door and to the left.

1 Wait.	Wait for what?

1 I did.  Is that door locked?	It's locked.
2 Make sure.

1 What's the matter?	I fell in some mud.  Now hurry up!

1 Nigga, you got knock the fuck out.	Yeah, pops!

1 Look, Roach, I know you ain't never worked in a record shop before and you're a little excited.  But if Pinky catches you doing that X-Games shit off his counter top, we both getting fired.  You feel me?	I feel you.  I've just been practicing that one move all week.  I thought that was it.

1 Roach, what are you doing?	R-U-S-H Intensely.

1 Hey.	Ya'll live around here?

1 What the fuck you looking at?	Nothing.

1 William.	Yeah, I got a urgent message for a customer named William Jones.  Drop everything, Craig is in trouble.  Come quick.  Don't try to call.

1 What about that ugly dog?	I got my mase.

1 Lousy. And I have siesta hair. I'm thinking of canceling the speech.	It's an important speech.

1 Look...I've... I've got a problem. A big problem...	Oh, yeah?

1 This? I've never even fired one.	Indeed.

1 Yes, yes, I understand.	Good.

1 You killed him.	That's right, I killed him. He fucked up one too many times so I put a bullet in his eye. Then I put two more into him just to make sure. Now that was somebody I loved.

1 My wife always said I had a problem trusting people.	Well, you can trust Eleanor Samara Grant.
2 You don't understand. I'm going to trust you. And you have to trust me.

1 Haven't you ever seen anybody kiss like that?	On TV.
2 You never saw your Mom and me kiss like that?

1 What do you do, if I may be so bold?	I'm just an accountant.
2 Don't denigrate yourself, my friend. Where would the government be without accountants?  They wouldn't know how hard they can squeeze us before we pop, isn't that right?

1 Why don't you tell me about the early years some other time?	I'm sorry. You understand I don't mind dying if I could save my daughter. I mean that.
2 Yeah, now listen.  I can't mess with these shoes any more or it's gonna look funny. You go down get yourself something to drink. Make sure Godzilla there, follows you.	What are you going to do?

1 Hey!	I think this is worth a dollar.

1 Where are we going?	Not very far, honey-pie. Not far at all.

1 I'm looking for them.	Where?
2 Right there.

1 Any trouble?	No.
2 He was a cool one, that Harper. Never broke.	He carried on some; kicked.

1 She don't put in at Cresap's Landing no more, but she still blows as she passes. Come on in and have a cup of coffee.	Ain't nobody stole Dad's skiff.
2 Ain't nobody goin' to neither, long as Uncle Birdie's around.

1 Here's what you owe me.  One, two, three, four, five... where's the other basket? Where's Ruby?	She went.
2 John: you go fetch Ruby.  Big Ruby's my problem girl. She can't gather eggs without bustin' 'em; but Ruby's got mother hands with a youngin, so what're you to say?

1 What's wrong, Mother?	Sshhh! He's in there.

1 Willa Harper there is certain plain facts of life that adds up just like two plus two makes four and one of them is this: No woman is good enough to raise growin' youngsters alone! The Lord meant that job for two!	Icey, I don't want a husband.
2 Fiddlesticks!

1 Ain't no sense in it, neither. I figured somethin' like this was brewin' when she went to bed last night.	How?
2 She tarried around the kitchen after I'd gone up, and when I went downstairs to see what was wrong...	What!
3 She'd found this fruit jar of dandelion wine  that the husband -- Harper -- had hid somewheres in the cellar.  She was drinking.

1 You swore, Pearl!	John! Don't!
2 You promised Dad you wouldn't never tell!

1 Get in the skiff, Pearl, goodness, goodness, hurry!	That's Daddy!

1 Why, he told me what fine little lambs you and your sister both was.	Is that all?

1 Now where, boy? Mind; no tricks. I can't abide liars.	Yonder.

1 I'm hungry.	Why, sure. And there's fried chicken and candied sweets and cornsticks and apple cobbler!
2 Can I have my supper please?	Naturally.
3 Can I have milk too?	Yes. But first of all we'll have a little talk.

1 That's mighty brave of you, Reverend.	I reckon it's been ordained this way, Brother Spoon.
2 Didn't -- didn't she leave no word?	A scrawl. On a piece of notepaper on the bureau.

1 Mornin', ladies.	How'do.

1 This gentleman warn't like them! He just give me a sody and the book.	Now who was this?
2 He never asked me for nothin'.	He must have wanted somethin', Ruby. A man don't waste time on a girl unless he gets something.

1 How can you tell?	R.E.M.'s. Rapid eye movements. The eyes follow the dream -- their movement picks up on this --

1 M'god, I look twenty years old.  You have any weird dreams last night?	Slept like a rock.
2 Well at least I have an objective wall to bounce this off.  You believe it's possible to dream about what's going to happen?	No.
3 You believe in the Boogey Man?	One two, Freddie's coming for you? No. Rod killed Tina. He's a fruitcake and you know it.
4 You believe in anything?	I believe in you, me, and Rock and Roll. And I'm not too sure about you lately.

1 Much better.	I heard your ma went ape at the security store today. You look like the Prisoner of Zenda or something. How long's it been since you slept?
2 Coming up on the seventh day. It's okay, I checked Guiness. The record's eleven, and I'll beat that if I have to.  Listen, I... I know who he is.	Who?
3 The killer.	You do?
4 Yeah, and if he gets me, I'm pretty sure you're next.

1 Hello Nancy.	Hi daddy. I know what happened.
2 Then you know more than I do -- I haven't even been upstairs.	You know he's dead though, right?

1 Who? Who did that?	Krueger.
2 Krueger?

1 No television, forget the homework, no phone calls.	No, Mother. Yes, Mother. No, Mother.
2 And no school tomorrow, either. You take a little vacation, relax and rest for a change.	Yes, Mother. G'night.

1 Your father the cop. That's a good one.  Forget Fred Krueger. You don't want to know, believe me.	I do want to know. He's not dead and gone -- he's after me and if I sleep he'll get me! I've got to know!

1 Someone else was there.	The door was locked from your side.

1 Maybe we should call Rod, have him come over too. He might get jealous.	Rod and I are done. He's too much of a maniac.

1 They didn't let me. I am in disgrace. Last week at the performance of Carmen I played a sour note. The conductor got so excited he yelled, "There's sabotage in the string section!"	Too bad... you missed an inspiring day, Anna.
2 I know... my heart is sad... but my feet are happy. When all the tanks and guns were roaring over the Red Square I sat here all by myself and played a Beethoven sonata. Not bad at all.  Are you expecting someone?	A few friends... just a little dinner party.
3 What are you serving?	An omelet.
4 An omelet! Aren't you living a little above your ration?	Well, I've saved up two eggs and each of my friends is bringing his own so we'll manage.
5 It just goes to prove the theory of our State. If you stand alone it means a boiled egg but if you're true to the collective spirit and stick together you've got an omelet.  That reminds me... have you heard the latest they're telling about the Kremlin?

1 That's her.	Imagine! The niece of the Czar opening the door for us.
2 Once in Petersburg I was driving down the Nevsky Prospect in my cart and Her Highness in her troika swept down from the opposite direction, and when I couldn't make way quick enough she spat in my face.

1 ...it may step out of a bazaar... it may wait for you in a corridor... it may hide in the shadow of a minaret....	Right now it's on the balcony.

1 Yes! We could stay with Leon!	Leon, how would you like to have three lifelong friends?

1 This is the apartment we have reserved for you, Comrade Yakushova. I hope you like it.	Which part of the room is mine?

1 Is it possible to bring you back to reality for a moment? I must have a complete report of your negotiations and a detailed expense account.	Don't ask for it, Ninotchka. There is a Turkish proverb which says, "If something smells bad, why put your nose in it?"
2 And there is a Russian saying: "The cat who has cream on his whiskers had better find good excuses."	With our cream situation what it is, it is Russia which should apologize to the cats.
3 Friends... friends, Buljanoff, Iranoff...

1 Nonsense. How can you fight the Reds and make yourself agreeable to the Whites if you don't keep up your strength.	Shall I draw your bath, sir?

1 Only one in the rear, I'm afraid.	That's perfect!

1 Leon, my little boy.	Oh, Leon, you are so good.

1 There's something in Constantinople... something irresistible....	...it is in the air... it may come around the corner as you walk down the street....

1 Comrade Buljanoff...	Comrade.
2 Comrade Kopalski...	Comrade.
3 What a charming idea for Moscow to surprise us with a lady comrade.

1 I might be able to accommodate you. Is there some more luggage?	Oh, yes, but have you a safe here big enough to hold this?
2 I'm afraid we have no boxes of that size in our vault, but there is one suite with a private safe...	That's even better.
3 But, gentlemen, I am afraid...

1 What's that?	It's a hat, Comrade, a woman's hat.

1 ...and Kopalski.	Don't make it difficult for me. This is no more a pleasure trip for me than it is for you.

1 The foundation is one hundred and forty-one yards square...  I hope you'll forgive me but I thought you'd...	Go ahead.

1 Thank you.	Oh, my barbaric Ninotchka. My impossible, unromantic, statistical...

1 I'll tell you that joke again. A man comes into a restaurant. Did you get that?	Yes.
2 He sits down at the table and says to the waiter... Did you get that too?	Yes.
3 Well, so far it isn't funny, but wait. He says to the waiter, "Waiter! Bring me a cup of coffee." So the waiter comes back five minutes later and says, "I'm sorry, sir, we have no coffee."...  Wait a minute... wait a minute... I'm all mixed up...  A man comes in a restaurant, he sits down, he calls the waiter and he says, "Waiter! Get me a cup of coffee without cream," and five minutes later the waiter comes back and says, "I'm sorry, sir, we have no cream, can it be a glass of milk!"

1 From what I read I thought champagne was a strong drink. It's very delicate. Do people ever get drunk on this?	There have been cases... but the headache the next morning is worth while -- if you drink it with the right toast.  To us, Ninotchka!

1 I am so happy. No one can be so happy without being punished. I will be punished and I should be punished.  I want to confess, darling.	I know... it's the Russian soul.
2 Everyone wants to confess and if they don't confess they make them confess. I am a traitor. When I kissed you I betrayed the Russian ideal. Leon, I should be stood up against the wall.

1 They wouldn't let me in so I had to get you out.	So -- you're behind all this. I should have known.

1 What did he say?	It looks pretty hopeless... there may be a chance... that's all... The French Government has recognized Soviet Russia and he doubts that they will risk a war for my poor sake. He might be able to make up some kind of a case but it would cost money, money, money!... That's all they are interested in -- those lawyers!
2 Darling, calm down. Why do you need a lawyer? Haven't you your little Volga boatman?

1 Hello, Leon darling!	Hello.
2 After our talk last night I took it for granted that you would drop in here this morning. Knowing how difficult it is to get into Soviet Russia, I thought I might be of some assistance to you.  May I introduce myself? I am the Duchess Swana of Russia... another Russia.

1 I wouldn't waken Leon. After last night I would say not before three o'clock at the earliest.	I told you to go, madame.
2 Believe me, Leon can't help you. He doesn't know anything about the jewels... I give you my word... I swear it.

1 Bring me something simple. I never think about food.	But, madame! If you don't think about food what do you think about?
2 The future of the common people.	That also is a question of food, madame. I'll bring you a nice little lunch  la Pre Mathieu. 

1 How's the job coming, Bob?	Frankly, sir, it stinks.  I have no access.  I'm lucky Helms lets me have a staff.
2 We'll see about that ...	He's nervous, sir.  He's heard you're looking for a new director.
3 Well, he certainly isn't acting like it.	That's Helms.  He's "sang froid," a world-class poker player.
4 Yeah?  Well, I own the fucking casino.

1 I'm not going to be the scapegoat for this.  Haldeman and Ehrlichman are in just as deep as me.	John, you don't want to start down that road.  I remember what Whittaker Chambers told me back in '48 -- and he was a man who suffered greatly -- he said, "On the road of the informer, it's always night."  This is beyond you or even me.  It's the country, John.  It's the presidency.
2 I understand that, sir.	Good.  You know how I feel about loyalty.  I'm not going to let any of my people go to jail.  That I promise you.  The important thing is to keep this away from Haldeman and Ehrlichman. I'm trusting you to do that, John.  I have complete confidence in you.

1 Martha's an idiot, she'll do anything to get John's attention.  If Mitchell'd been minding the store instead of that nut Martha we wouldn't have that kid Magruder runnin' some third-rate burglary!  Was he smoking pot?	Mitchell?
2 No!  Magruder!  That sonofabitch tests my Quaker patience to the breaking point.

1 We can't touch Hoover --	I thought the gloves were off.
2 -- as long as he's got secret files on everybody.  I don't want 'em used against us.  What about the CIA?  Helms's done nothing for us.  I want to see him.

1 I don't know, I don't know ... I just know we've made too many enemies.	Sir, Bob and I are gonna have to testify before Earvin's committee.
2 No, you're not!  You're going to claim executive privilege and you're going to stonewall it all the way -- plead the Fifth Amendment.  I don't give a shit.  They can't force the President's people to testify.	Executive privilege will make it look like we're covering up.
3 We are covering up!  For some petty, stupid shit.  There are things I can say -- when other people say them, they'd be lies. But when I say them nobody believes me anyway ...

1 Who?	Cox!  Fire him.
2 But he works for the Attorney General. Only Richardson can fire him.

1 But O'Brien doesn't even use that office.  The Democrats've moved to Miami.  There's nothing there!	It was just a fishing expedition. Apparently it was their fourth attempt at the DNC.
2 Their fourth!	It's possible they were looking for evidence of an illegal Howard Hughes donation to the Democrats, so the Democrats couldn't make an issue of your Hughes money.
3 Contributions!  It was a legal contribution.  Who the hell authorized this?  Colson?

1 We've got to turn off the FBI.  You just go to the CIA, Bob, and tell Helms that Howard Hunt is blackmailing the President.  Tell him that Hunt and his Cuban friends know too damn much, and if he goes public, it would be a fiasco for the CIA.  He'll know what I'm talking about.	All right.
2 Play it tough.  That's the way they play it and that's the way we're going to play it.  Don't lie to Helms and say there's no involvement, but just say this is sort of a comedy of errors, bizarre, without getting into it.  Say the President believes it's going to open up the whole Bay of Pigs thing again.  Tell Helms he should call the FBI, call Pat Gray, and say that we wish for the sake of the country -- don't go any further into this hanky-panky, period!	The Bay of Pigs? ... That was Kennedy's screw-up.  How does that threaten us?
3 Just do what I say, Bob.	Yes, sir, but ... do you think Gray'll go for it?
4 Pat Gray'll do anything we ask him. That's why I appointed him.	He'll need a pretext.  He'll never figure one out for himself.
5 Christ, you're right -- Gray makes Jerry Ford look like Mozart.  Just have Helms call him.  Helms can scare anybody.	The only problem with that, sir -- it gets us into obstruction of justice.
6 It's got nothing to do with justice. It's national security.	How is this national security?
7 Because the President says it is.  My job is to protect this country from its enemies, and its enemies are inside the walls.

1 Alright.  But why, if Kennedy is so clean in all this, didn't he cancel Track 2?	Because he didn't even know about it. The CIA never told him, they just kept it going.  It was like ... it had a life of its own.  Like ... a kind of "beast" that doesn't even know it exists.  It just eats people when it doesn't need 'em anymore.  Two days after the Bay of Pigs, Kennedy called me in.  He reamed my ass ...

1 She got it, Bob.  A nineteen-year-old college kid ...	What?
2 She understood something it's taken me twenty-five fucking years in politics to understand.  The CIA, the Mafia, the Wall Street bastards ...	Sir?
3 ... "The Beast."  A nineteen-year-old kid.  She understands the nature of "the Beast."  She called it a wild animal.

1 We've got to turn the faucet off on this thing.  It's out of control ...  You might burden just me with this in the future.	It's Helms -- it's got to be.
2 We could leverage Helms.	How?
3 When I met with him, he said ...

1 We haven't said grace yet.  Richard.	Is it my turn?

1 I suppose, "Mister President," you're unhappy that we have not implemented your Domestic Intelligence plan, but ...	You're correct.  I'm concerned these students are being funded by foreign interests, whether they know it or not.  The FBI is worthless in this area.  I want your full concentration on this matter ...
2 Of course we've tried, but so far we've come up with nothing that ...	Then find something.  And I want these leaks stopped.  Jack fucking Anderson, the New York Times, the State Department -- I want to know who's talking to them.
3 I'm sure you realize this is a very tricky area, Mr. President, given our charter and the congressional oversight committees ...	Screw congressional oversight.  I know damn well, going back to the '50's, this agency reports what it wants, and buries what it doesn't want Congress to know.  Pay close attention to this.

1 I want to see him tomorrow, Clyde.	Edgar, think twice.  He works in the kitchen.
2 Not Joaquin, you idiot.  Nixon.  Did you hear what he said in Oregon? About me having too much power.	It's between Nixon and a Kennedy again, Edgar ... Who do you want?
3 Kennedy -- never.  He'll fry in hell for what he did to me.  But Nixon doesn't know that, which is why I'm gonna have to remind him he needs us a helluva lot more'n we need him.

1 Or he'll steal it like his brother. He's a mean little sonofabitch, Edgar ... He had the IRS audit my mother when she was dying in a nursing home.	I know ...

1 Thanks, Jack.  You sure throw a helluva party.	Party ain't started yet, Dick.  Got these gals coming over to the ranch later for a little private "thing," y'know ... There's some fellows I want you to meet.
2 Well, uh, Trini and I have an early plane.  We were hoping to get back to New York in time for ...

1 Because if you're uncomfortable with the EPA up your ass, try the IRS ...	Well, goddamn.  Are you threatening me, Dick?
2 Presidents don't threaten.  They don't have to.  Good day, gentlemen.

1 That's right!  And if necessary, I'll drop the big one.	We have to entertain the possibility ...

1 I was asleep, Mr. President.  What can I get you?	Just ... uh ... you know.
2 Of course.

1 We can prosecute the New York Times, go for an injunction ...	... but it's not, bottom-line, gonna change a goddamn thing, John.  The question is: How do we screw Ellsberg so bad it puts the fear of God into all leakers?

1 Get off that.  That leads nowhere. You should offer condolences to the families of those kids.	Sure, I'd like to offer condolences.

1 ... I don't really know you yet, Sandy ... What do you like?  I mean, what kind of clothes do you like?  Do you like blue ... red?	Oh, I like satin, I like pink ...
2 What kind of, uh ... music do you like?	I like jazz ...
3 Yeah ... Guy Lombardo ...	Elvis I like, too.
4 Oh yeah, he's good.

1 No, they want you, Mr. President.  I really think it would be a good move.	Gentlemen, I go now to discover the exact length, width and depth of the shaft.

1 Thank you, Fidel Castro.	You're not going to blame this on Castro, are you?
2 I sure am.  The goddamned missile crisis united the whole country behind Kennedy.  And he was supporting Brown. People were scared, that's why.	I suppose Castro staged the whole thing just to beat you.
3 Buddy, before you join the jubilation at my being beaten again, you should remember: People vote not out of love, but fear.  They don't teach that at Sunday School or at the Whittier Community Playhouse!

1 It was our dream, too, Buddy, together ... always.	Do you really want this, Dick?
2 This.  Above all.	And then you'll be happy?

1 What exactly did you want to discuss, Pat?	You.  What' you're doing --
2 And what am I doing?	I wish I knew.  You're hiding.
3 Hiding what?	Whatever it is you've always been hiding.  You're letting it destroy you, Dick.  You won't even ask for help.  You're destroying yourself, Dick.

1 Well, in any case, Rocky, I'll send you my book.  "Six Crises."	Whatcha predicting -- your boy Goldwater going to split the party?
2 Some say you are, Rocky.	The Republican Party was never home to extremists.  You should know better. This guy's as stupid as McCarthy, and McCarthy never did you any good in the long run, now did he?

1 I thought maybe she was with your boy there.	No ID in her room?
2 Not hardly nothin' in her room. And that establishment was no stickler on registration. Well...

1 You wouldn't think a car would burn like that.	Yessir. We should a brought wieners.

1 What about yours?	I'm hidin' behind you.

1 ...This month's checks.	That DEA agent called again. You don't want to talk to him?
2 I'm goin' to try and keep from it as much as I can.	He's goin' back out there and he wanted to know if you wanted to go with him.

1 No.	I ain't got the money.
2 No.	What little I had is long gone and they's bill aplenty to pay yet. I buried my mother today. I ain't paid for that neither.
3 I wouldn't worry about it.	...I need to sit down.

1 So... for how long do we have to...	Baby, at what point would you quit botherin' to look for your two million dollars?

1 Yessir?	I'm looking for Llewelyn Moss.
2 Did you go up to his trailer?	Yes I did.
3 Well I'd say he's at work. Do you want to leave a message?	Where does he work?
4 I can't say.	Where does he work?
5 Sir I ain't at liberty to give out no information about our residents.

1 What airport would you use.	Huh? Airport or airstrip?
2 Airport.	Well -- where ya goin'?
3 I don't know.	Just lightin' out for the territories, huh. Brother, I been there... Well...

1 ...Will there be somethin' else?	I don't know. Will there?

1 Look... I got to know what I stand to win.	Everything.
2 How's that?	You stand to win everything. Call it.
3 All right. Heads then.

1 We got a loose cannon here. And we're out a bunch of money, and the other party is out his product.	Yessir. I understand that.

1 Waitin' for my wife.	Oh. That's who you keep lookin' out the window for?
2 Half.	What else then?
3 Lookin' for what's comin'.	Yeah but no one ever sees that. I like a man that'll tell you he's married.
4 Then you'll like me.	I do like you.

1 How is she?	She's in a kind of shock. I see all the signs of a post-traumatic reaction with possible dissociative symptoms.
2 Could I have that in American?	It's a type of altered state... it allows a traumatized person to continue functioning.
3 So she did witness it?

1 So, you think you're gonna find his scalp hanging in some tepee?	They no longer live in tepees, Mr. College Graduate.
2 Did you send anyone out there?	You bet I did. I got a squad car on the way to the reservation right now.
3 Bad idea...	You just go write your little story, Roy. I'll handle the police work...
4 You better handle what's in this garbage can first.

1 Oww... Did you have to make these things so tight?	No, I didn't have to.

1 ...I s'pose you did that so I could take my sweater off or something.	No, just stand there... lemme look at you a minute.

1 Did... did you really come here because you love this guy?	Yes... Not the actor, though, the doctor. I think.

1 Halfway where? You've gotta come home. We've been worried sick about you. Are you alright?	Sue Ann, I thought you of all people would back me up on this, you know what Del's like. How did he take my note?
2 Betty, honey, listen to me. A man came by from Mutual Life Insurance. He says you've got money comin' to you from Del's policy.  Del's life insurance policy -- Are you with me?	What are you talking about?

1 Lyla's very nice.	Yes, she is.
2 She told me I was charming and relentless, and would go far in this town. And she said that unlike the other charming, relentless people she knew, she liked me.	She's a good person to know.  So where did you study again?
3 Carleton School of Nursing. Two semesters, but Del made me give it up...	Alright, okay... I think you broke the record for staying in character about three hours ago.
4 You told me that two hours ago.

1 But I'm David... I mean, I'm not David, but she thinks I am! You heard her...  Stop staring at me... I'm not crazy, she is!	Why are you screaming at me? I mean, what am I... why am I here? I don't...
2 You're doing this now? After all the... are you sick? Are you going to kill me now?	No, I... I'll leave. Forgive me if I caused you all any trouble... I just, I don't know how I...  ...I'm sorry.

1 Well, are you gonna answer me? What'd you come here for?	I came for love...
2 You're not on that soap opera thing again, are you? 'Cause you know what that is?	It's people with no lives watching other people's fake lives.
3 That's right. So, if you know it, why are you in trouble?	I don't know.
4 You sure don't. Who do you think you are coming to Hollywood, anyway? You should remember where you came from. And who you really are.

1 Where you headed, Betty?	Los Angeles, California.
2 And you called your friend, and she's telling you not to go?  When I went to Europe my friends told me I was crazy.	Europe? The Europe?  This is my first time out of Kansas.
3 I should call you Dorothy.  When I left here I went straight to Italy. Everybody told me not to go. But I wanted to go to Rome ever since I saw Audrey Hepburn in "Roman Holiday," and goddamnit, I went.	Did you love it?
4 Sure I loved it! It was great.

1 It's something I had to do. For David.	'David.' That's your guy. So, you staying with him?

1 Guess who I saw today.	Who?
2 Doctor David Ravell.	What? Where was he?!
3 ON TELEVISION!!  Cut the shit, will you!

1 This isn't fair, you know. Do you always get what you want?	No, almost never.
2 But, you're in love with someone who doesn't exist. You come here, you meet this guy, who should laugh in your face, and instead you leave with him!  Betty, you are one-of-a-kind...

1 That won't be necessary. She's staying with a Rosa something... Hernandez, Herrera. I know it's an 'H' sound... in Silverlake.	Thanks so much. You must get bothered by this kind of thing a lot.
2 More than you know. Is there anything else?	No, that should be more than --
3 Good.

1 Could you give us an example?	Of what?
2 I'm asking you for an example of one of these dumb fucks being a dumb fuck.	I don't follow...
3 You're not a dumb fuck, are you, Del?	No...
4 I didn't think so. So, give me an example of a stupid person doing a stupid thing. Not being stupid, you're equipped to recognize it.	Are we gonna do business here, or not?

1 Hold still, Del, we're just talking here...  Then you grab a big handful of hair and pull as you cut. It's amazing how easily the scalp comes off.	A mark, huh?

1 What the hell was that, another statement?	Well, no one ever spit in my face before. Especially some cracker fuck.
2 You have to rise above it. The professionals rise above that kind of thing...

1 They said find it. Find her, find it. Finish the job you were paid to do.	Half.
2 What?	They paid us half. They still owe us half...
3 There it is again. That lousy attitude that got us here in the first place. That "make a statement," do an end zone dance, shake your ass and sue everybody in sight attitude that's dragging this whole country down the drain.  They don't owe us shit, Wesley! WHEN YOU FINISH THE JOB, YOU GET PAID!! WE HAVEN'T FINISHED THE GODDAMN JOB!!

1 Well, guess what? I found Betty... where she's been, anyway.	Where? Where is she?
2 I'm not telling.	What?
3 I'm not telling 'til you straighten up. You been acting like fucking Jerry Lewis on me and this shit's gotta stop or you can forget about your Betty... I mean it.

1 I don't like talking bad about the dead, but now that he's gone I can tell you she put up with things in that marriage I wouldn't have. And yes, she, of all people, was the one who defended him. And that's why what that sheriff said makes me so angry.	What do you mean?
2 If anyone had paid to have that husband of hers killed, it would have been me.	Mrs. Blaine? I can tell you right now, without a doubt, that your granddaughter is alive, and did not kill Del Sizemore.

1 She makes me stretch! I got inside my character last night like I haven't done in six years on "Reason". It was a totally rejuvenating experience.	I know, George, I was there. I'm not denying that she's good.
2 She's even taken a job as a nurse!  David Ravell's getting boring, Lyla.	We know that...
3 Can I have an evil twin?	No, George, we've already done that with Lonnie. The blind one last year, remember?
4 Oh, of course. Who can forget the Emmy?  Then let me bring Betty to the set and see what happens.	I don't know, George...
5 I'll tell the cast ahead of time. What do you say?	I'll think about it.
6 It'll be like live television! Let's live on the edge a little. You and I can break the mold here!	I said I'll think about it.
7 Fine, but promise me one thing. If we use her, I want to direct those episodes. She's my discovery.	Actually, she was my discovery... just like you.
8 Hmm?	"Would you like ground pepper on that salad, Ms. Branch?" Remember?
9 ...yeah.

1 You've got to be missing a piece of your soul to kill someone. That's not our Betty...	...why do you think you have to be missing a piece of your soul to kill somebody?
2 Because it ain't natural, young man.	What are you talking about? Killing's totally natural. It's dying that isn't natural...

1 Aren't they precious?  Ma'am, she has a substantial death benefit coming to her from the tragic loss of her husband. Does she have any relatives in the area?	No.  Well, her grandparents are down in Oklahoma, but that's it...
2 I see. And are you in touch with Mrs. Sizemore?	No. But I'm taping her show every day so she can watch it when she comes back.
3 Her show?	"A Reason to Love."

1 We ain't gonna make it walkin'.	Gopher, Everett?

1 NOW HOLD ON, BOYS-AINTCHA EVER HEARD OF A NEGOTIATION? MAYBE WE CAN TALK THIS THING OUT!	Yeah, let's negotiate 'em, Everett.

1 Whuhh...	Oh sweet Lord, Everett, looka this!

1 'N turned into a frog -	He was never turned into a frog!

1 What's his name again?	Campaign manager? Waldrip.

1 McGill. No, the marriage'll take place as planned.	Just a little change of cast. Me and the little lady are gonna pick up the pieces'n retie the knot, mixaphorically speakin'. You boys're invited, of course. Hell, you're best men! Already got the rings.

1 Huh?! They dam that river on the 21st.  Today's the 17th!	Don't I know it.
2 We got but four days to get to that treasure! After that, it'll be at the bottom of a lake!

1 The hell it ain't square one! Ain't no one gonna pick up three filthy unshaved hitchhikers, and one of 'em a know-it-all that can't keep his trap shut!	Pete, the personal rancor reflected in that remark I don't intend to dignify with comment, but I would like to address your general attitude of hopeless negativism. Consider the lilies a the goddamn field, or-hell!- take a look at Delmar here as your paradigm a hope.

1 Pete... I do apologize.	Eighty-four years old! I'll be gummin' pab-you-lum!

1 Languishing! Goddamn campaign is languishing! We need a shot inna arm!  Hear me, boys? Inna goddamn ARM!  Election held tomorra, that sonofabitch Stokes would win it in a walk!	Well he's the reform candidate, Daddy.

1 How was the flight? They take care of you okay? Long way from Norfolk, isn't it?	Yes, sir.
2 Listen, kid, I was sorry to hear about your mom. That's pretty rough. I would've returned your call a lot sooner but I was out at sea...	I been calling for four months.
3 Well, that's how long I've been out at sea.

1 Who's that?	Nobody. Just a girl I've been making it with the last couple of weekends.
2 Great ass.	Yeah, I sort of thought so myself.
3 Better watch out for that kind, Zackie. You know what they call 'em, don't ya?	Yeah, I know.
4 Back east in Newport, Rhode Island, they call 'em the Fall River Debs. In Pensacola, the Mobile Debs. In Norfolk --	That what she was... a Norfolk Deb?
5 Who?  Aw shit, Zackie, let's not get off on your mother again, please.	What if I want to talk about her, pard? What then? You know, that's all I've ever heard from you, since I was a kid... you never want to talk about that, man, and it's important.
6 There's nothing to talk about. Two goddamn times I made it with your old lady. We barely even talked.

1 He doesn't mean anything by it, Zack. Do you, Joe?	I don't mean anything by it.

1 You didn't kick him out...? Wait, didn't he tell you what he's been going through?	It doesn't matter what he's going through. That's the whole purpose of this zoo. What matters is he freaked out for some reason at twenty-five thousand feet and that can't ever happen again.
2 But you don't understand. There's this girl he's gotten pregnant and she's putting him through hell, sir.

1 What did you call me, Mayo?	Zack, don't!

1 Something tells me you've been here before.	Now what on earth would give you an idea like that?

1 Come on, guys. It's five o'clock.	One more minute.

1 God help you, Lynette!	You're no better than me, Paula! You're just the same!
2 No! That's not true!

1 I shouldn't have done that. I should've walked.	He didn't give you much choice.
2 There's always a choice.	Where'd you learn to fight like that?
3 I don't feel like talking, if you don't mind.	Opening up just a little wouldn't kill you, ya know.

1 You know, sometimes I wish I was one of those girls they're letting in the flight program these days. God, I'd love to fly.	What's stopping you?

1 Zack, do you ever think about what it'd be like to have kids... a family.	No. Is that what you want?
2 Some day. When I'm sure I can do a better job of it than my folks.	What would you do differently?
3 For a start, I wouldn't marry a man I wasn't in love with.	Why'd your mom marry that guy if she didn't love him?
4 Because my real father wouldn't marry her.	Your real father?

1 I see you didn't DOR, Mayo.	Hey, Sid, thanks.

1 Nice, hospitable folks they get around here.  I hope she comes.	She'll come, pard. A rich socialite Oakie like you oughta be a big catch around these parts.
2 Get off my case, Mayo. I didn't grow up rich.

1 It's a big religious thing with her and she won't even discuss it.	But she expects you to marry her?
2 She said it was up to me. If I don't, she'll go off and have the baby on her own somewhere.

1 What if she called the cops?	She didn't.

1 Are you okay?	Hurry up, for Christ's sake!

1 The walls are steel, right?	Not that one.
2 NOT THAT ONE?!	Hey man, it's the neighbor's house, who breaks in through the neighbor's house?!

1 Asshole.	A guy shows you a gun, Burnham, and you insult him?  Hey, who's the idiot?  Huh?
2 Where did you get this clown?	I met him at the tables, same as you.  And frankly, I'm grateful we have a little muscle right about now.
3 What tables?  I've never seen him before.	Different tables.
4 The fuck did you bring a gun for?

1 Hey man, after all we went through I am not walking out when we're this close.	Close?  Are you insane?  We're nowhere near close!  Fuck this, I'll make an anonymous phone call on Monday, they'll find the floor safe, and I'll inherit the shit.  Little piece of it, anyway, it's better than nothing.
2 What about us?

1 I don't have to tell you there is an acute shortage of living space in Manhattan right now and this is a highly unique property.	No ball, kid.

1 That's highly inappropriate.	I said open the door.

1 Makes me nervous.	Why?
2 Ever read any Poe?	I don't think so, but I love her album.
3 No, Edgar Allen.	The furniture guy?
4 What's to keep them from prying open the door?

1 "What we want is in that room."	They're coming in here, aren't they?
2 No, I told you, they can't.  It's not a possibility.

1 We're never getting out of here.	Shhh...

1 Where is the Glucogen?	Oh, you know, it's uh... it's in the little fridge in your room.
2 I'm sorry, Mom.	Hey, quit apologizing, you're starting to sound like Grandma. You're not gonna have an attack. Okay?
3 Okay.

1 For the last time Boy!!! What do those guns mean??!!	They mean, Pig!, that the Black Panther Party declares that if you try to brutalize our community or take our weapons.  We are going to shoot you!!!

1 What the fuck?	Brimmer! Could you come in here please?

1 Go! Run! Go on! Get the fuck out of here!!	What? So you can shoot me? Call it resisting arrest?
2 I ain't gonna shoot you Judge. Look... it's over. Just run away. Get out. Stay away from Oakland. Cause it's gone... it's gone.	Brimmer you're fucked up...
3 Yeah... I'm fucked up. You're fucked up. Government's fucked up. Whole country's fucked up. You got no idea what's going on here. This is bigger than you and me. We're just little tiny soldiers getting moved around on some big asshole's desk. The Panthers... fuck you're history... they killed you and you don't even know it.	Who's they?
4 Drugs Judge, they're gonna flood West Oakland with dope. Jack you up and string you out like a two dollar whore. And while the community's shuffling for a fix, they're gonna snuff every Panther they can find.	Who? I mean besides the FBI?
5 I don't know. Except, it's one of you. Maybe not a Panther, but it's someone from the neighborhood. Judge. Look, just go. Get away. It's over. You lost.  We all lost.

1 ...Glad you came man.	Yeah, only I figure you'd be the one doing the speaking.
2 Not yet, one of these day's maybe. Bobby's party chairman. Political Education's really his bag.

1 Rodgers... this is no good...	Cut the crap, you've been taking the man's money for years. Now it's time you earned it.

1 That's right brother... listen and learn.	The white power structure wants us to act like savages.  But we're a different kind of animal altogether. We're Panthers. And The Black Panther Party for Self Defense is very painfully aware that America has historically reserved its most barbaric treatment for non-white people since the beginning of the country. So we need to organize, we  keep our shit correct! And effect revolution. We revolve the power into the hands of the people. Where it belongs.  Power to the people baby...

1 We put our lives on the line today. Malcolm X's widow was on the line today. And your guns weren't even loaded.	A gun's a gun man. It don't need to be loaded.
2 Tell that to the pigs. Better yet tell that to Malcolm.	Wait a second there brother...
3 No you wait a second. You and your "Panthers" got three choices. One you join with us and follow our rules. Two you change your name.  Or three you face annihilation.

1 What's the pig's name?	Brimmer.
2 You got to keep very cool on this. Icy god damn cool. Cause baby, you just became the strongest weapon we got. Let me guess, he wants you to call him, tell him what we're doing.	Yeah.
3 And you're gonna do just that. But I'll tell you what to feed the pig. You alright with this?	Yeah... I guess. Any of other Panthers know about this?

1 Busted firing pin.  You want only the legal stuff right?	Just the legit shit.

1 We'll all get out of here together.	Later for that. I'm done either way...

1 You meet those friends of yours in jail too?	Yes... No... Mom it's not like you think. They're alright. There out there trying to do something.
2 I hear them boys, those Black Panthers, they're communists. They don't even believe in God.	Mom, black folks been praying to God for four hundred years. Maybe it's time we tried something else...
3 You believe that?	I don't know. I really don't.

1 Well?	I've just been inside the mind of a genius.  Lord Cornwallis knows more about war than I could in a dozen lifetimes.
2 Cheerful news to greet the morn.	His victories at Charleston and Camden were perfect, strategically, tactically, logistically.  But he has a weakness.

1 And send us to war alongside Massachusetts.	Our governor is a bigger fool than I thought.

1 You are familiar with how these things are done.  In fact, I would like to claim aggrieved status.	Very well, proceed, sir.
2 First, you have in your possession certain belongings of mine, including clothing, private papers, furniture and personal effects of a non-military nature which I would like to have returned to me.	I will do so as soon as possible.

1 Father, a post rider came from Charleston.  You have a letter inside.	Thank you.  How's the spotted one's milk?

1 Did your father teach you humility?	He tried.  It didn't take.

1 She spoke?  Susan spoke?	Full sentences.  As if she had been speaking all along.
2 I don't believe it... and I wasn't there for it...

1 If this war is about more than Thomas, it's about more than Anne, as well.  Stay the course.	As you did at Fort Wilderness?

1 Wars are not fought only by childless men.  A man must weigh his personal responsibilities against his principles.	That's what I'm doing.  I will not fight and because I won't, I will not cast a vote that will send others to fight in my stead.
2 And your principles?	I'm a parent, I don't have the luxury of principles.

1 How far away?	Four, five miles.

1 Francis, tell me about General Cornwallis.	Remember Braddock?
2 That bad?	Worse.
3 Proud, priggish and competent.  A very bad combination in an adversary.

1 But where are we going, Mr. Crandall?	You'll see soon enough, hon.

1 Paxcow says it's almost too late!	Ellie...Ellie...what...
2 Paxcow says it's almost too late! We have to go back! Paxcow says it's almost too late!

1 That's what I think. I heard Missy Dandridge tell Mom when Church was fixed he wouldn't cross the road so much.	Well, it's always better to take precautions--but I'm sure Church will be all right, honey...

1 At school Michael McDowell said she was gonna fry in hell. Michael McDowell says all sewersides fry in hell.	Well, I think Michael McDowell is so full of shit he probably squeaks when he walks, my dear.

1 How can you call it a good thing? A graveyard for pets killed in the road! Built and maintained by broken- hearted children!	Well, but Missus Creed! It ain't quite that way, deah!

1 Not yet...how much further is it?	Aw, you'll be okay. Less than a mile.

1 Jud, this is crazy. It's going to be almost dark before we get back.	It's going to be dark before we even get where we're going, Louis. But we can do it...and we're going to.
2 But--	Does she love the cat?
3 Yes, but--	Then come on.

1 What are those for?	Your cairn.

1 Rachel not feeling well?	Well...a touch of the flu...

1 The door must not be opened. The barrier must not be crossed.	You don't understand--

1 She's finally asleep.	She was a little over-excited, that's all. Poor kid.
2 It was that place. That creepy cemetery up in the woods. Whatever disease the kids in this town have got, I don't want Ellie to catch it.	Jesus, Rachel, what's got into you?
3 Do you think I didn't hear her tonight, crying as if her heart would break? Here she is thinking Church is going to die.

1 You better get going, hon.	Oh Louis, I just don't know about this--
2 I told you last night--this can be the start of patching things up with your folks. If something good doesn't come of Gage's death, I think I'll go crazy.	Louis, are you sure?
3 I'm sure.

1 I know whose blood you need, to end the curse.	Say the name, or I slit your throat.
2 No you won't.

1 No, I really think I do.	All right then.

1 That's proper, sir, according to the code.	By the powers, you're right!  Where's Jack's pistol?  Who's got it?  Bring it forward!

1 Oh, there would be no sense in killing you, Miss Turner.	Then why aren't you eating?
2 Would that I could.

1 Elizabeth, I'm relieved you're safe.  Clap him in irons.  And behind his back this time.	Commodore, you can't do that!
2 You're speaking up for him again?	He can locate Isla de Muerta -- but I doubt he'll be willing to help us from the brig.

1 Difficult ... to say.	I'm told that dress is the very latest fashion in London.
2 Women in London must have learned to not breathe.

1 You are despicable.	I saved your life; now you've saved mine.  We're square.

1 That was before I met one, of course.	Now I must hear this song.  An authentic pirate song.  Have at it.
2 Well, perhaps ... with a bit more to drink, I might ...	More to drink!

1 Say again?	I'm going after the Black Pearl. I know where it's going to be, and I'm going to take it.
2 Jack, it's a fool's errand: You've heard the tales they tell about the Pearl.	Aye, and that's why I know where it's going to be, and that's why I know what Barbossa is up to.  All I need is a crew.
3 A fool's errand.	Not if the fool has something Barbossa wants.  Something he needs.
4 And you've got that, have you?

1 We can at least fight -- we might be able to kill a few--	Will -- it'll go worse for us -- for Elizabeth, especially -- if we fight.

1 What's your name?	Smith.

1 Do you think this is wise, boy? Crossing blades with a pirate?	You threatened Miss Swann.
2 Only a little.

1 We're going to steal a ship?  That ship?	Commandeer.  We're going to commandeer a ship.  Nautical term.
2 It's still against the law.	So's breaking a man out of jail. Face it, Will: you may say you'll never be a pirate, but you're off to a rip-roaring start.  My advice -- smile and enjoy it.

1 But I survived.  And I still have that single shot.  It's meant for one man.  My mutinous first mate--	Barbossa.

1 There's no *real* ship as can match the Interceptor.	The Black Pearl is a real ship.
2 No, it's not.	Yes it is.  I've seen it.
3 You've seen it?	Yes.
4 You've seen the Black Pearl?	Yes.
5 You haven't seen it.	Yes, I have.
6 You've seen a ship with black sails that's crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that hell itself spat him back out?	... No.
7 No.	But I've seen a ship with black sails.
8 Oh, and no ship that's not crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that hell itself spat him back out could possibly have black sails and therefore couldn't possibly be any ship other than the Black Pearl.  Is that what you're saying?	... no.
9 Like I said, there's no real ship as can match -- Hey!

1 Mr. Sim, when you do locate him.  Do not scare him off again.  Just watch him.  I think you can handle that. Right, Mr. Sim?	You got it, Dr. Argon.

1 I brought you up here, Dr. Bright, because I want you to understand that we are on the path.  The only difference is that you are walking with your head down, afraid to look up, to see where the path is going.	I suppose you are going to tell me where it is going.
2 I ask you what is the purpose of science?  What is the point of all our relentless exploration, investigation and experimentation? It is to understand a single physical phenomenon, or to understand them all?  To cure one disease, or to cure every disease? If science is simply a means, what then is the end?

1 How apropos.	Ain't it.

1 It works, Poppy.  It works, it works!	Now, Icky, I don't need you winding yourself up.  I need you focused and in control.
2 But, Poppy, you don't know what this means --	You don't either.  We won't know anything until we find that guy and find out if he's alive or what.
3 Yes, that's true.  We have to find him, run tests, determine if the polymerization is stable.	In the meantime, we're going to need someone to deal with that mess in the lab.  I don't think we should call Dr. Bright.
4 Oh no.  No.  We'll get her assistant.  What's-his-name? Nebbishman?	Nebbleman.

1 It will be an ascension.	I'm so excited, Icarus.

1 They're here!  They're here!  We have the nanobot.	Excellent.  How long until the assembler tank is complete?

1 Do you remember about five years ago, that uh... incident at Purnell Labs?	Oh yeah.  They were working on molecular assemblers, too, weren't they?
2 They also tried using viral R.N.A. as the bonding element.	That's right.  C.D.C. found out and closed them down...

1 You want to tell me what I'm looking for?	I've only been invited to her house once, but I know there is a basement lab that she uses for private research.
2 Okay.

1 Yeah.	Well, it was good to see you, Daniel, but I have to be going.
2 Sure.  Can I ask you one more thing? You haven't published anything in a while.  How come?

1 You don't know?	It escaped from the lab before we could finish the experiment.
2 But you've polymerized single-celled bacteria and the fruit flies, I know you have.	Yes.
3 Then you must have at some point tried to reverse the procedure.

1 That was an egg?	Three days ago it was.
2 What do these replicators do to people?	With enough exposure, the same thing they do to everything else.

1 Just like old times.	Yeah.  Old times.

1 You made this out of my hair?	Sort of.  We used a process similar to the vulcanization of rubber and added bulk with a chain of chloroprene elastomers.

1 That means the nanobot is still inside him.	Yes.
2 What would happen if I threw him into the core?	The same thing I suppose.

1 Maybe you're ready to find out if that hide of yours is bulletproof?	The question is, are you?

1 It might be paranoia, but I've never lost my keycard before.	'Paranoia is what separates the secured from the unsecured.'

1 I'm sure you're quite willing to be decent about this.	Decent? Why Miss Schuyler, I want to be noble.

1 I suppose you're going to print them?	No - give you another guess.

1 Why should I? We're happy, aren't we, darling?	Throw me out - because I'm beginning to get goofy ideas, and they concern you, Anne.
2 None of your ideas can be goofy, Stew, if they concern me.	My name is Smith - well, that you seem to have been able to stand for the last month. I'm white, male and over twenty-one. I've never been in jail - that is, not often. And I prefer Scotch to Bourbon. I hate carrots, I hate peas, I like black coffee and I hate garters. I make seventy-five bucks a week and I've got eight hundred and forty-seven bucks in the bank - and - I don't know yet whether your eyes are blue or violet.
3 That's because you're too far away, Stew.

1 Oh, yes you will my dear - oh, yes you will my dear - you'll wear garters and you'll like it too!	Oh, no I won't my dear - oh, no I won't my dear - I'll wash behind my ears, but no I won't my dear!

1 I'm not going!	What are you talking about?
2 I'm talking about - I'm not going out.	What am I going downstairs and tell those people?
3 Go downstairs, and tell them - anything. Tell them I'm not going. Tell them I'm not home.	Stewart, would you mind telling me why you're not going?
4 Yes, I'll tell you - for the same reason I've never wanted to go out with those social parasites, those sweet-smelling fashion plates. I don't like them. They bore me. They give me the jitters.

1 It's a good thing your father passed away before he saw insanity ravage the family. I can't imagine what made you do such a thing. A reporter! Of all things, a reporter! A barbarian who lets his socks come down!	Mother, I promise you that he won't be a reporter much longer. Once I get him away from that atmosphere and get him away from a man named Gallagher
2 Sit down!

1 I got him his job on the paper. I'm a stock-holder, you know.	Is that so?
2 As one Tribune man to another

1 Big Chief Bingy come to white man's tepee to make friends. Big Chief very sorry. To show how sorry - will bend over and let white man kick Big Chief where sun never shines.	Excuse me, Gallagher. I wouldn't miss this one for the world.

1 Mr. Schuyler .	Now get this, Conroy. My name is Smith. Always was Smith - and always gonna be Smith.
2 Is that so?	That's so.

1 All right, outside!	I beg your pardon, sir?
2 Outside!

1 Well, I've seen her pictures, and I don't think she's so hot.	Oh, you don't appreciate it. Her pictures don't do her justice. Why, Gallagher, she's queenly - she is queenly - and I know queens!  And oh, has she got herself a nose - and I know noses too. That little snozzle of hers is the berries, I tell you. And is she cute when she throws that little snozzle to the high heavens!
2 Of course I haven't got a nose.

1 Mr. Smith, I've read some of your plays and I'd like an autograph.	Well, well! If it isn't my old friend! Turn around, gal! Let's get a look at you.
2 There you are!	Well, daughter of the slums - how did you get out of the ghetto?
3 I'm pinch-hitting for our society editor tonight. I wanted to see some life in the raw.	Aw, you wanted to see some life in the raw, huh? Well gal, I'm afraid we ain't got no raw life up here.
4 Well, I'll have to look someplace else.	No, no! Maybe we could interest you in some well done butterflies, or perhaps some slightly fried pansies, or better still, some stuffed shirts. And guaranteed every one of them will give you a good stiff pain in the neck.
5 Say, who's been tying your ties lately? It looks rotten.

1 Stewart, have you ever been to Old Madrid?	Been where?
2 To Old Madrid.	Never even been to New Madrid.
3 Then how do you expect to write about it?	Oh - draw on my imagination, I suppose.
4 Did Conrad draw on his imagination?

1 Well, well. That takes it out of the rumor class, doesn't it?	We admit nothing. However, I have a little statement all prepared.

1 Yes.	And now for that twentieth crack

1 Dexter Grayson, you told me it was only ten thousandand you didn't even get those letters from that Jezebel!	Oh, so you did give her ten thousand dollars, eh? and there are letters...

1 Now, now Jeeves.[5] Was that nice? Was that being a gentleman, Jeeves? Was it, Jeeves? Your name is Jeeves, isn't it?	The name is Smythe.
2 Smythe! Well, well, well! With a Y , huh?  Congratulations! What a small world. Brothers under livery. Shake!  Now, as a Smith to a Smythe	Mrs. Schuyler is not at home.
3 I know, I know. I waited outside till she went out. She's a very nice lady, but we don't vibrate well together.

1 It isn't done, gentlemen! It isn't done, I say! It isn't done!	Well, Gallagher, you certainly took no chances, did you?

1 Bu-ud ... Mary Sue ... Your breakfast is getting cold.	It can't be possible.

1 I'm so proud of you, Bud.	Thanks ... I love you.
2 I love you too.

1 What is that?	I don't know.

1 Okay--now you listen to me ...  You're gonna come to this meeting and you're gonna put on this make up, and you're gonna come home at six o'clock every night and have dinner ready on this table.	No I'm not sweetie.

1 It's s'posed to happen, Biff.	It is?
2 Trust me ...

1 Want some bridge mix?	Oh, no thanks ...
2 Betty's making some pineapple kabobs ...	I'm fine--but thank you.

1 Bud Parker and William Johnson, you have been charged with desecration of a public building and the intentional use of prohibited paint colors in violation of the Pleasantville Code of Conduct and laws of common decency. Do you admit that on the night of May 1, you did consciously and willfully apply the following FORBIDDEN colors to the Pleasantville Town Hall:  Red, Pink, Vermillion, Puce, Chartreuse, Umber, Blue, Aqua, Ox Blood, Green, Peach, Crimson, Yellow, Olive and Magenta.	Um ... Yes I do. Where's our lawyer?
2 We prefer to keep these proceedings as "pleasant" as possible. I don't think a lawyer will be necessary.

1 What's outside of Pleasantville?	Look it doesn't matter. It's not important.
2 What is it?

1 Oh my God.	What happened?
2 I'm not sure.

1 No way.	One date, Jen--that's all I'm asking. If you don't go out with this guy we could throw their whole universe out of whack.
2 It's too weird David. This place is giving me the creeps. Did you know all the books are blank?	What?
3 I looked in the library. They got covers with nothing inside them.	What were you doing in a library?
4 I got lost.  Oh here ... look at this!

1 I had nothing to do with that fire.	It's okay.
2 Not directly anyhow ...	It's fine.

1 You got the admissions letter.	Right here.
2 And you're sure about this?	I've done the slut thing, David. It's really kinda old.

1 You want some berries?	Hunh?

1 Salesman. What did Bud and Mary Sue name the cat they found in the gutter?	Scout?
2 Marmalade.

1 Look--we appreciate it. We really do. We just--we want to go home now.	But you don't know how long I've been looking for someone like you.

1 Hope you're proud of yourself.	I am actually ... Glad to see you've finally shown your true colors.

1 There aren't any cheeseburgers.	What?
2 Well, usually I put out the burger and then you finish with the lettuce ...	Listen to me!

1 Oh, hi.	Hi.
2 Aren't you a little early?	I brought you something ... From the library.

1 Free?	Oh sure. Big fan like yourself. It's the least I could do.

1 ...yes I'm still on hold...	And what was this?
2 I'm looking at your advertisement for the airline promotion and giveaway?	This is "Fly With Us?"
3 It's hard to understand because it says in addition to but I can't exactly understand in addition to what because there's actually nothing to add it too...	I think that's a type-o then, that would be a mistake.
4 So, just to clarify, I'm sorry: Ten purchases of any of your Healthy Choice products equals five hundred miles and then with the coupon the same purchases would value one thousand miles --	That's it.
5 Do you realize that the monetary value of this promotion and the prize is potentially worth more than the purchases?	I don't know...I mean: I don't know.

1 It's not cool?	It's fine, but --
2 -- do you think you'll ask her out?	I feel really on the spot now.
3 Are you gonna do it?	I don't do that. I don't - things like that.
4 You don't do anything, why are you being scared?	I'm not being scared, you're just going to rag me if I do this --
5 I'm not gonna rag you. Why would I do this just to rag you?	I don't know.
6 I'll leave then, I'll go to get something from my car, go away so you don't feel pressure. Can I ask you a serious question:	What?
7 Did you ask Walter to get you a shrink?  Barry, did you ask Walter to get you a shrink? What's wrong with you? Are you ok?	I didn't ask him that. He's lying.
8 You're being weird again, see. Come on. Please don't be weird.

1 So you think you can?	No. I'm sorry.
2 Should I call back and talk to your girlfriend?	....what....?
3 I was wondering if it's better to ask your girlfriend for the money? It could be really easy. I mean, I have all your information, credit card information and billing stuff --

1 Business is good, you're busy?	Yeah, not really.
2 I saw a picture of you.	Yes. LENA Elizabeth has a picture of you guys -- your sisters and you, it's a lot of family, it must be nice.
3 Do you have brothers or sisters?	No. I'm the exact opposite --
4 That must be nice. That must be really, really, really great.	It's terrible, no.

1 That's very nice. Thank you. Thank you for saying that.  You're friends with my sister?	Yeah.
2 How long have you known her?	About six months.
3 You like her?	Yeah. Yeah we get along well.  You didn't get along with her very well?
4 Did you really come to meet me on purpose or are you lying about that?	No, no. I did.
5 That's nice. It's nice.  I've been looking around a lot lately at promotional giveaways, cross promotional work by some companies. Do you remember all that pudding?	Yeah.
6 So that pudding was bought, I bought that pudding because of a pretty interesting promotion that's sponsored by Healthy Choice and American Airlines. It's designed to encourage airline travel and obviously designed to encourage buying Healthy Choice products. They make frozen meals, deli meats, pasta sauce, breads, soups and ice creams, this sort of thing.....	Yeah?
7 ....I'm sorry....I lost my thoughts, what I was saying....	You were talking about the promotion --
8 -- the promotion says: buy any 10 Healthy Choice products and get 500 miles of airline travel or 1,000 for purchases made with a special coupon. So in the supermarket, you notice their products, first you notice they have a Teriyaki Chicken Dinner at $1.79 - that's a pretty good deal....but then I noticed they had soup at 89 cents a can.....and you start to do the math and you start to notice that it's a really amazing deal because I stumbled across the pudding at 25 cents a cup. Now the crucial thing is the bar codes on the label. That's those little bar codes, you know? The universal product codes?	Yeah.
9 That's what's used to redeem the mileage, so in noticing the pudding, each cup had an individual bar code -- in other words: Two dollars and fifty cents for ten cups of pudding is 500 miles. Add in the coupon: it's one thousand. You see?	Yeah.
10 You see?	Yeah, no, I see --
11 You see if you spent $3,000 dollars on pudding you could earn over one million frequent flyer miles.	That's insane. That is really, really crazy. That's just crazy if you spend three thousand dollars on pudding.
12 ....yeah....	So that was your pudding?
13 ....No....	I'm sorry. I thought you said --
14 No I didn't say that.	I thought you said you bought all that pudding --
15 My friend Carlos is doing it who works with me. It's his. It's his pudding, he's doing it. It's not mine. He's crazy. I told him not to do it. He's the one who's insane. He only spent about one hundred dollars so far though --	Your sister was telling me a pretty funny story about you, when you guys were kids and you were building a ramp for your dog and you threw a hammer through a window? Is that right? You threw a hammer through a sliding glass door?

1 Do you wanna have sex?	Yeah.

1 Yeah.	Did you do it?
2 No.	You didn't just smash up the bathroom?
3 No.	Well who did?
4 I don't know.	You're hand is bleeding.
5 I cut myself.	How?
6 On my knife.	Sir, a young man saw you coming out of the bathroom.
7 I didn't do that.	Why? ...what?
8 Your hand is bleeding.	I know.
9 I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.	Why?
10 Sir, I have no way of proving that you demolished the bathroom --	I didn't do it.
11 Alright, well you're gonna have to leave. You're gonna have to go.	Yeah, but I didn't do anything.
12 I'm gonna call the police then, sir.	Please don't do this to me.
13 The police are on their way.	Sorry.

1 How many sisters do you have?	....I have seven.

1 Why is it here? Barry....Barry?	...it just....I don't know....I don't know.

1 Hey.	Hi.
2 I need to talk to you for a second.	What?
3 You gotta give me some money.

1 Your expenses are your own.	I thought Latisha said you would --
2 -- she didn't know what she was talking about --	It's....whatever....that's not cool.
3 David, Don't. Just. Seriously. It doesn't make sense if you think about it in a fair deal like sense. Ok? It's business. Seriously. One hundred dollars for two days work is a lot more than your family is making sitting around your house. I'm serious now. Ok. Please. Now. Just stop.

1 Are you ready?	Will you call me later to talk about asking Walter for the shrink? And we can talk about - he said you have this crying problem or something?
2 Bye, Barry.

1 Marquis? Is that you?	For fuck's sake, who else would it be? The witching hour's arrived; you've alerted the others, yes?
2 I'm no longer a man! I awoke to discover I'd turned into a sparrow!

1 Ow!	But why heap such ghastly fantasies atop an already ghastly existence?
2 I put myself in his stories. I play the parts. Each strumpet, each murderess.	Why not act the role of heroines instead? Queen Esther from the Bible, or St. Joan?
3 If I wasn't such a bad woman on the page, Abbe, I'll hazard I couldn't be such a good woman in life.

1 Free his mouth.	Mustn't do that, sir.
2 I must grant him his last rites.	I don't take my orders from you; not anymore.
3 You'd deny a dying man his salvation?

1 Perhaps -- in time -- you'll earn them back through good behavior --	You can't --! You mustn't --! I've all the demons of hell in my head; my only salvation is to vent them on paper --
2 Try reading, for a change. The writer who produces more than he reads? The sure mark of an amateur.

1 OFF WITH YOUR CLOTHES!	Coulmier, you animal!
2 I DO NOT MEAN TO FLIRT, MARQUIS!	Oh, but you must, my pumpkin! Sex without flirtation is merely rape!
3 NOW STRIP.

1 Indiscretions, Abbe? Please. I've read his case history. At sixteen, he violated a serving girl with a crucifix. After six months in the dungeon at Vincennes, he mutilated a prostitute, cutting her flesh with a razor, then cauterizing the wounds with wax --	I hope you'll judge him by his progress here, and not his past reputation.

1 He's more than a patient, Doctor; the Marquis is my friend --	You keep strange company, Abbe. But if you truly have matters in hand here --
2 I have.	-- then I've friends of my own to visit.

1 My, my. You have exceeded my expectations.	And my own.
2 How is the patient faring?	Poorly.
3 And you? It must've been an ordeal.	I'm not the first man God has asked to shed blood in His name. I will not be the last.
4 Will you sleep soundly tonight?	No, sir. Plainly put, I never expect to sleep again.

1 Quickly, my suckling, out of your clothes! My scepter awaits; how solid it grows!	Stop, I beg you! Have pity, I say! You're not my lover; you're a monstrous rou!

1 If only these coins purchased your other talents, too.	There's something else I want from you.
2 You've already stolen my heart, as well as another more prominent organ, south of the Equator...	Your publisher says I'm not to leave without a new manuscript.
3 I've just the story... inspired by these very surroundings....

1 The Abbe's sending me away. He fears for me here, what with the likes of you --	Don't be fooled, Madeleine! He fears for himself. He's like a man starving, and you -- ha! -- you're like a pork chop dolloped with heavy cream --
2 He's a man of God; he's true to his vows.	First and foremost, he's a MAN. You remind him of that fact, and he resents you for it.

1 If you're truly determined to step out of the shadow of your husband's celebrity --	Oh, but I am!
2 -- words alone are insufficient.	It's beyond perversity. That honor should carry a price tag...

1 I beg you, Donatien... as your wife... your only ally... you must stop making such a monstrous spectacle of yourself.	You've come to lecture me?
2 To flaunt your deviance in public? Upon a stage?	They've put you up to this, haven't they?
3 You ought to court the Doctor's favor, not his contempt.

1 God, these parties are the worst	You need to get outta here, Rapunzel
2 That's why he has the parties, he says it's like bringing the world to me.	Why don't you come down to LA? Stay with us for a while.
3 With about twenty of his spies on my tail. No thanks.

1 Mm. Not a very good picture I am told.	Uh-hub.
2 Apparently it details the exploits of a publisher like myself. Entirely too much like myself. Do you follow so far?	Yeah

1 How does one get 125 million dollars in debt?	One . . . buys things.

1 I want blood	Good. Retain that feeling. Let it nourish you from this day forth. It shall nourish us both

1 That's right, fella, no Hearst paper will run an RKO ad until you agree that CITIZEN KANE will never see the light of day.	Louella, please, be reasonable, I understand you have problems with Orson's picture but maybe we can work something out--
2 Nix, sweetie. You shelve it	Oh for God's sake, Louella-
3 And Mr. Hearst has authorized me to tell you that you're looking at the most beautiful lawsuit in history if you release this picture. He'll bleed your little studio dry and you can all go on back to New York and do Shakespeare with the Boy Wonder.	Can I talk to Hearst?
4 You are talking to him.

1 "In Xanadu did Kubla Khan a stately pleasure dome decree. . . "How big is it, all told? The estate?	The whole joint is half the size of Rhode Island.
2 Jesus	Yeah, it's the place God would have built, if he'd had the money.

1 So, who is he? We have to know him.	Everyone sees someone different. That's what we show.
2 How?	Like a jewel. Turn it in the light and a different facet is illuminated.

1 Did I ever tell you about my father?	I don't give a shit about-
2 He was a drunk. And he was my father and I was ashamed of him.

1 You know, all this nightmare we went through with Hearst. The whole thing... And in the end, probably no one will ever remember the picture anyway.	Yeah, you're probably right.

1 "Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud.	Again

1 Listen to me. The press ban is killing us and the distributors won't book it. And meantime I'm dealing with the stockholders in New York who are scared shitless -- and I'm this far from getting fired myself -- and you don't have a friend in the world but me right now. So you have got to trust that I'll do what I can to--	"Do what you can"?! That's not good enough I
2 Well it' s all you've got !	You're with them, aren't you? You're going to bury my movie. They bought you!
3 For Christ's sake, shut up--	Why don't you just have the guts to admit it
4 How dare you talk to me like that! Do you think I'm like all the rest of those pirates?! Like Mayer and Warner? Is that what you think--?!	It's just that my movie is so-
5 "Your movie" -- I am so sick of that! It's your movie -- but it's his life! Did you ever think about that?! Did you ever think about that old man and Marion having to watch as you tore them apart?!

1 How 'bout a real drink?	We done?
2 Yeah.

1 Where you going at this hour?	What're you, a cop? I'm goin' out -- business.
2 You fuckin' worm, if you're going out, I'm going out.	And where you goin'?
3 None of your fuckin' business.

1 Who's that?	Whadda you care?
2 Whadda ya mean, whadda I care? Who is she? What's a matter? You afraid I'm gonna take her on you?	No, I'm not afraid. Why? You wanna meet her?
3 Yeah --	Cause I'll go right over there and bring her here.
4 Go 'head.	You sure you wanna meet her? Don't make me go over there, you change your mind and you make me look bad, cause she's really a knockout. She's 15, this kid -- a great piece of ass.
5 How do you know? You know her that good?	No, I see her around the pool. I know her. I know her like that -- not like that.
6 Nah, not now... I wanna wait. I don't feel right...

1 Excuse me for a minute. Be right back.	Don't be long. I'm afraid with all these tough guys here.

1 You givin' me that look. I gotta accept your word, but if I find out anythin', I'm gonna kill somebody...	So, go ahead. Kill everybody. Kill Salvy, kill Vickie, kill Tommy Como, kill me while you're at it. What do I care? You're killing yourself the way you're eating, the way you worry about things you don't have to worry about.
2 What do you mean, "you"?	What?
3 What do you mean, "you"?	I meant, kill everybody. You or me or anybody. You're a big shot. Kill, kill... g'head.
4 But you said "you."	So what?
5 Eh, Joey, even you don't know what you meant. You mentioned Salvy, Tommy Como, you -- that means somethin'. Why'd you say them? You coulda said anybody.	You're worried about this girl, you're gonna let this girl ruin you're life for you... You wanna worry, worry about your fuckin' stomach that you can't bend over -- that you gotta step in the ring in a month.
6 Did you ever fuck my wife?	What?
7 I don't mean now. I mean before -- before we met.	Whadda ya mean?
8 Did you ever fuck my wife?	Whatsa matter with you?
9 You're very smart, Joey, very smart. Nobody gives me a straight answer around here. You're givin' me these answers, but you still didn't answer my question. Did you fuck Vickie?	I gotta go. I gotta get outta here. I can't take this shit. Lenore is waitin' for me. I gotta go. You're a definite wacko. You're fuckin' crazy, you know that, crazy.

1 Joey said you wanted to meet me. Is that right? You wanted to meet me?	I just wanted to say hello.
2 You wanted to say hello, eh? I can't believe it. When did you fall outa heaven? Anyone ever tell you you're the most beautiful one here, princess of the pool. You got a baby face. Look at mine. Whatcha wanna meet me for?	I don't know. 'Cause you're cute.
3 Ya hear, Joey? She thinks this face is cute? Hey, whatcha doin' now? You wanna go for a ride?

1 Now take the rest off.	Jake, you made me promise not to get you excited.
2 Go 'head. Do it.

1 Where you been all day?	I took the kids to my sister's.
2 I called. You weren't there.	I got bored so I went to the movies.
3 What'd you see?	I went to the movies.
4 What'd you see?	"Father of the Bride."
5 What was it about?	Oh, c'mon. For Christsake, do I have to tell you everything?
6 Did you ever go to the Copa when I was away?	What're you talking about?
7 Answer me when I talk to you. What happened that night?	I am answering...
8 What do I have to do to get a straight answer around here.

1 I'm sorry. I had to work late last night. Slept at the club.	I'm leaving you Jake.
2 Sure, what else is new?	No. This time it's true. I didn't bother to tell you until I had everything worked out.

1 Hey, leave the kids alone.	Get lost.  Hey kids, "A cop is a rat." Remember that, "A rat."

1 Like disposing of their wives?	Get that idea out of your mind. It will only lead you in the wrong direction.

1 Feel a little foolish?	Not yet.

1 If I'd been careful piloting that reconnaissance plane, you wouldn't have taken the kind of pictures that got you a medal, a big job, fame, money --	All the things I hate.

1 Hello.	Did you get my note?

1 It's very simple. She belongs in that rarefied atmosphere of Park Avenue, expensive restaurants, and literary cocktail parties.	People with sense can belong wherever they're put.
2 Can you see her tramping around the world with a camera bum who never has more than a week's salary in the bank?  If only she was ordinary.

1 What about this morning? Any developments?	No. The shades are still drawn in their apartment.
2 In this heat?  They're up now.

1 Thank heaven that's over!	I have a feeling we've just begun.

1 What about the rest?	When those cops get a look at Miss Fremont -- they'll even contribute.

1 Big enough?	Fine. Corkscrew's on the right.

1 If you're saying all this just because you don't want to tell me the truth, because you're hiding something from me, then maybe I can understand --	There's nothing I'm hiding. It's just that --
2 It doesn't make sense to me. What's so different about it here from over there, or any place you go, that one person couldn't live in both places just as easily?	Some people can. Now if you'll let me explain --
3 What is it but traveling from one place to another, taking pictures? It's just like being a tourist on an endless vacation.	All right. That's your opinion. You're entitled to it, but --
4 It's ridiculous for you to say that it can only be done by a special, private little group of anointed people.

1 Don't you ever have any problems?	I have one now.
2 So do I.	Tell me about it.
3 Why would a man leave his apartment three times, on a rainy night, with a suitcase? And come back three times?	He likes the way his wife welcomes him home.
4 Not that salesman's wife. And why didn't he go to work today?	Homework. It's more interesting.
5 What's interesting about a butcher's knife and a small saw wrapped up in a newspaper?	Nothing, thank heaven.
6 Why hasn't he gone into his wife's bedroom all day?	I wouldn't dare answer that.
7 Lisa -- there's something terribly wrong.

1 Well, I guess it's safe to put on some lights now.	Not yet!

1 I'll trade you -- my feminine intuition for a bed for the night.	I'd be no better than Thorwald, to refuse.

1 Do you think this was worth waiting all day to see?	Is he cleaning house?
2 He's washing down the bathroom walls.

1 Steady Marlon!	Wanna make the colored lights go around and around?

1 You satisfied or you want more?	How 'bout you?  Say the word and you're cold, Jack--you're dead.

1 Tell him why we moved here.	Hold it, Jim.
2 You can't protect me.	You mind if I try?  You have to slam the door in my face?  I try to get to him--what happens?  Don't I give you everything you want?  A bicycle--you get a bicycle. A car--
3 You buy me many things.  Thank you.	Not just buy!  You hear all this talk about not lovely your kids enough.  We give you love and affection, don't we?

1 Well, just get it off your chest, son.	That's not what I mean.  I've never done anything right.  I've been going around with my head in a sling for years...I don't want to drag you into this but I can't help it.  I don't think I can prove anything by going around pretending I'm tough any more, so maybe you look like one thing but you still feel like another.
2 You're absolutely right!	Are you listening to me?  You're involved in this!  I want to go to the police and tell them I was mixed up in this thing tonight?
3 You what?

1 Luck, Jim.  Don't forget.	Have some cigars.
2 No thanks, I don't smoke.	Go on--Give 'em to your friends.
3 No--thanks, very much, Mr. Stark.

1 Who's there?  Anyone there?	Open it.

1 Excuse me--but--You know where I can find--I mean I don't remember his last name--	Look--can't you see I'm writing?

1 Are you really going to meet them?	Who knows.  Plato?
2 What?	What's a chickie-run?

1 Haven't you noticed your personality splitting?	Not lately.

1 No.	I promise nothing'll happen if you do.  You want my jacket?  It's warm.

1 'Bye, Mom.	Goodbye, dear.

1 Get lost.	Hang loose, boy.  I'm warning you.
2 Wash up and go home.	Big tough character.  You don't kid me, pal.  How come you're not wearing your boots?

1 Plato!	Just walk over here quietly now-- and there won't be any trouble.

1 Where you going?	I don't know, but we can't stay here.
2 Where can we go?  I can't go back into that zoo.	I'm never going back.
3 Listen!  I know a place!  PLATO showed me before.  An old deserted mansion near the planetarium  Would you go with me?

1 Is this what it's like to love somebody?	You disappointed?
2 Funny Jimmy.  You're so clean and you--this is silly.	What?
3 You smell like baby powder.	So do you.
4 I never felt so clean before.	It's not going to be lonely, Judy. Not for you and not for me.
5 I love somebody.  All the time I've been looking for someone to love me and now--I love somebody.  And it's so easy.  Why is it easy now?	It is for me too.
6 I love you, Jim.  I really mean it.

1 Judy--we're ready for you now.	He hates me.
2 What?	He hates me.

1 I guess I just don't understand anything.	I'm tired, Judy.  I'd like to change the subject.
2 Why?	I'd like to, that's all.  Girls your age don't do that.  You need an explanation?
3 Girls don't love their father? Since when?  Since I got to be sixteen?

1 He wants... your "sister"...	...whoever she is.

1 Thought you wrote you had a mustache.	I can get another one going. Y'know, hey, whatever you want me to --
2 No, no, no. Be like you want to be.

1 You forget where I work?	Beauty and fragrances.
2 Fifty percent off, motherfucker. Ho ho ho.

1 Get the hell off of me!	Nick, it won't work. It won't work!

1 Get your own room, Ashley.	Nick...
2 Get your own room.

1 I'm going to have to be inside that casino. When it happens. I'll need to be part of it. I can't just be drawing some map.	Nick, what are you talking about?
2 We need to find a way to make me part of it.	Part of... with them?

1 You said Merry Christmas, Rudy.	I... you told me your name was Rudy. You told me a million times, back in the truck, telling me you weren't Nick --
2 No --	You were screaming you weren't Nick! And we just didn't fucking believe you!
3 But I never said Rudy.	You said it a million times!
4 I never told you my name.

1 You knew the place --	Hey.

1 Rather be back in the Mountain?	Might as well be.
2 Don't have Weather Channel in the Mountain, Nick.

1 He thought I was some gambler... he didn't know me... he didn't recognize me!	I been driving rigs a long time, Nick. Four, five million miles of road. Worked for people who wouldn't keep me on less I was driving fifteen hours a day. Tell 'em I needed sleep, I needed rest, shit, they'll hire someone else...

1 Can't be attracting attention, right?	What, we walking in there and delivering toys?

1 He won't tell us where it is. The Powwow Safe.	I don't know... what you're...

1 Goddamn, Merlin. There any part of the day you don't smoke?	There anytime you don't got a mouthful of shit?
2 Cancer-sucker.	Acid-chewer.

1 What the hell was that about --	He didn't recognize me. Back off, willya? He didn't recognize me.

1 She's gonna be out there, man. Right there. Right there waiting.	Yeah.
2 Gonna walk out of this shitstorm and right into her arms.	Yeah.
3 Got us a motel out Highway 5, bringing her own damn sheets, you read that part? Silk damn sheets. Lock ourselves in the whole week, drinking wine, taking baths, man, see if they got those room service steaks... anything I want to do. Remember when she wrote that? Anything I want...	Yeah. Fuckin' Christmas.

1 Don't move, Rudy!	Standing right here, man!

1 Switch seats with me.	What? No...
2 You're taking my money. Switch seats with me. Switch seats with me if you're not taking my money --	I'm ninety-two years old --
3 Then get yourself another table! You're hitting Santa's cards and you're taking Santa's money!	There is no other table --
4 THEY'LL OPEN ONE!

1 Seymour Scagnetti.	Scagnetti? Oh shit, I hear he's a motherfucker.
2 He is a motherfucker. He won't let me leave the halfway house till I get some piece of shit job.	You're coming back to work for us, right?
3 I wanna. But I gotta show this asshole I got an honest-to-goodness job before he'll let me move out on my own. I can't work for you guys and be worried about gettin' back before ten o'clock curfew.

1 Now Vic was tellin' me, he's got a parole problem.	Really? Who's your P.O.?

1 The black Beverly Hills. I knew this lady from Ladora Heights once.  "Hi, I'm from Ladora Heights, it's the black Beverly Hills."	It's not the black Beverly Hills, it's the black Palos Verdes. Anyway, this chick, Elois, was a man-eater- upper. I bet every guy who's ever met her has jacked off to her at least once. You know who she looked like? Christie Love. 'Member that TV show "Get Christie Love"? She was a black female cop. She always used to say "You're under arrest, sugar."
2 I was in the sixth grade when that show was on. I totally dug it. What the fuck was the name of the chick who played Christie Love?	Pam Grier.
3 No, it wasn't Pam Grier, Pam Grier was the other one. Pam Grier made the movies. Christie Love was like a Pam Grier TV show, without Pam Grier.	What the fuck was that chick's name? Oh this is just great, I'm totally fuckin' tortured now.
4 Well, whoever she was, Elois looked like her. So one night I walk into the club, and no Elois. Now the bartender was a wetback, he was a friend of mine, his name was Carlos. So I asked him "Hey, Carlos, where's Lady E tonight?" Well apparently Lady E was married to this real piece of dog shit. I mean a real animal. And apparently he would so things to her.

1 Let's go over it. Where are you?	I stand outside and guard the door. I don't let anybody come in or go out.
2 Mr. Brown?	Mr. Brown stays in the car. He's parked across the street till I give him the signal, then he pulls up in front of the store.
3 Mr. Blonde and Mr. Blue?	Crowd control. They handle customers and employees in the display area.

1 Then one day she meets a John Holmes motherfucker, and it's like, whoa baby. This mother fucker's like Charles Bronson in "The Great Escape." He's diggin' tunnels. Now she's gettin' this serious dick action, she's feelin' something she ain't felt since forever. Pain.	Chew? Toby Chew? No.
2 It hurts. It hurts her. It shouldn't hurt. Her pussy should be Bubble-Yum by now. But when this cat fucks her, it hurts. It hurts like the first time. The pain is reminding a fuck machine what is was like to be a virgin. Hence, "Like a Virgin."

1 No, she did it. She killed the cheatin' wife, too.	Who gives a damn?

1 Aren't you?	I don't have the slightest fuckin' idea what you're talkin' about.

1 I told 'em not to touch the alarm. They touched it. I blew 'em full of holes. If they hadn't done what I told 'em not it, they'd still be alive.	That's your excuse for going on a kill crazy rampage?
2 I don't like alarms.

1 I don't even know a Jew who'd have the balls to say that. So let's get this straight. You never ever tip?	I don't tip because society says I gotta. I tip when somebody deserves a tip. When somebody really puts forth an effort, they deserve a little something extra. But this tipping automatically, that shit's for the birds. As far as I'm concerned, they're just doin' their job.

1 I gotta take a squirt, where's the commode in this dungeon?	Go down the hall, turn left, up those stairs, then turn right.

1 Both of you two assholes knock it the fuck off and calm down!	So you wanna git bit, huh?
2 Cut the bullshit, we ain't on a fuckin' playground!  I don't believe this shit, both of you got ten years on me, and I'm the only one actin like a professional. You guys act like a bunch of fuckin' niggers. You ever work a job with a bunch of niggers? They're just like you two, always fightin', always sayin' they're gonna kill one another.	You said yourself, you thought about takin' him out.
3 Then. That time has passed. Right now, Mr. Blonde is the only one I completely trust. He's too fuckin' homicidal to be workin' with the cops.	You takin' his side?
4 Fuck sides! What we need is a little solidarity here. Somebody's stickin' a red hot poker up our asses and we gotta find out whose hand's on the handle. Now I know I'm no piece of shit...  And I'm pretty sure you're a good boy...  And I'm fuckin positive you're on the level. So let's figure out who's the bad guy.

1 You don't know how good it is to see you.	Maybe you won't feel that way after I tell you what I stopped in for.

1 What's the matter with her?	Too much excitement. Or maybe it's just the heat. How about the surrey. Can you fix it?

1 Learnin' to read has nothing to do with the right or the wrong side of the street.	Are the horses stragglin' or aren't they?
2 They're stragglin'.	His letters will keep.

1 Better go on back and get some more sleep. You'll need it later on.	You're not going out to look for them?
2 No, I'm not. All I want 'em to do is keep ahead of us -- a long way ahead. So I'm riding up the line aways to pick us out a new trail.

1 All my clothes --	That's right -- worry about your clothes --

1 Where you going?	To the other side of the street.

1 Who's Lednov?	A man I used to know.

1 Where'd they go?	Swimming.

1 Come on. We got a couple hours to eat and get some sleep.	I'll eat when I'm good and ready.
2 Kind of feeling your oats this morning. I haven't laid a hand on you for quite a while, but that doesn't mean you're too old.	What makes you think you're so almighty? Telling people what to do and how to act when you don't even know how yourself.

1 Yeah, how did you know?	The whole state's lookin' for 'em.  And they're lookin' for me.

1 She mustn't -- don't you let her --	There, there. Don't you upset yourself --
2 If she says anything to them I'll kill her.

1 Suppose I take a look.	Go ahead.

1 I tried my best, but these things take time.	And we're running out of that.
2 There's still tomorrow morning.

1 How do you know who we are?	Everybody knows --
2 Who brought you here?

1 Pleased to meet you, ma'am.  We found your trunk. Were you doin' the driven'?	I was at first. Then I was hanging on.  Are you going far?

1 And that's tough, isn't it?	Without someone to teach you, it's tough.

1 For the last ten miles I've been trying to figure out how to sleep sitting up. I'm getting to the point where I don't think there's any place named Sonora.	It's a long ways yet.  I figure we ought to camp. She's tired.

1 And remember that trip we took to Africa? That safari was so wonderful. Me, you... best of friends... forever.	Uh, Alex, we've only know each other one day.
2 Oh... I guess I'll die now.	Okay... maybe that would be best.

1 Cindy, what's going on?	It's Hanson, he's evil. Let's get him!

1 But, hey, maybe we can be friends.	Sure, that would be cool. Friends.
2 Okay. See you later, friend.

1 Cindy, I've been thinking about this whole friend thing. I never had a friend that cares for me the way you do... I mean, there's Ray, but he cares for me in a different way. You know, bringing me flowers. Running my bath water. And then there's nights I wake up screaming and I look over and Ray's in my bed. Holding me. And seeing that tonight might be our last night together, I was thinking...	That we should take our friendship a little further?
2 Yes...	Oh, Buddy, I was thinking the same thing. It might be our last night in this house. And I think we should take full advantage of it.
3 I was thinking the same thing.

1 Stop it! I'm just trying to say I think we should take our friendship to the next level.	Oh.
2 I don't want to be your friend like this anymore.	Then what are we going to do?
3 You know, walking on the beach, holding hands, kissing, making love...	That sounds kinda gay, but since you're a guy, I guess it's okay.
4 Let's get a hot dog.

1 How about these buns?	Yeah, they're so warm and soft.

1 Tell me, Cindy. Would you ever tell me "Stop. If you loved me you'd stop."	Not in a thousand years.

1 Father!	My child, you're alive!
2 Yes, we made it!	We? What do you mean... we?
3 Me and my friends... You see there was this ghost. He came out of nowhere and....	My child you are the only survivor.
4 No, my friends are right here!

1 Hey, y'all! What's going on?	Shorty! You're alive!! But... what about your head?
2 That turned out to be a good thing! It's gonna make smuggling a whole lot easier. Remember that weed? I'm about to get paid.

1 I take it you're not mad at me.	I wouldn't go that far.

1 I have taken care of everything, including medical supplies and blood storage. We want to be safe.	Right. What about condoms?
2 Professor!	Hey, you're the one who brought up safety. I'm perfectly willing to go in raw.
3 Would you please focus?	Fine.  What's all this stuff?
4 Well, this measures the amount of thermal imbalance within a room down to the tiniest molecular disturbances.

1 I can do it myself.	Yeah, I can see that. Later I want you to teach me that trick, but right now we have a job to do.
2 The keys. She took the keys.

1 It's the best seat in the house. I warmed it up for you.	Second best.

1 Remember, don't ask her too many questions.	Because she will lie?
2 No, because her breath smells like a horse's ass.

1 "Ray!"	"Fucked me."
2 "Ray!"	"Fucked me."

1 Bring her home... I guess.	No more violence... No more violence...

1 You'd probably date him!  He's cu-uuute! Hey, Dad, did you ever see "Henry, Portrait of a Serial Killer?"	I certainly did not.

1 You kids. Now Birdie, I want you to have a cookie and then run along home.	But Mom, the video's not over.
2 No "but mom" for you, young man. Mr. Stubbins seems to think these silly movies are interfering with your studies. 

1 Detectives, what is this about?	I know this sounds weird, Mr. Sutphin, but the Department of Motor Vehicle's computer shows only one blue station wagon registered to a parent of any of Mr. Stubbins' pupils.
2 Surely you don't think Beverly was involved!

1 Look at this!  "Hillside Strangler gets his college degree in prison!"	That's nice.
2 Nice?! He should have been executed!

1 Let's say grace and pray that we have the strength to understand the terrible tragedies of the last few days.	Amen to that.  It's been a crazy day, hasn't it?!

1 Hello.	Is this the Cocksucker residence?
2 Goddamn you! STOP CALLING HERE!	Isn't this 4215 Pussy Way?
3 You bitch!	Let me check the zip - 212 Fuck you?
4 The police are tracing your call right this minute.	Well, Dottie, how come they're not here then, Fuck-Face?
5 FUCK YOU! 

1 So you do drink?	Socially... I'll have a beer.
2 So you admit you just lied?

1 I'm stoodup! I'll kill that bastard!	Don't say words unless you mean them, Misty. 

1 Mrs. Ackerman, when you left me at the flea-market, where did you go?	...Browsing.
2 Did Carl Padgett buy something you wanted?	I didn't want that Faberge egg - it was chipped!
3 Carl Padgett died for the Franklin Mint, didn't he?!	NO! I could never hurt anyone!

1 What was that?	I didn't hear anything. Got any dessert?
2 Dr. Sutphin said no sweets for you.	What's he know?
3 How to send a bill!!

1 We can't stand here all night.	You could go and open the door.
2 Listen 

1 How much does she want?	She could use a hundred dollars.
2 I'll give you a check.	She can only use cash.

1 What did she want?	I did her hair.
2 What were you talking about?	Nothing.
3 Nothing! That's absurd. I heard you laughing and talking, She was asking questions.	She was just asking about you - Whether it was nice to work for you or not.
4 And that was all?	No. She asked about the trademark.
5 What did she want to know?	She showed me a drawing.
6 You fool! That symbol is us -- us. She was asking about us.

1 What brought you down here, Greg?	Oh, I had business with a man... but I missed him -
2 Well, I'm glad you came to see me.

1 I've never loved any one before, Gregory, and I do love you - you must know it -- but Jacqueline's my sister  whom I had lost and have found again....   	I know  I shouldn't have told you
2 No, I'm glad....at least I've heard you say it...

1 Who are you?	I'm Mimi -- I'm dying.
2 No!	Yes. It's been quiet, oh ever so quiet. I hardly move, yet it keeps coming all the time -closer and closer. I rest and rest and yet I am dying.
3 And you don't want to die. I've always wanted to die -- always.	I'm afraid.

1 Look. I'm serious. It's a real and vary earnest society -- a dangerous society...	I can imagine.
2 Some time before those nice white gloves are dry you're going to go and find out a few things about Mrs. Redi.

1 Ah, my Jason -- always laughing -- always trying to help others.  He's a good boy, Miss -- he just talks that way.	I'm a good boy, but no one listens to what I say.

1 What was she to you?	I don't think that you would understand if I told you.
2 I think I understand without your telling me. I know something of your history, Jason. I know that you haven't written for ten years.	I've lost my knack.
3 After that wonderful first book - after all the adulation and the good reviews?

1 If you like, I'll go with you to dinner.	I'd like that.

1 I was a great dancer...	A strange collection. You're like the false god you worship... fallen angels, all of you.
2 Life has betrayed us. We've found there is no heaven on earth, so we must worship evil for evil's own sake. We're not wicked. We commit no violence, unless...	Unless what?
3 No, you draw no secrets from me, as you drew them from Jacqueline. You are not one of us yet. You're clever, Louis, but I recognize your interest in me for what it is worth. You are only curious. You have never loved a woman who had but one arm.	It would be a charming experience. She might only protest half as much.
4 You're very flippant and perhaps wise, but not wise enough to see the truth, Louis.

1 If I were you, Mary -- I'd go back to school. I'd make no further attempt to find Jacqueline.	Why?
2 It will make you unhappy to find Jacqueline. It would put her in danger --- great danger --

1 Fo come ti pare. To desiderare sempre di vedere che cosa c'era in quella stanza.	What did he say?

1 Jacqueline, you have spoken so often of ending it all, I can't understand why this should be so difficult for you. You have only to drink a little.	Yes, Jacqueline. You were always talking suicide - - of ending your life when you wanted to.

1 Why'd you drop out?	Oh, lots of reasons, most of them boring. But, up until I dropped out, John and I were... very much alike.
2 That's hard to believe. The two of you seem so different.	I would imagine that we are, now. I think I'm ready to use the bathroom, finally.

1 Do you understand what I'm trying to say?	I think so. I remember reading somewhere that men learn to love what they're attracted to, whereas women become more and more attracted to the person they love.
2 Yes! Yes! I think that's very true. Very.

1 Because I enjoy interviewing women more than men.	All of these are interviews?
2 Yes.	Can we look at one?
3 No.	Why not?
4 Because I promised each subject that no one would look at the tape except me.

1 You don't know what I'm thinking.	It's a simple question. Have you ever thought of having -- making love with someone other than your husband?

1 You're really never going to make love again?	I'm not planning on it.

1 That's the first thing that ran through my mind when I saw you. I thought this is not the same man that rode the unicycle naked through the homecoming parade.	You did that?

1 Where did you go when you left here?	I drove around. Then I went to talk with Graham.

1 Are you afraid of his reaction? Of his finding you silly for thinking of such things?	No. I don't know. I haven't told him about the garbage thing because I'm pissed off at him right now. He's letting some old college buddy stay at our house for a couple of days, and he didn't even ask me about it. I mean, I would've said yes, I just wish he would've asked.
2 What upsets you about that?	I guess I'm upset because I can't really justify being upset, I mean, it's his house, really, he pays the mortgage.
3 But he asked you to quit your job, and you do have housework.	Yeah, I know.
4 This unexpected visit notwithstanding, how are things with John?	Fine, I guess. Except right now I'm going through this where I don't want him to touch me.

1 Is he? Strange, I mean?	Not really. Maybe if I just saw him on the street I'd have said that, but after talking to him... he's just kind of... I don't know, unusual.
2 Uh-huh. So what's he look like?	Why?
3 I just want to know what he looks like, is all.	Why, so you can go after him?
4 Jesus, Ann, get a life. I just asked what he looked like.

1 So what's my share of the dress?	Thirty-two dollars.

1 Oh, okay. I think I get it.	What do you get?
2 Well, they must be something sexual, because Ann gets freaked out by that shit. Are these tapes of you having sex with these girls or something?	Not exactly.
3 Well, either you are or you aren't. Which is it?	Why don't you let me tape you?
4 Doing what?	Talking.
5 About what?	Sex. Your sexual history, your sexual preferences.
6 What makes you think I'd discuss that with you?	Nothing.
7 You just want to ask me questions?	I just want to ask you questions.
8 And that's all?	That's all.
9 Is this how you get off or something? Taping women talking about their sexual experiences?	Yes.
10 Would anybody else see the tape?	Absolutely not. They are for my private use only.
11 How do we start?	I turn on the camera. You start talking.
12 And you ask questions, right?	Yes.
13 How long will it take?	That depends on you. One woman only used three minutes. Another filled up three two hour tapes.
14 Can I see some of the other tapes to get an idea of what --	No.
15 Do I sit or stand?	Whichever you prefer.
16 I'd rather sit. Are you ready?	Just a moment.

1 I wish you'd quit that bartending job.	Why?
2 I hate the thought of guys hitting on you all the time.	I can handle it. Besides, the money is good and some of the guys are cute. And you are in no position to be jealous.
3 Who said I was jealous?	I did.

1 I felt like it, so what? Goddam, you and Ann make such a big deal out of it.	You told Ann about this?
2 Of course. She is my sister. I tell her almost everything.	I wish you hadn't done that.
3 Why not?	It's just something I'd prefer she didn't know about.
4 She's a grown-up, she can handle it.	I just... Ann is very...
5 Hung up.	It just wasn't a smart thing to do. Did you sign any sort of paper, or did he have any contract with you saying he wouldn't broadcast these tapes?
6 No.	You realize you have no recourse legally? This stuff could show up anywhere.
7 It won't. I trust him.	You trust him.
8 Yeah, I do. A helluva lot more than I trust you.	What do you mean?
9 Exactly what I said. I'd trust him before I'd trust you. How much clearer can I be?	It hurts that you would say that to me.
10 Oh, please. Come on, John. You're fucking your wife's sister and you hardly been married a year. You're a liar. But at least I know you're a liar. It's the people that don't know, like Ann, that have to watch out.	By definition you're lying to Ann, too.
11 That's right. But I never took a vow in front of God and everybody to be "faithful" to my sister.	Look, are we going to do it or not?
12 Actually, no, I've changed my mind. I shouldn't have called.	Well, I'm here now. I'd like to do something...
13 How about straightening up the living room?

1 Give me your keys.	My keys?

1 C'mon, let's smoke one of the cigarettes right now. Your father'll never miss it.	I can't, dummy. He'll see that the pack's been opened. You're such a dumbhead.
2 OK, then. I'm gonna go back to the store and buy my own pack and smoke 'em all myself.	Buy 'em with what, dumbhead?
3 With some milk jugs I just happened to pick up on the way home.

1 Roger? If you're going to be staying here anyway, why don't you come up to my place for a late supper?	Meeting Rollo at Tudor's. Might take a while.
2 Doesn't matter to me how late it is. I can keep it warm.

1 What happened?	Please pardon me. I am Niccolo Spergazzi. I am a resident here. I don't know... we were walking in the hallway and... Cabiria... my wife... she was attacked by this thing... here, on her arm.

1 Right. It's crazy. But here's the beauty part. Ready?  Who cares?	I don't get it.
2 You know and I know that Hobbes was a lousy teacher, eh? Lousy. Dry, academic, afraid of women, lousy. But he was always a genius at one thing -- getting grants. Could he get grants for crazy projects?

1 BREAKING OUT	BREAKING OUT
2 BREAKING OUT	BREAKING OUT
3 BREAKING OUT	BREAKING OUT

1 We've been hearing some bad things about you, Brad.	He needs help.

1 How did you come by this scenario?	I am in Farley's employ -- and...  ...we're discussing a network deal.
2 Why Janet?	Everyone loves the girl next door, particularly Farley.
3 So it seems.

1 McKinley?...McKinley?	Bert brought them over from Europe.  They had a very popular series together.  It's still rerun in a lot of countries.  You must have seen them in 'Dentonvale?'

1 SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR ENSLAVEMENT	SOME PEOPLE DO IT ON THE PAVEMENT

1 SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR EACH OTHER	SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR THEIR LOVERS
2 SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR IMPROVEMENT	SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR MOVEMENT
3 SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR ENJOYMENT	SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR EMPLOYMENT

1 It's only one night, Janet. Let's not forget who we're doing this for?	Who?

1 No!  He's never done that before.	Good!  Well there's still hope. Lots of hope.

1 Let's hear the five 'F's' for today.  F for...	Farley!
2 F for...	Flavors!
3 F for...	Fabulous!
4 F for...	Fast!
5 F for...	Foods!

1 WHAT A JOKE...	WHAT A JOKE...
2 YOU FEL LIKE CHOKING YOU PLAY FOR BROKE...	YOU PLAY FOR BROKE...
3 HE LEAVES YOU SMOKING...	OH ROMANCE IS NOT A CHILDREN'S GAME...
4 YOU KEEP GOING BACK IT'S DRIVING YOU INSANE

1 Nice technique there...  ...Cammi.	It's all in the wrist.  You know, you look really familiar. You from around here? Where'd you go to high school?
2 No, we're from San Diego. Why?	I don't know. You just seem really familiar to me. Never mind. Enjoy your meals.
3 Hang on. Did you ever know a Derek Sommersby?	Doctor Derek Sommersby? You mean from "One Life to Live"?

1 Miles.	Hey, Evelyn, it's your favorite client.
2 How's the trip?	Good, good. Drinking some good wines and kicking back, you know. So what's happening? Still no word?
3 Actually there is word. I spoke to Keith Kurtzman this morning.	And?
4 And... they're passing. Conundrum's passing. He said they really liked it. They really wanted to do it, but they just couldn't figure out how to market it. He said it was a tough call.	Huh.
5 I'm sorry, Miles.  So I don't know where that leaves us. I'm not sure how much more mileage I can get out of continuing to submit it. I think it's one of those unfortunate cases in the business right now -- a fabulous book with no home. The whole industry's gotten gutless. It's not about the quality of the books. It's about the marketing.

1 Two years ago, buddy.	You should get back together with Victoria. She was good for you.

1 I can explain.	You said you loved me! You fuck! I hope you die!

1 Oh, that's tasty.	100% Pinot Noir. Single vineyard. They don't even make it anymore.
2 Pinot Noir? How come it's white? Doesn't noir mean dark?	Jesus. Don't ask questions like that up in the wine country. They'll think you're a moron.
3 Just tell me.	Color in the red wines comes from the skins. This juice is free run, so there's no skin contact in the fermentation, ergo no color.
4 Sure is tasty.

1 Hey, Miles. I really hope your novel sells.	Thanks, Jack. So do I.  Here we are.

1 Are you chewing gum?	Want some?

1 Have you no shame?	Oooh. Oh. Miles. Miles.
2 Fuck you.

1 You know how often these pourers get hit on?  I'm going for a swim. Get the blood flowing. Want to come?	Nah. I want to watch this.

1 Later.	Yeah, well, maybe you should check your messages first.

1 Listen, I'm going to make sure Steph and Siena get home safe, and then maybe we'll hook up with you later, okay?	Sure, whatever. Maybe I'll catch a movie.

1 Fucker hit into us.	Hey, asshole! That's not cool!
2 Throw me his ball.

1 Do you like them?	Yeah, they're great. Sporty. They're really sporty.
2 Are they too sporty?

1 She gets off in an hour, so I think I'm just going to have a drink and then... make sure she gets home safe.	You're joking, right?  What are you doing? Un-fucking- believeable. Can we just go back to the hotel and hang out and get up early and play nine holes before we head home?

1 What's wrong?	Nothing. Buckle up, okay?

1 Yeah, I know what you mean. It's a long drive up here. Where're you staying?	The Windmill.

1 Wow. We gotta give it a moment, but this is tasty. Really good. How about you?	I think they overdid it a bit. Too much alcohol. Overwhelms the fruit.
2 Yeah, I'd say you're right on the money.

1 You guys should stop by the restaurant for lunch today.	Great. What's the latest we can get there?
2 About two-thirty.	Okay.
3 Did you hear about this Bordeaux tasting dinner down in Santa Barbara Saturday night? It's a little pricey, but if you wanted to go, I'd be into it. Why don't you stay through the weekend?

1 Where are you?	A little place in Los Olivos. New owners. Cozy ambiance. Excellent food too -- you should try it. Thought of you at the Hitching Post last night.

1 Cabernet Franc.  This is only the fifth year we've made this varietal. Very few wineries around here do a straight Cabernet Franc. It's from our vineyard up in Santa Maria. And it was a Silver Medal winner at Paso Robles last year.	Well, I've come to never expect greatness from a Cab Franc, and this one's no exception. Sort of a flabby, overripe --

1 A famous actor who's getting married next week.	Oh, that's right. Isn't that nice? I hope that girls knows how lucky she is, marrying no less than Derek Summersby.

1 There's dust in it.	This one?
2 A hair.	This one?
3 Morgan took a sip. It has his amoebas in it.

1 Hi sweetie.	Hi baby.

1 I cursed.	I heard.

1 Do you feel comforted?	Yes.
2 What does it matter then?

1 He was only a year and half old.	What are you doing?
2 He was trying to eat a second chocolate bar. Your grandma said, "No." He tried to take a bite, so I grabbed it.

1 He's not strong enough to fight off another attack.	I know.  We need to be sure, before we open that door Graham.

1 So the aliens can't read our minds.	Oh.
2 They tell you everything in this book.

1 Stop crying!	Don't yell at her!

1 I don't think so.	Do you owe anybody money? You can tell me off the record if you need too.
2 No.

1 They think these look like stages immediately proceeding an attack maneuver.	It's like War of the Worlds.
2 They think it might happen all at once.

1 Well, no, not exactly. See then his friend opened up on me.	What friend is that?
2 The one with the shotgun.

1 Maybe we'll see you sometime.	Yeah... maybe. So long.

1 More than enough.	Have you thought at all about your plans?
2 Some. I've been talking to the Parkers. One thing I know I'm not doing -- I'm not going back.

1 Hobart, what are you people doing here?	This is where Baxter and Hawley brung us.
2 Well, they're wrong. This territory is full of bad characters.	And they were two of them. Look --

1 What's Turley like?	It's a town...
2 They got a saloon there?	I expect.
3 Women?	I expect.

1 I'll see you around.	Last one to the Midnight Star buys.

1 It was not -- it was Murdo's. Those McKendricks don't know how to act like human beings.	His son is worse than he was. He's smoother, so you don't always hear him coming, but he'll do anything to keep his range free.
2 I'm worried what he's going to do when he finds out you boys are back.

1 What are you talking about?	I'm done talking. Get out.
2 You can't do this.	Really?

1 Why him?	Shut up. You need help, don't you?

1 This is mighty sweet, Paden. I think I finally found my place in the world.	Well I'm real happy for you, Cobb. But I think I'll keep looking for mine.

1 What a waste. This could have been such a sweet deal for us.	Yeah. Bad luck.  Good-bye, Cobb.
2 Good-bye, Paden.

1 Where's the dog now?	He left me.

1 But not everyone's imaginary, are they, Mr. Taransky?  I refer, of course, to Edith.	Who?

1 You're not renewing my contract.	How can I?  Your last three pictures tanked.  The board is giving me hell.  No bankable star will work with you after this.  If you just compromised... a little.

1 I got them to remove the reflection.  The mirror's metaphor -- to show how her character's inwardly dead.	That's genius, Viktor.  Was that Simone's idea?
2 Who else?  It's always Simone's idea.

1 Viktor, do you realize you always do that?	Do what?
2 Whenever I compliment Simone, you take the credit.	I do?
3 Yes, you do...  Anyway, tonight was a good start.	Excuse me?  Start?
4 It's a crowded summer.  We need every photo-opp, sound-byte and column inch we can get.  Good night, Viktor.

1 I was thinking -- what about you and... "Simone" moving back in with me and Lainey?	That sounds wonderful.  How do you feel about all this, Lainey?

1 Thank God for you, Faith.  I know this is above and beyond the call of duty for a stand-in.  You don't know what a service you're performing for Simone -- shielding her from those animals.	No, thank God for you, Mr. Taransky.  How many men would go to so much trouble to protect a woman?

1 Nicola Anders is the only actress who can play that role.	It's a re-make, Hal.  Anders is not bigger than this picture.

1 You have to see her.	I've seen them all before.
2 Not like this --	Come on, Hank.  A synthespian, virtual actor -- ?
3 -- We call them "vactors".	I need flesh and --
4 -- Flesh is weak.	-- a living, breathing actor -- I can't work with a fake.

1 Can't you stop that?	Why?
2 Those things can be dangerous. Staring at a screen all day -- you miss what's going on outside in the real world.  You can lose yourself. You should get out more.  How are you going to meet boys?	I know plenty of boys.
3 Really?  Who?  Where do you meet them?  In a chat room?  How do you know he's not some middle-aged freak?	Dad, I can spot a middle-aged freak a mile away.
4 Okay.  But you have to find a way to escape that thing.	I do.
5 How?	I read.
6 You do?  Still?  I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that.	You were the one who insisted on it.  Reading me Dostoyevsky and Joyce when I was four.
7 You understood them.  That's what was amazing.  It's a nice day.  Let's eat outside.

1 -- I can't accept it.  I don't want a car, Dad.	Why not?  I can get you something else.  What do you want?
2 The old Viktor Taransky.  I liked you better before -- before all this.  You were a loser, Dad, but at least you had integrity.  I can't stand to see you like this -- clinging to Simone's coattails -- it used to be about the work, and now it's all about her.  And then she's not even grateful enough to thank you.	No, that was me.
3 There you go again, blaming yourself.  Can't you see what she's done to you -- she's taking advantage, mocking you.  You deserve better than Simone.  I've got to go, Dad.	Lainey...

1 What is it exactly you want, Sayer?	I want to see her.  Unless you show me Simone live and in person I show these pictures to the authorities.

1 Am I wasting my time with you? When she sues to protect her privacy, she'll have to appear in a public courtroom to do it.	Long live the First Amendment.
2 Sometimes you have to tell a small lie to get to the bigger truth.  As for a photo -- if you can't do it, I know twelve million people who can.

1 No one came in or went out just like you said, Mr. Taransky.	Good.
2 Is Miss Simone coming today?	She's already here.  She arrived before you and she'll leave long after you've gone.  Remember, under no circumstances are you or any other person to enter the set without my express permission.
3 What if it catches on fire?	Let it burn.  Simone would rather go up in flames than give up her privacy.

1 See beyond that irrational allegiance to flesh and blood. -- See that with the rise in price of a real actor and the fall in price of a fake, the scales have tipped in favor of the fake.  -- See that if the performance is genuine, it doesn't matter if the actor is real.  Once a performance is committed to film, the blood and bones are gone anyway.  Only the spirit, the illusion remains. Besides, what's real anymore? These days most actors have digital work done to them so it's a gray area.	Are you ever going to tell the truth about me, Mr. Taransky?
2 The only real truth is in the work.	You know what I'm talking about.
3 Yes.  Yes, I'm going to tell the truth about you, why wouldn't I...?  Of course, with Hank's tragic passing, the secret died with him.  I am going to tell the truth... after your next picture.

1 Goodnight, Malcolm.	Goodnight, sweetheart.

1 I'm going to see you again, right?	If it's okay with you?

1 You said the "s" word.	Yeah. Sorry.

1 I don't know how the story ends. I hope it's a happy ending.	Me too.

1 --What?	Don't give up. You're the only one who can help me. I know it.

1 I wish I were somewhere else.	Where will you go, where no one has died?

1 Communicate?	Tell you my secrets.

1 She wanted me to tell you--	Cole, please stop.
2 She wanted me to tell you, she saw you dance.

1 Stuttering Stanley!	S-ssstop that!
2 Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley!	S-ssssstop it!
3 Stuttering--	--Shhhhhhut upppp you fffffffreak!

1 Yo. "Billy Bob". Was I two beats behind, or what?	Nope.
2 See?	You were a beat and a quarter behind.
3 Fuck you! If you're such an expert on music, why don't you go get your dueling banjo and sit in on the next song?	I ain't never played a banjo in my life.

1 Aha. The Lovers.	Not lately.

1 Thought your boy and his band were only staying the night.	Bus broke down.

1 You're out of your mind, man.	I am not! I'm telling you, it's worth its weight in gold.
2 Let me get this straight... we're talking about manure?

1 Carl! Oh Carrrrl!	Come out, come out wherever you are!

1 You'll be back.	I don't think so.

1 Jesus. What a bunch of useless zombies.	Who? Us?!
2 The audience!

1 Try taking a left after the next cow pasture.	Yeah. That sounds good. "Hang a left at the first cow patty, then make a right when you see porky pig".

1 Think of it... as a threesome. You. Me. And... "Jethro."	I said that's enough!

1 Get out of here.	No. Not without you --

1 Where's Mac?	Who knows? Just like a man... never around when you need them.

1 Don't worry. The lurker ain't around. I checked.	That's not funny.
2 Sorry.	Whatcha' doin'?
3 Tryin' to get a buzz on. But I'm too buff. Too much muscle mass.

1 No reception out here.	Bill, I'll run out to your car, call for paramedics from there.

1 What's she see in that douchebag?	That's the mystery of the ages there, Trev. Starla was seventeen when they got engaged. He was, like, in his thirties. No one even knew they were goin' out till she had that ring on her finger.

1 Rorschach.	What do you see? I see a butterfly.

1 You're lookin' awful pretty.	Shut up.

1 Where are you going?	I'm just some big clown to you, ain't I?
2 That's not true -- Where are you--?	Out.

1 Now he's here. He went in Mr. Grant.	Through a wound on his stomach?

1 What's he get if he wins here?	If...?

1 So tell me about yourself.	Okay.

1 Well?	We lost him.

1 Mississippi's the other way!	You want to lose this putz or not?!?

1 My very words.	Well, that's what you get for falling in love with a guy who's first name is Ramblin'.

1 What are you thinking?	You gotta admire the man's determination.

1 Twenty-eight hours! You're outta your gord.	Is that any way to talk to your ole partner?  Look, it's only nine hundred miles each way.
2 That means we gotta average ninety- four miles per.  Forget it.	No one's ever done it before. This'll put us on the map.
3 Or in the slammer.	Did I tell you they're gonna give us a brand new Kenworth?
4 Waynette!

1 Liquid gold.	Redneck heaven.

1 I hope that's you, buddy; 'cause I'd hate to start believing in ghosts.	What does the old Timex say?
2 She's losing minutes so you better start running interference or we're never gonna make it. Might I remind you this was your brainstorm.	I'll drop off my fare, hit a quick choke-and-puke and be blocking for you pronto.

1 Ran into a little hassle at the eatum- up-stop.	You okay?
2 Just fine. What's the weather like?	God's back on our side, so let's get smokin'.
3 Roger. Keep the shiny side up and the greasy side down.  Right, Fred?

1 Breaker. Breaker.	Pick it up, Breaker.
2 Thanks for the break. Bandit, this here's the Dixie Chicken.	What's up, Dixie Chicken?

1 Bandit II. We'll be back on the highway in a second. Over.	I'll keep my eyeballs peeled.

1 -- Breaker, Breaker. This is Banana Peel.	-- Yeah, Banana Peel, go head on.
2 -- Did ya hear they nailed the Bandit?	-- Yeah, I heard. But they won't hold him for long. Anyway, he sure gave them sumbitches a run for their money.

1 Unreal, this guys jacket too. Wall- to-wall major felony offenses, murder, extortion, arson, grand larceny --  -- A paternity suit... I just feel like we're playing catch-up with all this and we shouldn't be.	Welcome to the new Bureau. Nobody shares information anymore, it's become synonymous with job security.
2 Based on what we had, I thought Sparazza was a mid-level player at best and it turns out he's this mob relic, running the show out west.

1 Who?	The other agent. He said he was here to do an inspection and later, when he got on the elevator with the other guy, Carruthers, I saw him wearing one of our security jackets...

1 -- Forget about the tissue damage you're doing to the heart itself. Sustained cocaine abuse will segue you from a very painful ventricular fibrillation into full cardiac arrest.  Buddy, nobody knows about your condition, or your drug use. Why you lied to me, knowing that I'd find out anyway, I'll never know, but it imperative now that I see you.	That's not possible. I told you.
2 There are certain meds, certain intravenous measures that can counteract some of the damage you've done, but I'd have to administer them myself.	Won't work, we're just gonna have to chance it man. I'm sorry.
3 No. Sorry comes later, when you're in a partial coma with ambulatory paralysis. Sorry comes when we have to decide which of your limbs have to be amputated because severely constricted blood flow has brought about a gangrenous infection, sorry --	-- Fine, fuck, I got it... Lake Tahoe, Nevada. I'll have Hugo book your flight, you can be here in a couple hours. He'll meet you at the airport.

1 Jesus Hugo! How is it that you can turn a simple conversation into a fucking hedge maze!? This is zero degree of difficulty man!	Okay.
2 Then why are you still looking at me like I'm asking for the square root of something! What did you say!?

1 Y'ain't never had to wash another man's blood off, dig it out y'fingernails... Y'had us for that. Y'ain't ever made a real beef on y'own, shit as light in the ass as you are, I'll bet you ain't ever made anything more than a fuck'n fist your whole life.  So if you think I'mma let your lil' punk-ass, with the dirt I've done for you, in the eleventh hour, sell me off like some fucking field nigger, hand me up to the Feds like y'last chip, then you done gone straight out-your-motherfucking MIND!	That's Mecklen. The deal's closing. I can pick that phone up and I can work this out.  You'll walk with me.

1 On an extradition flight back to El Salvador, he murdered a security detachment and vanished.	You think it's possible he could be involved in the Israel hit?
2 Possibly. Acosta is pure mercenary. And a million dollar hit fee will draw some huge flies. But forget about Sparazza's money for a moment and remember, there's no shortage of those who want Israel killed and no shortage of cash to do just that...

1 ...Are you insane?	...Almost.  What do you mean "who Sparazza actually was..."

1 ... Jesus... what for?	-- who can say. He's off his onion, y'know, he's old school Sicilian, this is how they hate.
2 Wow.	Hey, we nab Israel, they pay t'get'm back, I'll cut the fuckin' thing out m'self, no extra charge. My thing is, we crew up, let's not fuck around, someone's cousin, some Zip off the boat from Naples, let's get pros, people who know how to behave.
3 Yeah, there's a pair'a broads I'm thinking might be good for this.	Chances are, they're gonna get into some shit too, hafta put people down.
4 That's not a problem. Are we goin' outta pocket ourselves?	Yeah, I can front this.
5 Well just so I got a quote in my head. What's the rate for the Swede?	That's the punchline, y'ready?
6 Shoot.	A million flat.
7 No shit.	None whatsoever.

1 When them tricks hit the lobby, holla at me and I'm gonna meet them on the way up, blend in. Once I get inside, I'mma put m'Nina to Israel's head and back out hot. Anybody's fucks with that program, y'break 'em off. They get gully --	I'mma grip and rip girl.  I got some handloads here ready to cut heads.
2 Jus' remember, this is more rescuin' shit than rampagin' shit... What are you shootin'?	...Girl, y'know I had to bring big mamma through.

1 I DON'T KNOW!	Jus' keep doin' y'damage girl, keep these mafuckas off my as--

1 No.  There's no behavior modification.	She reappeared exactly as she had before?

1 Is there anybody else here?	Why, who did you see?
2 Gibarian warned me.  He left me a message.	Who was it?
3 She was real.  Where did she come from?

1 We can liquidate the station.  Take the Athena back.	No.
2 Of course, when we return, we'll be regarded as lunatics if we tell the truth.  We'll chalk it up to isolation, collective derangement.	I've never heard you express any desire to leave before now.  Why now?
3 Well, I think we're reaching the point of diminishing returns here, right?  Certainly it's learning more about us than we'll ever learn about it.	But why is it doing what it's doing? Given it's resources, it could have done anything.  Presented me with your double, and you with mine.
4 Perhaps it did.	Human beings can die.
5 But they are human.  They certainly become human with incredible speed. First they're like they were in our memory, but then they fill in on their own.  DNA doesn't determine the hundreds of trillions of connections that occur in the brain, it's not dense enough.  They build up with experience.

1 I need to see Snow.	I'll go with you.
2 I'll just be a minute.

1 Is it a planet?	Not exactly.  It exists in a continuum that wasn't proven until ten years ago, a higher mathematical dimension superimposed on top of the Universe. An infinite number of them, in fact. It was a violation of all of our various laws regarding the Universe, Space, or Space-Time.  It was completely counter-intuitive.  We had to unlearn everything.
2 Is it intelligent?	Intelligent beyond our comprehension.
3 Then it's God, right?	It's something.
4 You still don't believe in God?	The whole idea of God was dreamed up by a silly animal with a small brain called Man.  Even the limits we put on it are human limits.  It can do this, it can do that!  It designs, it creates!
5 Even a God that wasn't active, that just created something and stood back and watched?	You're talking about a man in a white beard again.  You're ascribing human characteristics to something that isn't human.  Human beings look for causes and patterns.  How could we know what Solaris is up to, if anything?

1 Do you have any idea how much I like fucking you?	I think so.
2 Good.  Because I want you to know. I really like fucking you.

1 But we fought.	Yes.  Especially toward the end.
2 Why did she do it?	You... she said I didn't love her.
3 Was she right?	No.  I love you.
4 I love you, too.

1 I'm not Rheya.  You've always known that.	Rheya --
2 Don't call me that.

1 He won't do it.	Why do you say that?
2 He won't.

1 It's terrific Win.	You still writing the occasional magazine article?
2 Occasionally.	Then c'mon.  Follow me.  The art's in the basement, you're going to get a privileged peek.

1 Put it on my account, please.	I got money.

1 You mean to tell me, a mugger would stay away from someone because they walked a certain way?	Absolutely.  Look at this.

1 Stop, will you?!	Let go!
2 Stop being nuts!	I trusted you!  I thought you cared about me?!
3 I do care about you!	More bullshit!  More bullshit!  What kind of odds are they giving me?  There must be some kind of office pool.  One month?  A couple of days?

1 What a memory.	Do you dance?
2 Do you?	Pretty bad.
3 Let's do it.

1 You still going away?	I don't know...
2 You don't have to, now.	I think it's probably still a good idea.

1 Mom, what's going to happen with you and Dad?	I don't know Tommy.

1 Changing the sparks.  They showed it on TV.  What d'you think?	I think television's a dangerous thing.
2 It's twenty bucks in the bank.

1 Mike, take it easy...	Take it easy!  I set her up.  I saw it coming.
2 It's not your fault.  Mike, please get off the case.	It is my fault!  I'm responsible for her!
3 Did you hear what I said?	Did you hear what I said?!!

1 Ellie...	I'm all right.

1 Let's go.  We're takin' her home!  Move it!  Get the cars!	Koontz!  I need you guys!
2 We'll call SWAT.  We'll get the locals.  Throw it!	No, I need'm now!

1 You're not going to talk to anyone without a lawyer.	She's not a suspect, sir, she's a witness.  Could I ask you to step outside, please.
2 No, I will not step outside.	Sir, I am just trying to do my job, it's standard procedure to question the witness alone.  Help me out here, could you please leave.
3 I don't really see what that has to do with...

1 God!  Scrambled eggs surprise?! These are pickles...!  God!	Just "lay back, Mack"... lay back...

1 Peter-- you took this picture?	Let me see.

1 Mistake?  Hey, guy, get back here!	Hm.  What a lump.

1 Oh, I need your notes from the classes I missed.	Well, I've missed a lot of classes myself...
2 Oh. Well, hang in there, amigo.

1 Thank you.  Now, repeat after me-- Spider-Man is a good guy. On the side of right, and niceness, and cute baby animals and all that.	Frmpph-yrr.
2 Fine.

1 It's never too early to be clever. Describe in a sentence how you feel about me.	Huh?
2 Fill in the blank: "I blank Elizabeth Allan."	I-- uh--
3 Uh is a good start.	I lov-loathe Elizabeth Allan. Abhor, detest, despise--
4 Oh.  Well, I hate you and everyone who looks like you.

1 Brrr.  It's colder than New Hampshire in here.	I'm sure you kept warm.

1 Hello, Liz.	Hello.  So very boring.  Peter Parker, how do you feel about me this morning?
2 I... I like you.  A lot.	Hm.  Well, I like you, too.  I like your aunt.  I like your shoelaces. I like--

1 There's nothing in there worth stealing!	That's the understatement of the year.

1 Peter, you're bleeding.	It's fine.  Tell me what--
2 Oh, Ben gets through everything.	Aunt May, what happened?
3 I was napping on the couch.  There was a voice and a shot.  I woke up. Ben was looking at me.	How is he?
4 He'll be fine. They won't tell me anything, but I'm sure he'll be fine.

1 No.  No thank you.  I have work.	I heard about Thorkel's order--
2 I left a paper in my desk.

1 Need any more help?	No, thank you.  I'm sure you've got your own problems.

1 You're sure you're all right.	Yeah, just a lung full of New Jersey.  Lucky you showed up when you did.
2 Logic.  Lot 49 is the closest stockpile of SL 270--  I do feel foolish talking with a man dressed like a--	Imagine how I feel.
3 Excuse me if I'm impertinent, but-- how did you become whatever it is you are?	The usual.  Heredity and environment.  What's the deal with Doc Ock?
4 He'll try to finish his experiment.	And blow up the universe just to prove he's right?  Bit egotistical, isn't it?
5 A messianic complex is nothing new to Octavius. In  his universe, there's only one mind-- his own. It must be very lonely.	Forgive me if I don't feel too sympathetic right now.

1 Maybe just a hint or so. Think hard.	I don't have to think. We didn't tell anything to anybody. Not a word. Not until we hit this barrack.

1 What's the matter? You on their team now? You think I'm the guy?	I don't know anymore.

1 Static is right! The radio's static, Patton's static, we're static!	Maybe it's going to be a longer war than you figured -- eh, Duke?

1 Put me down for ten, you louse.	I'll call the whole pot.

1 That's the general idea.  Only it's not so general as far as I'm concerned.	You are talking crazy!

1 I didn't do it. I was in the Frankfurt station and the train was three miles away when it blew up.	Oh, come now! You threw a time bomb.
2 How could I have had a time bomb? They searched me when they took me prisoner.

1 Hey, Schulz! I got a deal for you. Suppose you help us escape. We'll go home and have everything ready for you in Madison Square Garden. For the world championship! Schulz, the Beast of Bavaria versus Halitosis Jones!	Droppen Sie dead!  Raus mit dem Ofen. Los! Los!

1 Let me go! Let me go!	They'll shoot you, Animal!

1 Schnickelfritz! I told you Schnickelfritz! Why'd you make me bet on Equipoise!	I clocked him this morning. He was running like a doll.
2 You clocked him! Why don't I clock you?

1 There, Joey -- ain't that better than being a lawyer?	Animal! Got a little something for you!

1 Wait a minute. We have some rights here.  Why is this man being taken out?	Curtains would do wonders for this barrack.  You will not get them.

1 No volunteers, Price. I said we're all in on it.	You have elected me Security. The way things have been going in this Barracks, I guess I've done a poor job and I want to make up for it. Is that asking too much?

1 What's the big idea, Sefton? Take that telescope out of here.	Says who?
2 Says me.	You take it out. Only you're going to have a riot on your hands.
3 Every time the men get Red Cross packages you have to think up an angle to rob them.

1 Go on.	He's a Nazi, Price is. For all I know, his name is Preismaier or Preissinger. Sure, he lived in Cleveland, but when the war broke out he came back to the Fatherland like a good little Bundist. He spoke our lingo so they put him through spy school, gave him phony dogtags --

1 When the Krauts find that gadget they'll throw us all in the boob.	They know about that gadget. I'd worry more about the radio.

1 Which one of us is the informer?	You are trying to say that an American would inform on other Americans?

1 What's the matter with you? You want to be killed?	Not particularly.

1 That wouldn't be the cigarettes you took us for last night?	What was I going to do with them? I only smoke cigars.

1 Where is he now?	I don't know. He bathed, now he is roaming the ship. He must be the only Engineer in Starfleet who does not go to Engineering!

1 Fear is a very difficult emotion to overcome. It's something we all have to learn to deal with.	But I did not deal with it, sir. I let it prevent me from helping my friend.  Does that make me a coward?
2 No. And what you must try to avoid is becoming consumed by another emotion which I believe you're beginning to experience: guilt.	Guilt. It is a most unpleasant feeling.

1 Is she still angry?	No, but I'd stay out of Sickbay for a while if I were you. I still don't know why you dropped her in the water.
2 I was attempting to get in the spirit of things. I thought it would be humorous.

1 Sensors show five life signs aboard the station, Captain.	The station complement was nineteen.

1 Guinan. It's important that you tell me what you know. We think Soran's developed a weapon...a terrible weapon. It might give him enough power to-	Soran doesn't care about power or weapons. All he cares about is getting back to the Nexus.
2 What's the "Nexus"?

1 Well, may we have a look around?	Please, please.

1 Antonia?	She's not real either, is she? Nothing here is. Nothing here matters.

1 Captain, it may be possible to simulate a torpedo blast using a resonance burst from the main deflector dish.	Where are the deflector relays?

1 Sir?	Make it so.

1 Well, with all due respect to your Betazoid senses, I prefer to be alone right now.	Very well. I suppose I could make out my weekly report to Starfleet Command without your input.  "Admiral Lusby, regarding the unusual behavior of Jean-Luc Picard: I find him increasingly irritable, remote and uncooperative. I recommend forced shore leave at a Starbase facility in order to-"
2 All right, all right. You've made your point.

1 I've spent eighty years looking for another way, Captain. This is the only one.  Of course, you could always come with me. You fancy yourself an explorer. Here's a chance to explore something no human has ever experienced.	Not if it means killing over two hundred million people.  I wonder, did your wife Leandra know that she married a man who was capable of mass murder?

1 They have found a way to penetrate our shields.	Lock phasers and return fire!

1 Will we get another ship?	I can't get an answer. Starfleet is up to its brass in galactic conference. No one has time for those who only stand... and wait.

1 Sir, the shields... Non- responsive.	Scotty...?

1 This is where the fun begins, Saavik!	Like your father... so human.  All units functional, recorders are on... Scanning sector one. Foliage in fully developed state of growth. Temperature, twenty- two point two Celsius.
2 Sector two... Indicating desert terrain. Minimal vegetation, temperature thirty-nine point four.	Sector three... Sub-tropical vegetation... Temperature --  Temperature decreasing rapidly --
3 It's snow. Snow in the same sector. Fantastic!	... Fascinating.
4 All the varieties of land and weather known to Earth within a few hours walk!	You must be very proud of what you and your mother have created.
5 It's a little early to celebrate.

1 Later. Let's go...	Grissom, your message acknowledged. Will advise... Out.

1 Captain, this is Saavik. Come in, please...	Yes, Saavik, go ahead...

1 Mr. Scott, all power to the weapons systems --	Aye, sir!

1 My God...	Much is at stake...

1 We are secured from Warp Speed... Now entering Genesis Sector of Mutara Quadrant.	What about Grissom, Mr. Chekov?

1 Uhura, any response from Starfleet on our Project Genesis inquiries?	No, sir, no response.
2 Hmm.. Very odd.  Scotty. Progress report?

1 Yes... I hear you.  I just had to try.	Of course... Now take my suggestion, enjoy your leave -- and let all this tension blow away.
2 You're right.  Thanks for the drink.	Any time.

1 Ambassador, I -- I had no idea you were here...  I think you know my crew...	I will speak with you alone, Kirk.

1 We are cloaked. Enemy closing on impulse power. Range, 5,000 Kellicams.	Good.  This is the turn of luck I have been waiting for.

1 My Lord... what are your orders?	I underestimated him... He did the one thing I didn't anticipate ... He destroyed himself...
2 Sir, may I --	Killing his son was <U>stupid</U>! It made Kirk willing to die.
3 We still have the prisoners, sir. Perhaps their information --	They are useless! It was Kirk I needed. And I let him slip away.
4 But surely, our mission has not failed -- ?	Our mission is over. I have failed... A human has been bolder and more ruthless than I...  That -- is the real dishonor.

1 Cheers. Bones, these are... charming.	Four hundred years old. You don't find many with the lens still intact.
2 Uh -- what are they?	For your eyes. For most patients of your age, I generally administer Retlax Five to restore flexibility of the lens.
3 But I'm allergic to Retlax.	Exactly. Happy birthday.

1 They even killed the galley chief.	This one looks like a Steward. They're not warm, but rigor hasn't set in. This didn't happen all that long ago, Jim.

1 I still don't under --	We have received new orders. Upon our arrival at Regula I, all materials of Project Genesis will be transferred to this ship for immediate testing at Ceti Alpha VI.

1 Does that about do it?	I don't think there's another piece of information we could squeeze into the memory banks. Next time, we'll design a bigger one.
2 Who --

1 You're crazy -- !	I saw it -- !
2 There's an air-lock.

1 I'm Admiral Kirk...	<u>We were still there</u>, you dumb bastard! We could hear the screams all the way to the transporter room --

1 What are <u>you</u> looking at?	I don't know.

1 No sir! We have Genesis -- Whatever you want --	<u>Full power damn you</u>!

1 Goodbye, Admiral. Oh, and don't count on Enterprise. She can't move. My next act will be to blow her out of the heavens.	KHAN!

1 I'm getting a voice message... wait ... short range band. They say their Chambers coil is shorting their COMM system.	Spock?

1 Admiral, I've got to take the mains off the line. The energizer's shaken loose and I can't get in there to fix her -- radiation --	All right, we'll do the job with auxiliary power.

1 Is the word given?	The word is given: warp speed.
2 Aye...

1 There are two possibilities, sir they are unwilling to respond, they are unable to respond.	How far?
2 Twelve hours and forty-three minutes, present speed.	Give up Genesis, she said. What in God's name does that mean? Give it up to whom?
3 It might help my analysis if I knew what Genesis was.

1 The prefix code?	It's all we've got.

1 Sporadic energy readings port side, aft. Could be an impulse turn.	He won't break off now. If he followed me this far he'll be back. But from where...?
2 He's intelligent, but not experienced. His pattern indicates two dimensional thinking...

1 May I speak, sir?	Lieutenant, self-expression does not seem to be one of your problems.
2 I wish to thank you for the high efficiency rating.	You earned it.
3 I did not think so.	You're bothered by your performance on the <u>Kobayashi Maru</u>.
4 I failed to resolve the situation.	There is no correct resolution. It is a test of character.
5 May I ask how <u>you</u> dealt with the test?	You may ask, Lieutenant.

1 It doesn't make sense. These coordinates are well within Regula -- a plantoid we know to be lifeless and airless.	If Stage Two was completed, it was underground -- she said it was going to be underground.
2 Stage Two of what?

1 Cease fire. Look sharp.	Power levels quite low, sir.
2 Mr. Scott, can you get the mains back on line?

1 Reliant in our section this quadrant, sir, and slowing --	Visual.

1 Shields activated!	Inform the Klingons we are on a rescue mission...

1 Lieutenant, how many times have you piloted a Starship out of Spacedock?	Never, sir.

1 Professor Scott, I'm Dr. Nichols, plant manager. I'm terribly sorry but there's been an awful mix-up Would you believe I was never told about your visit?	I tried to clear things up, Professor Scott. I explained you'd come all the way from Edinburgh on appointment to study manufacturing methods here at Plexico, but they don't seem to know anything about it.

1 I prefer a dose of common sense. you are proposing to head backwards in time, find Humpback Whales, then bring them forward in time, drop them off - and hope they tell this Probe what to do with itself!	-- That's the general idea.
2 That's crazy!	If you have a better idea - now's the time.

1 Most unusual. An unknown form of energy of great intelligence and power. I find it illogical that its intentions are hostile...	Really? You think this is its way of saying "Hi there" to the people of the Earth?
2 There are millions of other species on Earth, Doctor. Only human arrogance would assume the message was meant for man.	I liked him better before he died.

1 What's your degree in, dentistry?	How do you explain slowing pulse, low respiratory rate and coma?
2 Fundoscopic examination --	Fundoscopic examination is unrevealing in these cases!
3 A simple evacuation of the expanding epidural hematoma will relieve the pressure.	My God, man, drilling holes in his head is not the answer. The artery must be repaired without delay or he will die! So put away your butcher knives and let me save the patient!

1 No, sir. And no Federation wessels on assigned patrol stations.	That's odd. Uhura, what's on the Comm channels...?

1 They like you very much. But they are not the hell your whales.	I suppose they told you that...?
2 The hell they did.

1 Memory problems, too.	Uh huh. What about you? Where you from?
2 Iowa.	A landlubber. Come on, what the hell were you boys really trying to do back there? Was it some kinda macho thing? If that's all, I'm gonna be real disappointed. I hate that macho type.
3 Can I ask <u>you</u> something?	Go ahead.
4 What's going to happen when you release the whales?

1 What's that?	What's what?
2 You got a pocket pager? What are you, a doctor?

1 You tricked me.	You need me.

1 Ready to engage computer, Admiral.	What is our target in time?
2 The late 20th Century.	Surely you can be more specific...
3 Not with this equipment. I have had to program some of the variables from memory.	What are the variables...?
4 Availability of fuel components; Mass of the vessel through a time continuum, and the probable location of Humpbacks, in this case, the Pacific basin.	You've programmed that from memory...?
5 I have.

1 Spock...	Yes?
2 About those colorful metaphors we discussed. I don't think you should try to use them.	Why not?
3 Well, for one thing, you haven't quite got the hang of it.	I see.
4 And another thing... It is not always necessary to tell the truth.	I cannot tell a lie.
5 You don't have to lie... You could exaggerate.	Exaggerate.
6 You've done it before. Can't you remember?	The hell I can't
7 What else did you learn from your mind meld?	They are very unhappy about the way their species has been treated by man.
8 They have a right to be...  Do you think they'll help us?	I believe I was successful in communicating our intentions.
9 ... I see.

1 Spock: Condition report!	No data, Admiral. Computers are non-functional.

1 10,000 M.S.L., Admiral.	Wing to cruise configuration... Full impulse power.
2 Aye, sir... Three-one-zero to the Bering Sea. E.T.A.: 12 minutes.

1 I'll have bearing and distance for you, sir.	Right.  Now look: I want you all to be very careful. This is terra incognita. Many customs will doubtless take us by surprise. It's a forgone conclusion these people have never seen an extra-terrestrial before.

1 We're ready, sir. I've converted the Dilithium Sequencer to something less primitive. And Admiral -- I've replaced the Klingon Food Packs. They was givin' me sour stomach.	Appreciated by all, Mr. Scott.  Prepare for departure.

1 Admiral! There be whales here!	Well done, Mr. Scott. How soon can we be ready for warp speed?
2 I'll have to re-energize.	Don't take too long. We're sitting ducks for their radar systems...  Mr. Sulu, impulse climb.

1 Don't know anything about it? I find it difficult to believe that I've come millions of miles --	Millions?

1 Chotto omachi nasarei. Namae wa nanto moosareruka na.  Wait my son. What is your name?	Sulu Hikaru.
2 Ah, sorenara mazu mazu nagaiki wo sareru to mira.  Ah... Then I am sure that you will have a long and happy life.	Arigato. Sayonara.  Thank you, honorable sir.

1 The craftsmanship is extraordinary.	This is a school... that's a student's work.  She'll be ready to become an apprentice soon. Then, in thirty or forty years, she'll take her place among the artisans...
2 An apprentice for thirty years.  We've noticed your people's mental discipline. Did that develop here?	More questions. Always the explorer. If you stay long enough, that'll change.
3 Will it?	You'll stop reviewing what happened yesterday... stop planning for tomorrow... until you find...  Let me ask you a question -- have you ever experienced a perfect moment in time?
4 A perfect moment?	When time seemed to stop... and you could almost live in that moment...
5 Seeing my home planet from space for the first time...	Yes. Exactly. Nothing more complicated than perception.  You explore the universe. We've discovered a single moment in time can be a universe in itself... full of powerful forces... most people aren't aware enough of the now... to ever notice them...
6 I wish I could spare a few centuries to learn.	It took us centuries to learn that it doesn't have to take centuries to learn.

1 But I have three hundred and eighteen days of vacation time coming. I plan on using them.	I'll be here.

1 I have to go home now.	Bye.

1 Yes... that looks like them.	What's the last thing you remember, Data...
2 'his nose should pant and his lip should curl...'	From the mission...
3 I was in an isolation suit collecting physiometric data on Ba'ku children. My last memory is going into the hills, following a boy...

1 Your Federation procedures have made this mission ten times as difficult as it needed to be...	Our procedures were in place to protect the planet's population from unnecessary risk...
2 Planet's population. Six hundred people. You want to avoid unnecessary risks? Next time leave your android home.

1 You have no idea what precipitated his behavior?	... And now he's holding our people hostage down there...
2 The Enterprise can be at your position in two days, Admiral...	That's probably not a good idea. Your ship hasn't been fitted for this region; there are environmental concerns...
3 What kind of concerns?	We haven't fully identified the anomalies yet. They're calling this whole area The Briar Patch... it took us a day to reach a location where we could get a signal out to you. Just get me Data's schematics. I'll keep you informed.  Dougherty out.

1 The countdown control has been transferred to the collector...I can't override...	Scan for lifesigns.

1 The torque sensors are out of alignment... by twelve microns... you could hear that?	When I was an ensign, I could detect a three-micron mis- alignment...

1 I don't think they believe us.	Why not?

1 'Yew-cheen chef-faw.'	Deck ten.

1 We came here from a solar system on the verge of self- annihilation... where technology had created weapons that threatened to destroy all life. A small group of us set off to find a new home... a home that would be isolated from the threats of other worlds.  That was three hundred and nine years ago.	You've not aged a day since then?
2 Actually, I was a good deal older when we arrived... in terms of my physical condition.

1 Sir, if we fire a tachyon burst, it may force him to reset his shield harmonics. When he does, we could beam him out...	Make it so.

1 You need a haircut, Commander.	Accelerated hair growth is often experienced by Klingons during Jak'tahla...

1 I don't see anything to suggest the Son'a have any interest in sociology...	What are they interested in...?
2 Wine, women and song.	You should feel right at home with them.

1 All hands. Battle stations!	And have you noticed how your boobs have started to firm up?

1 What are we waiting for? Let's go.	It may not be that simple. This is an extremely difficult and paranoid time in human history.
2 Are you saying they won't help us?	I'm saying they might shoot us on sight. You have to remember... these people have watched their entire way of life collapse around them.
3 There must be some good people... even in this time.	Let's hope so. Because if Cochrane dies... the future may die with him.

1 You are the guiding intelligence behind the Borg...?	Intelligence... ambition... desire... I bring order to chaos...

1 Isn't it better like this...?	Yes... but the Enterprise... my duty...
2 ... is to yourself. Don't make me hurt you again...

1 Mister Data, I want to know the exact date and time.  Give me a damage report on that missile silo.	Today is March second, 2063. The time in Montana is oh-eight-forty- five.

1 What did you do to the batteries?	Oh... just a little tinkering. How is he?

1 Where's you get the alloy for the throttle itself?	They used copper pipes in their plumbing... so I melted it down... and fused it with some tritanium from one of our phaser casings.  It's not the strongest alloy... but it's better than all this crude aluminum and steel.

1 The inertial dampers are having trouble compensating... I don't think Cochrane built this thing for comfort.	Speed -- two hundred, seventy-five thousand kilometers per second.

1 That was a pretty clever trick you did with the hospital's batteries. How'd you do it?	It wasn't a trick. I used to be an electrical engineer.
2 Huh.

1 "Money." So you can get dome money...	I can try.
2 You'd have to try real hard. No one's used currency in over ten years. What are you, from another planet?

1 Incoming transmission from the Borg.	On screen.

1 Worf, have Doctor Crusher, Mister La Forge and a security team meet me in Transporter Room Three. Civilian clothes.	Aye, sir.

1 Casualties are light, Captain. Minor buckling on the port nacelle. Nothing serious.	Incoming message from the Starship Intrepid. Admiral Hayes.

1 You will have to realign the targeting array of the quantum torpedo... and reprogram the warhead for the localized detonation.  There's only one torpedo left...	I guess I'd better get it right the first time.
2 The Borg will undoubtedly attack. Set phasers to rotating modulation.

1 I have to admit there was a moment there when --	Hold that thought.

1 Mr. President.	Admiral Donald...Bill...
2 Mr. President we cannot allow Federation citizens to be abducted.	At present I'm awaiting a full report from Enterprise. Pending that I am constrained to observe Interstellar Law.

1 Uh, Jim...	You heard the order, Lieutenant.

1 What kind of creature is this? Last night you two were spooning -	Don't remind me.

1 This is fun...	Captain, shall we attempt to return fire?

1 They'll respect him now...	That's a comfort...

1 And now we come to the architect of this tragic affair, Captain James Tiberius Kirk. I put it to you, Captain, that you were seeking revenge for the death of your son.	That isn't true...!
2 That, either as an instrument of Federation policy or acting on your own drunken initiative, you and your fellow conspirators crippled KRONOS One and cold-bloodedly assassinated the Chancellor of the High Council. Then you and Doctor McCoy went aboard to make certain the job was complete.

1 Get close enough to a man and you can kill him on "Stun" without setting off the alarm - of course you can't get rid of the body...	First rule of assassination: always kill the assassins.

1 Klingon blood.	They must have walked through it when it was floating and tracked it back here.
2 This is the first evidence that corroborates our theory.	Now we go to Starfleet?
3 Now we expand our search to include uniforms.	ALL uniforms?

1 Your research laboratory is most impressive...	Starfleet's been charting and cataloging planetary atmospheres. All vessels are equipped with chemical analytic sensors...
2 This cannot be easy for you, Captain...  I would feel awkward if I had to give you a tour of OUR vessel...

1 How much time's left of your sentence?	Don't you know? Everyone on Rura Penthe is here for life.

1 Aye, sir.	Plot a course for Kronos, Lieutenant.
2 Kronos, sir?	I'm still in the chair, Lieutenant.
3 Aye, sir.

1 I'm getting underway now. But you should know, I'm in alpha Quadrant. The chances of my reaching the conference in time are slim.	When does this conference start?
2 According to my information, today.	Thank you, Captain Sulu.
3 Don't mention it, Captain Kirk.

1 We HAVEN'T fired -	According to the data bank, we HAVE - twice...

1 Captain, perhaps we're going about this the wrong way; our job is to get to the conference; HER job will be to stop us.	Make ourselves a target?

1 Captain, we can't see her, but she gives off heat...	Not from a distance. She won't show up on ANY type of scan.

1 If you are logical.	I don't want to.
2 I believe you. Please...

1 I have confirmed the location, sir, but...	What is it?
2 ... I cannot confirm the existence of Praxis.

1 - could take weeks, sir.	Thank you, Mr. Scott. We were to return to spacedock, the killers would surely manage to dispose of their incriminating footwear.

1 Under impulse power she expends fuel like any other ship. We call it "Plasma" - I do not know the Klingon name for it, but by any name it is merely ionized gas.	Well, what about all that atmospheric equipment we're carrying to catalogue gaseous anomalies?

1 I notice Dr. Crusher laughing along with the rest of you. As most of you know, the doctor will also soon be leaving the Enterprise, to assume command of Starfleet Medical. Again, I'm forced to ask, Beverly, have you considered what you're doing to little ole me?! I'll probably get some old battle-axe of a doctor who'll tell me to eat my vegetables and put me on report if I dont show up for my physical on time!	It'll serve you right.

1 How long does he have?	I can't be sure but the rate of decay seems to be accelerating.

1 He is very observant.	I can see that.

1 Can you open the shuttlebay doors?	Affirmative, sir. Negative, sir. They have instigated security overrides and erected a force field around the external portals.
2 Well then... only one way to go.

1 You have a red shirt.	This is not an appropriate time for a conversation.
2 Why?	Because the captain has to concentrate on piloting the vehicle.
3 Why?

1 It's you.	The resemblance is... striking.

1 Shinzon's Viceroy seems to have the ability to reach into my thoughts. I've become a liability... I request to be relieved of my duties.	Permission denied. If you can possibly endure any more of these assaults.  I need you at my side. Now more than ever I...

1 Captain Picard, Commander Donatra of the Warbird Valdore. Might we be of assistance?	Your timing is impeccable, Commander.
2 The Empire considers this a matter of internal security. We regret you've become involved.	When this is over, I owe you a drink.

1 What's he doing?	He wants to look me in the eye.

1 Enterprise. We are the Reman Warbird Scimitar.	Praetor Shinzon, I'm pleased to...
2 I am not Shinzon. I am his Viceroy. We are sending transport coordinates.

1 Worf, prepare a full phaser spread, zero elevation. All banks on my mark. Scan for shield impacts and stand by photon torpedoes.	Aye, sir

1 Why don't they answer our hails?	It's an old psychological strategy, Number One. To put him in a position of dominance and make us uneasy.
2 It's working.	Counselor?

1 But she's not the Enterprise.	I promise you in time, she'll become your home ...If I could offer you one piece of advice?
2 Anything.	When your first officer insists that you can't go on away missions... Ignore him.
3 I intend to.

1 No one knew what to do. Finally I was taken to a doctor who had some experience with Terran illnesses and I was finally diagnosed with Shalaft's syndrome. Do you know of it, Captain?	You know I do.

1 Shinzon... I'm trying to believe you.	I know.
2 If there's one ideal the Federation holds most dear it's that all men, all races, can be united. From the first time the Vulcans came to Earth we've sought a future of peace. Nothing would make me more proud than to take your hand in friend- ship. In time. When trust has been earned.	I'm honored to think I might someday speak with such eloquence.

1 That's your life... not mine.	Please.
2 Its too late.	You can still make a choice! Make the right one now!
3 I have no choices! I can't fight what I am!

1 Believe it or not, I think the cavalry has arrived.	We're being hailed.

1 What is it?!! Focus on your job!!	She is here.

1 Benny, there's nothing there.	There is. They came out of the belly of the ship and then went to the first terrace and flew down into the houses.
2 Flew?! Oh, come on Benny...

1 What do you think of America?	It is beautiful.

1 George, we've just confirmed the existence of the live extraterrestrial.	When can we expect containment?
2 Well, we're in pursuit of a green Mustang...	It's in a green Mustang?
3 Yes. It's kidnapped a woman at gunpoint and from what we can make out is forcing her to drive it somewhere.

1 I won't let anyone hurt you.	Watch it. They're coming out.

1 Steering wheel...	What.

1 Mi-chi-gan driver li-see-ens... Jennyhaydn... Money?	We're going to have to stop for gas soon.

1 That's a big help. Where are you from?	From?
2 Are you from up there? Space?	Space?
3 Up there... I... eh... can't explain...  But that's the only place you could be from.

1 What is...  ...Coke?	A drink.
2 I...	You want to try it?
3 I want to try it.	This stuff could kill...  Be my guest.

1 The closest I was able to get you was Lathrop Wells...	Is that a baby?
2 Yes.	A baby is a new person?
3 Eh... yes...	Do you have a baby?
4 No... The closest...	Why?
5 I'd love to have a baby. But I can't...	Why?
6 I can't... Forget the baby. Okay? The closest I was able to get you was Lathrop Wells. You'll have to hitchhike the rest of the way.

1 Goodbye.	What?
2 It's a kiss...  Goodbye...

1 You shouldn't drink so much of that stuff. It's bad for you.	On the radio they say it's good.
2 Hurry up.

1 You are cold.	You're damn right I am.
2 I do not get cold.

1 It'll tell you pretty much everything about us...	This is very interesting. We are born knowing our history. We have other books. But not a book like this.
2 Any words you don't know you can find in the dictionary.	I understand.
3 It'll give you the different countries, how they came to be, what they are now, how America came to be, the governments, the languages... everything.	Many of my people will not believe those things are possible. On my planet there is only one government, one people, one language. I will be asked a lot of questions.
4 What will you say about us?	I will say that we can be friends.
5 We can.

1 I love you.	I'm never going to see you again, am I?
2 No.

1 The five-fifty. We already passed it. But it'll take him way out of his way.	Pull over. I've got to get back there.
2 Why wouldn't he want to go through the roadblock?... What did you guys do?... I won't tell anybody.	It's easier not to tell if you don't know.

1 You get that, Lyman?	We're ready.

1 How would you describe the sounds we heard coming out of that thing's helmet?	It was kind of like clicking, maybe a language wasn't it?
2 Listen to this.  A woman was kidnapped in Eau Claire this morning. When a citizen went to her rescue the kidnapper threatened him with a gun and shouted at him in a strange 'clicking gibberish'...	It was a man though... right?
3 The police think he was high on drugs...

1 Yeah, that's right.	I saw you play, man.  You were good. Like a fucking freight train I remember saying.  So what happened, injuries or what?
2 Bullshit politics.	It's always politics.  Like this thing we're in here, he's paying you to tune me up, right?  But I could pay you more not to.  See what I mean?  I could write you a check right now--
3 Come on, let's go, I got to get back.	Okay cash!  Logical.  Here's everything I have on me, what do you say?  How about a Rolex?
4 I already got a real one.  Come on, it won't be too bad.  It's not personal.	Just not the eyes.

1 Well, I'm certainly in the mood for a party.	Take her up to the suite.  Have a glass of champagne... or six... I'll be up in a while to help you ring in the New Year.
2 I live for the moment.

1 I don't think that's a good idea, Lenny.	I just got to talk to you for one second.

1 So finally he gives Iris some cash and tells her to check into the hotel under a wrong name till he figures out what to do.	Yeah... he figured out what to do all right.
2 You think Tran killed her?	The killer knew right where she was. Because he put her there.
3 What a nightmare.

1 See, if you packed your piece you could've made the guy see sense.	Uh unh, carrying a gun wrecks the line of a fine jacket.
2 An ex-cop that doesn't carry.  It's embarrassing.  I oughta not be seen with you.  Hey, Mace.  What's goin' on?

1 Jesus.	Yeah.  So don't walk near me in public, alright.
2 Thanks, buddy.  See... things weren't bad enough.  They weren't fucking bad enough!

1 Only he doesn't know about me and Faith.  So I say to myself, if I turn the job down, he just gets somebody else.  And I lose Faith... to coin a phrase.  So to buy time, I do the skank.  I still gotta do something about Tran... I figure it's him or me... but I can't cap him without a chump to take the fall.  And who better than his girlfriend's loser ex-boyfriend... a known criminal... who has been seen hassling them in public numerous times.	And who was, regrettably, also your best fucking friend.
2 No plan is perfect, Lenny.  Hey, cheer up.  World's gonna end in ten minutes anyway.	You must be so pleased, I followed your jellybean trail right here, like a good little chump.
3 You got froggy on me a couple times.

1 Show a little respect, Nero.  The man was an important artist.	Yeah, important for your label. Which no doubt is why you're in mourning.  Don't worry, his records'll sell out now he's dead. You'll make out.
2 I always do.	Faith, can I talk to you a second?

1 What's his name?	Fumitsu.
2 Mr. Fumitsu, good evening sir, Leonard Nero, Security Express. Lornette Mason here is just completing our routine driver evaluation.  We do it to make sure that out VIP clients, such as yourself, are always treated as honored guests.  I just need to ride up front and take some notes, if you don't mind.

1 You're some piece of work, you know that.  Just calmly backstroking around in the big toilet bowl, and somehow you never let it touch you. I mean, between Vice and this so- called occupation you're in now, you must've seen it all.	I have crawled through the gutter... through every wrinkle in the human brain.
2 What I'm saying.  But you still come out this goofball romantic.	It is my sword and my shield, Macey.

1 Don't crank the gain any more. You're gonna fry yourself.	I need to see more... get more detail.  Something.  I feel his presence, so strong...

1 What is it?	This tie doesn't go with blue!

1 Those two guys were cops.	You sure?
2 It's the walk.  Something.  Anyway, they'll run your plates and get your address.  We gotta keep moving.

1 Yeah.  Lenny.  I have.	It didn't stop you from loving them. Right?  Or understanding them, or being able to forgive them...
2 I guess.	And it didn't stop you from wanting to protect them.  Did it?
3 No.  It didn't.

1 Hey, Lenny.  We made it.	Yeah.  We did.

1 So you're saying we just pretend is didn't happen?  It happened!  The LAPD executed one of the most important black men in America!  Who the fuck are you to bury this?!	Fine.  Do you want blood running waist deep in the storm drains?  The gangbangers'll spread like a wave through this city and burn it to the ground.  And when the fires start the street cops'll be capping off at anything that moves.  It'll be all- out war and you know it.
2 Yeah, well maybe it's time for a war!	You really want that on your head?

1 I hope that wasn't a joke because I can assure you, from personal experience, the FBI does not have a sense of humor.	That's right, Jan.

1 Ligature strangulation, just like his victims. A cord, nylon, you can tell by the indentation signature -- again, like his victims.  Look at that little thing and look at all the trouble it got him in. Should have cut it off.	I'm not in the mood for Native American wisdom.
2 We had to bring staff in from the whole county to handle this.	I appreciate it, doctor. You know how it is, press screaming for answers, Washington's all over me.  Ever handle a serial case?

1 I've been looking for you.	Why me? What do you want from me!?

1 Deputy Director, get out, sir.	What are you doing?
2 Please.

1 Nothing concrete. Nothing I'd... well, nothing.	I don't believe this.
2 I'm hesitant to...	Mack the Mouth at a loss for words.

1 When I was at the rest stop, there was a young boy, maybe ten, and his mother. Darryl Hawkins, Zero, abducted the boy in the men's room. I tried to stop him. He cold-cocked me --	Listen to this guy? Can you believe this? He'll never change. Born a liar, first word out of his mouth was a lie. Make up a story, always a story, any goddamn story, to save his ass.

1 Every cop has a story and every story has a girl. The girl in my story was fifteen years-old. She wore a pink angora sweater -- I can still see it -- one day, she disappeared. I told the police she wouldn't run away, I told them who to look for, but I was just a kid. I sat in the police station crying and crying. My parents took me home. The girl was my cousin and the man who abducted her was a teacher I'd had. He kept her alive a week before he killed her. The police could have saved her. Every time I see a photo of a victim I see her. That's what I want to do. I want to save her.	Me too.  Make any headway with "Zorro"?
2 None. Can't find a thing. Nothing on file, nothing online. It's not a part of any known killer's signature.	I was thinking, maybe we should ask Professor Daitz. Nobody knows this stuff better.
3 That's because he's a fucking wacko. Never met a self-promotion scheme he didn't like. What's he doing now?	He's a consultant to a network TV program on Profilers. He gets a check every episode.

1 Maybe we should back off a bit.	I can't. They trust me, they accept me. I've got their confidence.
2 No, I mean maybe we should back off a bit, you and me.	Oh.

1 It's quite advanced.	Burn marks. The original M.E. listed it as "burn residue." Same place, the outer thigh, as Karen Sumpter. The UNSUB is able to abduct, kill, transport and bury without detection.
2 All the same killer?	Low calls him Suspect Zero.
3 Suspect Zero is a crackpot theory. You said so.	That's what Koessler wants us to believe. To discredit Low.
4 You're assigned, we're assigned, to apprehend Richard Low, not Suspect Zero. I have to tell you, Mack, I'm not comfortable where you're going.	But it was your idea: "use Zero," you said, use Zero to get Low.

1 How did you know Speck was a killer?	The little piggie speaks.

1 Is he dead?	Yeah.
2 The boy's okay. I saw him...

1 Good morning, sir. Agent Salinas, sir.	So you're the new meat?
2 Yes, sir.	What did you do to end up here?
3 I believe it's in my file, sir.	Johnny, get this man's file. Mackelway, right?
4 Thomas Mackelway.	Hot enough for you, Agent Mackelway? Hell's doorknob. What they got you doing?
5 Updating the condition of all Bureau- owned vehicles in the southwest sector, sir.	Sounds like fun.

1 I'm Agent Thomas Mackelway, FBI. There is no way you will escape. Assistant Deputy Director Richard Low is en route with another Agent.  You may know Low by another name. You may know him by the name Murman. I am Lionheart.	Murman!
2 He's a brilliant man. Brilliant enough to catch you.	Brilliant? You think he caught any of them because he was brilliant? Hardboy? MyDick? Imelda? Ripper? Think about it, how did he locate them?  He found them as Murman. And how did Murder Man find them? With sweet talk and brains? No. He did it with souvenirs. He took them into private rooms, swapped goodies: pictures, panties, jewelry, body parts. Snuff downloads. As bait. That's why I never exchanged with him. He killed girls, oh yeah, harvested them. He had the best stuff. Richard Low is Murman and Murman is one of us.

1 Hi.	Hi.
2 I'm Mike.	Hi, Mike. I'm Lorraine.
3 Like the quiche?	Yes. Like the quiche.
4 I like quiche.	I thought real men don't like quiche.
5 My reputation seems to have preceded me.	Why? You're not a real man?
6 Not lately.

1 I'm considering taking a job as a "Goofy".	Hey, man. At least it's Disney.

1 The poor thing. Six years?	...And she's with someone else.
2 The poor thing. I'll make some coffee.

1 Can I check my messages? I have a calling card.	Sure, I guess. The phone's in the back.

1 How's it going? It's been a while...	...Six months.
2 How are you doing?	Fine... I guess. You?
3 Good.  I think about things.	Yeah?
4 Yeah.	What kind of things?
5 You know, us.	I thought you met someone else.
6 It doesn't matter. I think about you every day.	Really?
7 I miss you, Mike.	Why didn't you call?
8 I couldn't. Do you know how hard it's been not to call you? I pick up the phone every night. Whenever that commercial comes on...	...the Michelin commercial...
9 ...Yeah, with the baby in the tire. One time I started to cry right in front of Pierre...	Pierre... That's his name? Pierre? Is he French?
10 No, he's not... Listen I don't want to talk about him. That's a whole other headache. I called because I heard you might be moving back to Queens...

1 I'll get a Dewars rocks... 	Bud.
2 ...A Dewars on the rocks and a Bud, please.

1 You want to talk about it?	What's the point?
2 It's been two days. You should call that girl Nikki...

1 Pause it. 	Give me the money. I'll get it.

1 Yeah. Here it's easier to avoid trouble. It's not like you like in Compton where bullets are whizzing by your head every day. Nobody's mugging you on no subway. In New York the trouble finds you. Out here you gotta go look for it...	...People get carjacked...

1 Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. 	Hi, Nikki. Mike. I don't think this is working out. I think you're great, but maybe we should just take some time off from each other. It's not you, really. It's me. It's only been six months...
2 Mike?	Nikki! Great! Did you just walk in, or were you listening all along?
3 Don't call me ever again.	Wow, I guess you were home... 

1 Wake up, baby.	Whu?
2 Look at it, baby. Vegas, baby!

1 That was so fuckin' money. It was like that "Jedi mind" shit.	That's what I'm telling you, baby. The babies love that stuff. They don't want all that sensitive shit. You start talking to them about puppy dogs and ice cream. They know what you want. What do you think? You think they don't?
2 I know. I know.	They know what you want, believe me. Pretending is just a waste of time. You're gonna take them there eventually anyway. Don't apologize for it.
3 I'm just trying to be a gentleman, show some respect...	Respect, my ass. They respect honesty. You see how they dress when they go out? They want to be noticed. You're just showing them it's working. You gotta get off this respect kick, baby. There ain't nothing wrong with letting them now that you're money and that you want to party.

1 I wish the game still had fights so I could bitch-slap Wayne.	This version doesn't have fighting?
2 No. Doesn't that suck?	What? That was the best part of the old game.

1 Was I money?	I don't know. It was kind of a dick move if you ask me.
2 Why, baby? What'd I do wrong?	You asked her for her number, and then you tore it up.
3 She didn't see.	That doesn't matter.

1 Bitch... You little bitch!	Chelios to Roenick...!

1 It's on.	You think?
2 Baby, I know it is. It's a black diamond trail...	...double diamond...
3 ...but it's worth the risk. True or false: It's worth the risk.	True.

1 ...Sue...	Have you gotten laid once since you moved here? Did you fuck once?
2 ...Shut up, Sue...	I know for a fact you haven't, because you never shut up about it. You're like a little whiney bitch...
3 Sue!

1 Anything...Anything the Godfather wishes.	Good.  He never doubted you.
2 The Don himself is coming to me tonight?	Yes. 

1 You fingered Sonny for the Barzini people.  That little farce you played out with my sister.  Did Barzini kid you that would fool a Corleone?	I swear I'm innocent.  I swear on the head of my children, I'm innocent.  Mike, don't do this to me, please Mike, don't do this to me!
2 Barzini is dead.  So is Philip Tattaglia, so are Strachi, Cuneo and Moe Greene...I want to square all the family accounts tonight. So don't tell me you're innocent; admit what you did.

1 Sollozzo knows Mike's a civilian.	OK, but be careful.

1 You think we'll go for that last place?	Maybe, or you gotta know now.
2 Holy cow, I don't gotta know nothing.

1 He's his own boss, and very competent.	And with prison record.
2 Two terms; one in Italy, one in the United States.  He's known to the Government as a top narcotics man. That could be a plus for us; he could never get immunity to testify.	When did he call?
3 This morning.	On a day like this.  Consiglero, do you also have in your notes the the Turk made his living from Prostitution before the war, like the Tattaglias do now.  Write that down before you forget it.  The Turk will wait.

1 I told you that it wouldn't escape his eye.	How did you find out?

1 Get the car.  I'll be leaving in ten minutes.  Where's Calo?	Calo is having a cup of coffee in the kitchen.  Is your wife coming with you?
2 No, she's going home to her family. She'll join me in a few weeks...

1 The old man wants you; Johnny's here...he's got a problem.	Okay.  One minute.

1 We'll let the old man take it easy for a couple of weeks.  I want to get things going good before he gets better.  What's the matter with you?	You start operating, the five families will start their raids again.  We're at a stalemate Sonny, your war is costing us a lot of money.
2 No more stalemate Tom, we got the soldiers, we'll match them gun for gun if that's how they want it. They know me for what I am, Tom-- and they're scared of me.	Yes.  That's true, you're getting a hell of a reputation.
3 Well it's war!  We might not be in this shape if we had a real war- time Consiglere, a Sicilian.  Pop had Genco, who do I have?  Hey Tom, hey...hey.  It's Sunday, we're gonna have dinner.  Don't be sore.

1 What about McCluskey?	Let's say now that we have to kill McCluskey.  We'll clear that up through our Newspaper contacts later.

1 If he's your brother, why does he have a different name?	My brother Sonny found him living in the streets when he was a kid, so my father took him in.  He's a good lawyer.

1 Visiting hour ends at eight thirty. I'll just sit with him; I want to show respect.	Can I go to the hospital with you?
2 I don't think so.  You don't want to end up on page 3 of the Daily News.	My parents don't read the Daily News.  All right, if you think I shouldn't.  I can't believe the things the papers are printing. I'm sure most of it's not true.
3 I don't think so either.  I better go.	When will I see you again?
4 I want you to go back to New Hampshire...think things over.

1 All right, Mikey...who do we have to hit, Clemenza or Paulie?	What?
2 One of them fingered the old man.

1 I'm glad you came, Mike.  I hope we can straighten everything out.  All this is terrible, it's not the way I wanted things to happen at all. It should never have happened.	I want to settle things tonight.  I want my father left alone.
2 He won't be; I swear to you be my children he won't be.  Just keep an open mind when we talk.  I hope you're not a hothead like your brother, Sonny.  It's impossible to talk business with him.

1 Mike, good to see you.  Got everything you want?	Thanks.
2 The chef cooked for you special; the dancers will kick your tongue out and you credit is good!  Draw chips for all these people so they can play on the house.	Is my credit good enough to buy you out?

1 I'll do it. I make a fabulous martini.	Everybody should have one talent.  What's yours?

1 He's drowning me!	It's always the same whenever someone new comes into his life -- Freddie, Fausto, Peter Smith-Kingsley -- he's wonderful -- did you meet him, he's a musician? -- ...and especially you, of course... and that's only the boys.

1 Bird! Ask me the name of my sailboat --	I don't know. What's the name of your sailboat?
2 Bird!

1 Do you have any brothers?	No, no brothers, no sisters.
2 Me neither. Nor does Marge. All only children -- what does that mean?

1 I'm thinking of giving up the sax, what do you think about drums?	What?
2 So cool.

1 Of course, he's been very involved in his music, hasn't he? I think his theory is, you know, you have to go into a cocoon before you can become a butterfly.	Which is horseshit. Have you heard him play that thing?  He can't.
2 How did you find him? It's such an out of the way apartment. Can I fix you a drink?	No thanks.  Some kid at the American Express Office.  Are you living here?

1 I'm going to take Marge for a little walk, Tom. Mr MacCarron wants to talk with you.	We could go down to the bar -- no need for you to --
2 No, he should talk to you alone.

1 You were right about the telephones. There are no lines, there's some problem.	Hello Tom. You're off? What are your plans?
2 Back, I suppose, slowly as I can.

1 Dickie!	I'll go and see what's the matter.
2 I'll go.

1 I was looking forward to seeing him.	Dickie hasn't killed himself. I'm sure of that. There's a private detective on the case now -- a Mr MacCarron -- Dickie's father's employing him.
2 That's a terrific idea.	He's American. He's already discovered Dickie cashed checks for $1000 the day before he disappeared.

1 But I hope that note goes to New York in your purse, for a rainy day.	What are you going to do now, Tom?
2 I don't know. Peter has a concert in Athens next month -- and he's asked if I want to go along, help out. He says goodbye by the way -- he's in rehearsal, otherwise --	Why do I think there's never been a Ripley rainy day?
3 What?	I know it was you -- I know it was you, Tom. I know it was you. I know you killed Dickie. I know it was you.
4 Oh Marge.

1 What's funny?	No, nothing. I'm just thinking about when Tom arrived in Mongi.  And now look at you.

1 Will you meet me tomorrow? Just to say goodbye in the daylight, properly? So it's not just this, it's too... you should always save pain for daylight...	Oh Meredith, I'm sorry. Of course I'll meet you. Let's have coffee in the morning at Dinelli's.
2 I don't -- is that by the Spanish Steps?	Exactly. 10.30 -- 

1 Ditto.	Where are you hiding him? He's impossible, isn't he?

1 What did he say?	He says so many fiances.

1 How was it?	Good. But I think we should stay in here for the rest of the trip.
2 Was that Meredith?	Was who Meredith?
3 Meredith Logue. You were kissing somebody. Looked like Meredith.	Hardly kissing. Kissing off.
4 Didn't look that way -- you know -- from a distance.	I lied. To her. She thought she'd seen you.
5 Why lie?	Dickie and Peter, that's just too good gossip, isn't it?
6 Or Tom and Peter even.	Well that would be even better gossip.
7 Really, why?  Sorry, I'm completely lost.	I know. I'm lost, too. I'm going to be stuck in the basement, aren't I, that's my, that's my -- terrible and alone and dark -- and I've lied about who I am, and where I am, and so nobody can ever find me.
8 What do you mean lied about who you are?	I suppose I always thought -- better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody.
9 What are you talking about -- you're not a nobody! That's the last thing you are.	Peter, I... I...
10 And don't forget. I have the key.	You have the key. Tell me some good things about Tom Ripley. Don't get up. Just tell me some nice things.

1 You got a .44 Magnum?	That's an expensive gun.
2 I got money.

1 We've signed up 15,000 Palantine volunteers in New York so far. The organizational problems are becoming just staggering.	I know what you mean. I've got the same problems. I just can't get things organized. Little things, I mean. Like my room, my possessions. I should get one of those signs that says, "One of these days I'm gonna get organezizied"

1 This is sort of high class...	I mean porno movies.
2 Well... mostly...	My God!
3 We can go to another movie if you like, I don't care. I got money. There's plenty...

1 Well, if Cronkite's so great, why don't we run him instead?	That's the last. The finish. Period. Some people can learn. Some people can't. And you wonder why we never get serious --
2 Sure we could run him. You realize he's already head of his block association.	Have you been noticing anything strange?
3 No, why?	Why's that taxi driver across the street been staring at us?
4 What taxi driver?	That taxi driver. The one that's been sitting here.
5 How long has he been there?	I don't know -- but it feels like a long time.

1 She stayed in the cab, what's she gonna do? But she stiffed me. A real skunk.	A real skunk.

1 20 bucks?	Yeah. Hey thanks. That's real nice, Travis.

1 Well, you want to or not?	O.K. It's a date. I'll see you here, then.

1 Say, aren't you Charles Palantine, the candidate?	Yes I am.
2 Well, I'm one of your biggest supporters. I tell everybody that comes in this cab that they should vote for you.	Why, thank you Travis.
3 I'm sure you'll win, sir. Everybody I know is going to vote for you.  I was going to put one of your stickers on my taxi but the company said it was against their policy.	I'll tell you, Travis, I've learned more about this country sitting in taxi cabs than in the board room of General Motors.

1 Is that so?	What kind of guns do you guys use? .38's?

1 Wiz?	Yeah?
2 Look, ah, we never talked much, you and me...	Yeah?
3 I wanted to ask you something, on account you've been around so long.	Shoot. They don't call me the Wizard for nothing.
4 Well, I just, you know...	Things got ya down?
5 Real down.	It happens.
6 Sometimes it gets so I just don't know what I'm gonna do. I get some real crazy ideas, you know? Just go out and do somethin.	The taxi life, you mean.
7 Yeah.	I know.
8 Like do anything, you know.	Travis, look, I dig it. Let me explain. You choose a certain way of life. You live it. It becomes what you are. I've been a hack 27 years, the last ten at night. Still don't own my own cab. I guess that's the way I want it.  You see, that must be what I am.

1 Spit it out.	MY girlfriend's pregnant.

1 I.don't get it.  You're going to help me?	No. I'm going to give you dancing lessons.  What the fuck do you think?

1 God's speed.	Yes.  To wish someone a prosperous jouey.

1 Not exactly light reading, I know. Believe it or not, I've read this since high school, and it got me all the way through law school. Besides, there's something in there that'll help you.  You won't have to get very far, it's near the beginning.	Delly... thanks, thank you.  I'll take good care of this.
2 Just remember two things.  First, the law is a living thing.  It made us free and it keeps us free. Sometimes it gets twisted around by people for their own purposes. Sometimes it makes mistakes, sometimes big mistakes.  But in the end, the law prevails for the just. Sometimes, it takes a while.	Okay.  What's the second thing?

1 What.	No, I... I just wondering where you've been all this time.
2 Me too.	You look... different.
3 I do?	Yeah, a little.  I think you grew an inch or so.  And you've lost weight.
4 I did?  Huh!

1 What was that?	Nothing.  
2 Do you have the...	I'm  fine.  Really.  

1 What... do you remember?	Well... everything.  It started coming back a couple of days ago. I remember everything now.
2 I see...	Delly.  I'm... I'm not... Harry wasn't my father.  And I'm not... I'm not Luke.

1 Yes.  A prepared statement.	Um... no.  I don't have a statement at this time.

1 Doc, with your permission, I want to bring someone in here.  Maybe it'll jar this young man's memory.	By all means.

1 You never came back from the war. We were told you were missing and presumed dead.	When did I leave?
2 You joined up one month to the day after Pearl Harbor.  January seventh... nineteen forty-two.

1 Yes?	"one fryer and two-dozen eggs?"
2 Forty-two was a lean year around here.  The war had just started... you were gone less than a month... and we were coming off a bit of a drought as I recall.  Not everyone could ante up the price of a ticket, and a chicken's as good as money if you ask me.  At that time, it meant a lot to the folks around here to be able to come to the pictures.	Yeah, I know, but poultry...?
3 I know it's hard to believe, son, but this place, this little place this wasn't a theater then, this was a palace!  Any man, woman, child, you, me, it didn't matter, you bought your ticket and you walked in and you...

1 Jesus...	The film broke...
2 I know, I know... keep still.

1 Here, one of mine.	Thanks.

1 You smell gas?	Don't smell nothin'.  He must not be dead in here.
2 Jesus.	Hey, it's the best way to tell.

1 Peter, I'm an agent.  I buy lunches and get deals made for guys like you.  That's what I do.  You're a writer.  You write pictures. That's what you do.  And trust me, you'll be back doing it again tomorrow morning.	What do you mean?
2 Kid, you gave them what they wanted.  This committee, it feeds on names.  The more names, the better.  But for some high-profile witnesses, like yourself, any name will do.	Leo, I didn't give them the names. I wouldn't do that.
3 What, all of a sudden, "Lucille Angstrom" isn't a name?

1 That's my r-r-rent.	Oh.

1 Ancestors?	Actually, my grandpap.  But "ancestors" sounds better, don't it?  Here.

1 Are you a friend of Mitch's?	No, not really.

1 No, thank you.  Won't you call me Melanie?	All right. 

1 Mother!	If your father were here...

1 Yeah, but she'll be hitting all that traffic going back to San Francisco.	Did you put the cover on that cage, Mom?

1 Are you sure?	Well, I ain't positive, if that's what you mean.
2 I need her exact name, you see.	That case, I tell you what you do. You go straight through town 'til you see a little hotel on your left there. Not the motel, that's the other end of town. This is the hotel. Now you take a right turn there, you got that?
3 Yes?	Near the top of the hill, you'll see the school and right behind it, the church. You head for the school. Now just past the school, you'll see a little house with a red mail box. That's where Annie Hayworth lives, she's the school teacher. You ask her about the little Brenner girl.
4 Thank you.	Yep.  Could save yourself a lot of trouble. Her name's Alice for sure.
5 Can I have the boat in about twenty minutes?

1 We don't have any fog this time of year, Mitch.	We'll make our own fog.

1 He sold the feed to me, didn't he?	Caviat emptor, Mother. Let the buyer beware.
2 Whose side are you on?	I'm simply quoting the law.
3 Never mind the law. Cathy, you can start serving the soup.

1 I'm not very good at this, Mitch.	You're doing fine.
2 I mean. I want to...

1 Please don't mess me up with bandages, Mrs. Brenner.	Shhhh. Shhhh.
2 Please.

1 He won't be back until Monday. I mean, if those birds are for him....	Monday?
2 Yes. I don't think you should leave them in the hall, do you?	Well, I...

1 Ouch!	I'm sorry.  What are you doing up here?
2 Didn't you see the lovebirds?	You came all the way up here to bring me those birds?
3 To bring your sister those birds. You said it was her birthday. Besides, I was coming up anyway.	What for?
4 To see a friend of mine.  Will you please be careful?	I'm sorry.  Who's your friend?
5 Why... 	Yes?
6 Annie. Annie Hayworth.	Well, well, small world. Annie Hayworth.
7 Yes.	How do you know Annie?
8 We... we went to school together. College.	Did you! Imagine that! How long will you be staying?
9 Just a few... just a day or two... the weekend.	I think we'll have to shave the hair. Deke, have you got a razor?
10 Oh, no you don't!	It's still bleeding a little. Here, let me put this on.

1 That might have been good enough in Rome last summer. But it's not good enough now.	It is for me.
2 But not for me.	What do you want ?
3 I thought you knew! I want to go through life laughing and beautiful and jumping into fountains naked! Good night!

1 It all started several months ago with a peasant sparrow up in the hills, a malcontent. He went around telling all the other sparrows that human beings weren't fit to rule this planet, preaching wherever anyone would listen...	Growing a beard...
2 Yes, of course, he had to have a beard! 'Birds of the world, unite!' he kept saying, over and over...	So they united.
3 Not at first. Oh yes, a few sparrows out for kicks...	Well, they'll go along with anything.
4 Sure. But eventually, even the more serious-minded birds began to listen. "Why should humans rule?" they asked themselves.	Hear!
5 Why should we submit ourselves to their domination?	Hear, hear!
6 And all the while, that sparrow was getting in his little messages. Birds of the world, unite!	Take wing!
7 You have nothing to lose but your feathers.

1 Where are they heading?	Inland.
2 Santa Rosa?	Maybe.

1 There we are!	Oh, good! Oh, wonderful.

1 I don't know why.	I thought not. Birds have been on this planet since archaeopteryx, Miss Daniels; a hundred and twenty million years ago!

1 Birds?	Yeah, birds. All they do is make a mess of everything. Who needs them?
2 We need them.	Not if they're starting a war.
3 They are incapable of organized warfare!

1 I'm Donald Fettes.	I'm very pleased to know you, Master Fettes.
2 Mr. Gray?	That's right.  Gray, the cabman. I've had a bit of dealing with MacFarlane in the past, you know.

1 It's not because of Georgina -- because of Dr. MacFarlane's failure?	It's not the failure. I feel that MacFarlane has taught me nothing. He taught me the mathematics of anatomy but he couldn't teach me the poetry of medicine.

1 I'm afraid I'll have to give up medicine, Dr. MacFarlane.	You're made for a doctor, young man!
2 I'm afraid I have to, sir.  You see, my father is vicar at Thrums -- it's a small parish -- not much of a living --	You're too good a man, Fettes -- I'll not let you quit.  I'll make an assistant of you -- that'll pay your keep and your tuition, too --
3 I thought only the best students were made assistants.	Well? And are you not a good student?
4 But Richardson?	Richardson is a fine student.  He's got a glib tongue, but you'll be a better doctor, Fettes.  Come along now --

1 I don't know that -- neither do you.  This subject may have been an epileptic -- thrown a fit -- fallen out of bed -- cracked her skull and killed herself -- there is everything explained -- the bruise on her head --	I can't believe that.
2 Believe it or not.  It's best for you to pretend that you do.  After all, it was you who ordered this specimen, received it here, and paid for it.  That makes you a party to murder.

1 Where shall we put it? In the back?	No room there. We'll have to set it between us.

1 You'll not need that again, Georgina.	I wanted to see the white horse --

1 Now that wasn't a friendly thing I heard, Toddy.  Not at all friendly.	That has nothing to do with it. We've decided to do more lecturing and less dissection -- it's better for the students -- that's all there is to it.
2 You know what you want and don't want -- so that's an end of business between us -- but we'll still be friends, Toddy.  I'll be dropping by to see you and Meg once in a while -- for auld lang syne, you know.	I suppose we can't prevent that, Gray --  -- for auld lang syne.

1 Surely you are not threatening an old friend, Toddy.	We have never been friends.

1 I have made you give me money, but you smile. Aren't you angry?	No, Joseph. I'm not angry -- here -- another glass of brandy --I'll wager it's better than the doctor's.

1 I'm sorry, Doctor.  Georgina's a good child -- a brave child -- you saw how she was during the operation -- but if she can't move, she can't move.	But she must be able to move. Everything is in place.
2 She would if she could.	Then all my surgery is no good. There's something wrong with the child -- something I don't know -- something I can't define -- can't diagnose.  I can do nothing for her.

1 It was one thing her dad rejected you. But when she did you lost it.	You're wrong.
2 Yeah?  I see doubt oozing out your arm. Where do people go when they kill their girlfriends?

1 Think maybe knives do?	Keep that thing away from me.
2 This is not just some "thing." It's A C zero zero five.

1 You're him! You're Corvis! We fried your ass. You're dead, man!	Good thing in a situation like this.

1 I know who you are.  That's why you paint your face. To hide.	I'm not hiding. I'm right here.
2 You killed Lauren! You killed her!

1 It's ok, it's ok...	It's not. I can't take it.
2 Erin. Who?	I don't know. I found him lying there.

1 Just don't believe everything you see.	Doubt is a motherfucker.
2 Give me a hand with this sack of shit.

1 Why are there so many?	Just hold on to me.

1 I would never hurt you or Lauren. Never. Believe me.	I don't believe you.
2 Please. Come inside.	I'm never going back in that house again. Get away.

1 The people who came to the meeting must be made to realize this. They must understand what is at stake.  You mentioned a demonstration of force--	Yes.
2 Would such, a demonstration be possible before the meeting?	Yes -- of course.
3 Something that would dramatize for them and for their people the seriousness of the situation. Something that would affect the entire planet.	That can easily be arranged.
4 I wouldn't want you to harm anybody -- or destroy anything.	Why don't you leave it to me? I'll think of something.
5 Maybe a little demonstration.	Something dramatic -- but not destructive.  It's quite an interesting problem.  Would day after tomorrow be all right? Say about noon?

1 Bobby--! What are you doing up at this hour?	I couldn't go to sleep, Mom. I had to tell you!
2 Tell me what?	I followed Mr. Carpenter -- right after you left -- and, gee, Mom, where do you think he went? Right into the space ship!
3 Now, Bobby, just a minute--	Honest, Mom, I saw him. It just opened up and he walked right in. And that great big iron man was moving around!
4 Bobby, you've been dreaming again.	No, I haven't, Mom. I promise you... I saw it!

1 Maybe four thousand miles an hour. And outside the Earth's atmosphere a good deal faster.	Gee! How could they make a landing?
2 Well -- there are several ways to reduce landing speed. You see, the velocity--

1 We certainly did.	We went to the movies -- and we had ice cream cones -- and we went to see Daddy--

1 I'm sure you recognize from our broad- casts the evil forces that have produced the tension in our world. Surely you would agree--	I am not concerned, Mr. Harley, with the internal affairs of your planet. I consider that to be your business -- not mine.
2 I was only hoping to make you understand.	My mission here is not to solve your petty squabbles. It concerns the existence of every last creature who lives on Earth.
3 Perhaps if you could explain a little--	I intend to explain. To all the nations -- simultaneously.  How do we proceed, Mr. Harley?

1 He's not there.  But look what I found in his room	Is it real?
2 Looks real to me.

1 Mr. Carpenter -- this is none of my business, but -- why did that detective come here last night?	Oh -- they just wanted to ask me a few questions. Bobby and I tried to see Professor Barnhardt in the afternoon, but he wasn't in. Apparently they thought I was looking for secrets of some kind.

1 It must be twelve-thirty.	Yes -- Just exactly.

1 The Professor's secretary says she found you in Barnhardt's room, making marks on his blackboard.	I was only trying to be helpful. He was having difficulty with a problem.

1 I don't like horror comics.	Think of this more as a survival manual... there's our number on the back, and pray that you never need to call us.
2 I'm gonna pray that I never need to call you.

1 All together?	Zero.

1 We were gonna grab some food.	Good idea.  Marko.  We're hungry.

1 Look.	You're almost one of us now, Michael.

1 He's telling the truth!  Aren't you, Michael?	To free you, we must destroy the leader of the vampires.

1 Don't go out there!  Stop him!	Sam, don't --

1 Grandpa, the Widow Johnson called. She said to pick her up a seven instead of eight.	Did we have a date tonight?
2 I guess so.  She said not to be late.	I better get cleaned up, then.

1 Okay?	Okay.

1 He met a girl.	I guess no one cares what I got a job.
2 Can we get a T.V.?

1 Ohmygod...	Mom!
2 What happened?  Is everybody all right?!

1 Maybe this is the night where everything finally goes right for a change.	I hope so.

1 Hi...	If you want your ear pierced, I'll do it.

1 You've got to put this on.	Take laddie.
2 Huh?	Save Laddie first.

1 Do I have to do this?	Come on, Sam, you know before there were malls there was 'like the ocean.'

1 What happened, Michael!?	Nanook...
2 What about Nonook?  What have you done to Nanook?!  What have you done to my dog, you asshole?!	Nothing!  I didn't hurt him.  <u>He</u> bit <u>me</u>!  This is <u>my</u> blood!

1 What do you want from us?	Just listen.

1 Was that dog, the Norwegian dog?	I just can't comprehend any of this. It was just a dog.

1 ... Can't you see...?  If one cell of this Thing got out it could imitate every living thing on Earth. Nothing could stop it!  Nothing!	Look Blair, maybe you're right about this.  But we've got to be rational. We've got to talk this over.  I'm unarmed and I'm coming in.
2 No, you're not!  I don't trust any of you!

1 Why didn't it imitate Fuchs?  Isn't that its number -- to get more recruits.	Wasn't enough time.  Generator was out, what...?  Thirty minutes. Takes the bastards an hour, maybe two to absorb somebody.

1 Somebody's taken it.  I can't find it!	Clark, you want me to come in after you?!

1 Torch them!!	But...
2 He's gone already!  Do it!

1 We should have jumped his ass.	Now Copper, you tie Palmer up.

1 What are you doing?	Could be important work.  Might as well bring it back.
2 It's getting late.  Hurry it.  I'm going to check the last few rooms.

1 Can there be... some kind of test? To find out who's what?	A serum test possibly.

1 We're on fire!	Don't let up, Childs!
2 Extinguishers.

1 Oh, I got you.  Not too long.	Then get a move on.  Childs, come with me.

1 We've got to find Fuchs.  When we find him -- we kill him.	Why?
2 If he's one of those Things, we've got to get to him before he changes... Nauls, you and Childs and I'll check the outside shacks...

1 You and Nauls got to block off the west side bunks, the mess hall and the kitchen.	You crazy?  He might be inside already?
2 Chance we got to take.  We got to force him to come down the east side to the door we got rigged.

1 You hear that?	Hear what?

1 No one ever comes here.  My mother told me stories about it late at night.  They tell all the children.	What kind of stories?
2 About the voice in the darkness. About the ghosts...

1 Because you'll never die.	Excuse me?
2 You'll live like this forever. Alone.  You were meant to help.  To be with people.  Not like this.

1 Alexander... Listen to me, it was wrong to bring you.  You're not going to find what you're looking for.	What do you mean?
2 Trust me... You don't want to see any more.

1 Say I just come back again?	Alexander, yours is a world of brocade and velvet, not tooth and claw.  Why would you come back to this?  To save a few cattle?  No.
2 I could tell them.  Warm them of what's to come.

1 God -- could have killed me -- bad girl, Nell!  How did you know to do that?	I just love mechanical things.
2 Well, much obliged -- I'm always forgetting the confounded brake -- say, if you wait until I get her up and running I'll give you a perambulation.  Tell you all about her.	Ahhh... I'm afraid I've got a prior commitment.
3 Next time then.  We perambulate here most every night.	You have my word...  ... She's just a beauty.

1 Alex, what is it?	Holding you... again.
2 Darling.	I need... to talk to you.
3 All right...	Not here... alone.  Please.

1 Alex... people are staring.	Let them.

1 I've been working.	I came by the house every day after the funeral.  And then every week. Then every other month.  Then I stopped coming.  Did you even notice?
2 I'm sorry, David.	It hurt me, Alex.  Very much.
3 Then why are you here?

1 Couldn't help but overhearing.  Two fine young people starting out on the road of life.  I wish you the very best.	Thank you...
2 I hope it's a happy journey for you both -- and much as I hate to do this, moved as I am by your protestations of love, I'll be needing your money now.	Sir...?
3 And your jewelry too.  I guess we could consider this your first little bump on the road to married bliss.	I don't understand.

1 Oh, that explains everything.	I know it's hard to believe, but it's true.
2 That machine --	Allowed me to travel from my time to yours.
3 How long ago?	More than 800,000 years.

1 The mud carriers.	I can see Kalen's point.
2 Want to be a high climber now, do you?	What you need is an engineer.  If you set up a system of pulleys and counterweights, some basic block and tackle mechanism, you could to this a lot more easily.
3 It's not supposed to be easy, it's supposed to be beautiful.	What's it all for?
4 I don't understand.	I mean, why do you do it?  What purpose does it serve?
5 It has no purpose.  It's just beautiful... Does everything have a purpose where you come from?	Most things.  We're very high on purpose.
6 It's always been this way here.  We work on the towers all our lives. When we're young we train to be planners or climbers or sculptors...	Or mud carriers.
7 And there's no shame to that.  It's all the same here.  Everyone has an important job to do.  We all work together and couldn't survive without each other.	What are you?
8 I'm a planner.  I help decide where the new towers go and what they should look like.	How do you decide?
9 I try to imagine how they'll look when they're done.  I try to imagine how we'll fit in with them... our place in the world.

1 It was different then.	My laboratory was about... here. And the kitchen was over there, where that tree is.  Mrs. Watchit wouldn't allow me in much... but, yes, this is about the kitchen.

1 With respect, sir, would we have the telegraph without fantasy? Would we have radium and X-rays without someone first dreaming we could?	The advances you speak of were the result of countless years of study and empirical experimentation, a careful evolutionary process, not chalkboard parlor-tricks.
2 My equations are not parlor-tricks!	Abstract mathematics, relativity of dimensions, geometrical "durations" -- even allowing for the uses of speculation, what is the point?
3 Because it's a new way of seeing the world!  Of seeing our place in it!

1 You won't even try?	We can't change the day and the night, Alexander.  This is the world.

1 I wonder if that poor girl has any idea what she's in for?	For our sake, I hope not.

1 We were forced to use restrains if that's what you're referring to.	That wasn't a fucking restraint.
2 Actually, that's exactly what our equipment is.

1 Who are you?	I think you know. Your eyes say you do.
2 [Beat] You're his son?	No. I'm not his son. I'm him. [Beat] What? You look like you've seen a ghost. You can come here and touch me, old man. I'm the real thing.
3 How...how are you here?

1 He died because he bled to death from a blow to his head. Someone had to have given him it.	I never touched your father! I swear!

1 Get your fucking hands off my daughter!	Mom, he just fixed our car.
2 Jackie, get in the car. NOW!

1 Jackie, I'm William Starks. I can prove it.	What? Now you're gonna show me some kind of driver's license?
2 No, I don't have anything to show you. I'm here from a mental hospital.	Well, you belong in one.

1 I didn't kill Officer Harrison.	I know.
2 How? Did they figure it out after I died?	No. They never figured it out. I did. Most murderers don't stop to help a drunk woman and her little girl on the side of the road. Not without hurting them.

1 Of course he will. [Beat] What day of the week is it?	It's Sunday.

1 [Beat] You be good to yourself, Jackie.	Ok.

1 My God you look exactly like him.	I never knew my father. Did you?
2 Yeah, I did. [Beat] He was my most memorable patient.	Why?

1 You don't understand.	Then help me understand. You know, you're not alone. A lot of Gulf Vets have begun to experience curious symptoms. What you have might well be a syndrome and, if so, it's not one we know enough about to be treating it this vigorously.
2 This has nothing to do with that.

1 Can I get some paper and something to write with.	What for?

1 I know you need one when it's really cold.	[Cutting in] MacKenzie, listen to me. Listen. I'm going to die.
2 Mortality's actually a great thing to be familiar with. It means you're sane on some level.	[Gravely] No, I mean in four days, I'm supposed to die.
3 [Beat] How do you know?	The Jacket.

1 If you're deaf, read my lips...I don't need a psycho following me today.	[Beat] I'm not deaf.
2 Good.

1 I only lit it because it was so cold in here. I'm sorry if...	No, it's fine. [Beat, swallow] Thanks.

1 I'm sorry.	Yeah, me too. [Softly] Every day for the last ten years.
2 That when you stopped being a nurse?

1 Did either of them ever indicate that they might be running from the Law?	Now that you mention it, they might have been a little bit jumpy.
2 You know what?  You're starting to irritate me.

1 I swear to God, she wouldn't tell me one thing!  Christ!  You oughta try to find that kid that was with 'em.	Tell us about him.
2 Just some young guy.  Around twenty years old.  Dark hair.

1 I'm sorry to bother you, I know you're real busy right now, but how many times, Max?  How many times has that woman gotta be fucked over? You could lift one finger and save her ass and you won't even do that?	Get a hold of yourself!  You are way out of your jurisdiction, now come on!  Calm down!  Don't make me sorry I let you come!

1 This is J.D.  He's a student.  We're just givin' him a ride to... to here.  Louise said we could bring him here and then he'd have to go. And that's what he's doin'.  He's goin'.  Aren't you, J.D.?	Yup.  Thanks for the ride.  You all take care.

1 Louise!  Where are you?  Are you alright?  Honey...	Hi.  I'm okay.  How are you?  Long time no see.
2 Louise, honey... Where are you?  You sound funny.

1 Now, my little coconut, what seems to be the trouble here?  Tell Daddy everything.	Jimmy, my daddy's still alive and it kind of gives me the creeps when you do that...
2 Okay, okay, just tell me what's the trouble.

1 You wanna take it out of your wallet, please?	Oh yeah.

1 Alright...  I changed my mind.  I'll have a margarita with and a shot of Cuervo on the side, please.	Yeah!

1 We have to think this through.  We have to be smart.  Now is not the time to panic.  If we panic now, we're done for.  Nobody saw it. Nobody knows it was us.  We're still okay.  Now all we have to do is just figure out our next move.	Our next move?  I'll say one thing, Louise.  This is some vacation.  I sure am having a good time.  This is real fun.
2 If you weren't so concerned with having a good time, we wouldn't be here right now.	Just what is that supposed to mean?
3 It means shut up, Thelma.	So this is all my fault, is it.

1 I wish we could've brought him with us.	What did Darryl say?
2 He said "Okay, Thelma.  I just wanted to know you were alright.  I hope you're havin' a good time.  You sure deserve one after puttin' up with me all the time.  I love you, honey."

1 Oh, Thelma.  Oh, no.	I mean I finally understand what all the fuss is about.   This is just a whole 'nother ball game!
2 Thelma, please get a hold of yourself.  You're making a spectacle.	You know, Louise, you're supposed to be my best friend.  You could at least be a little bit happy for me. You could at least pretend to be slightly happy that for once in my life I have a sexual experience that isn't completely disgusting.
3 I'm sorry.  I am happy.  I'm very happy for you.  I'm glad you had a good time.  It's about time.  Where is he now?	Taking a shower.
4 You left that guy alone in the room?

1 Besides, what do we say about the robbery?  No excuse for that.  No such thing as justifiable robbery.	Alright, Louise!

1 Look!  Look who it is, Thelma.  I'll be darned.  What's he doin' way out here.	Just ignore him.

1 Sorry!	Sorry!

1 Thelma, that is not an option.	But I don't know... something's crossed over in me and I can't go back.  I mean, I just couldn't live...
2 I know.  I know what you mean.  I don't wanna end up on the damn Geraldo Show.

1 I guess we shoulda made some kinda plan for what to do if we get caught.	Yeah, right.  We're not gonna get caught.

1 Now what?	We're not giving up, Thelma.
2 Then let's not get caught.	What are you talkin' about?
3 Go.	Go?

1 Hey, shit-for-brains, be careful not to scratch that thing, huh?	What?
2 You heard me. You already put a fucking nick in my piano.	I'll try to be more careful.
3 S'matter with you? You look like you're fading.	The thing's kind of heavy.
4 Heavy? Heavy?! What I wouldn't give to know what heavy feels like, you insensitive prick.	No, I just meant...
5 Yeah yeah. I'm going to the corner to get a cup of coffee.

1 Come on, that wouldn't make me gay.	I'm going to fix you up with my new assistant.
2 What's he like?

1 Maybe you're right. I should look on the bright side. I mean, I've still got my health...  I'm out of here. I've got to get up at six a.m. to move my boss's brother into his apartment.	What? On your day off? Do you even know the guy?
2 Never met him.	Jesus, Ted, you've got to finish that damn novel so you can quit that stupid magazine.
3 Amen to that.

1 Okay, sounds like you're all set. Just clean the pipes and it's a go.	Hm?
2 You know, clean the pipes.	Pipes? What are you talking about?
3 You jerk off before all big dates, right? Tell me you jerk off before your big dates.

1 Who?	Big guy -- goes to Barrington high school.

1 Very nice.	I'm doing okay.  I gotta get ready for work.

1 Oh yeah.	Dumbshit.

1 Don't you want to know my name?	I already know it, Mary.
2 How'd you know that?	It's right there on your golf bag.

1 You know, sometimes I wish I could be like Magda and not go home. I'd like to just bounce around for awhile, do a little traveling...	Why bounce when you have your own condo in Nepal to go to?

1 Urrggghh...	Warren!

1 Mary's a little chubby, huh?	I'd say about a deuce, deuce and a half. Not bad.

1 Hey, hey, hey!	Surprised?

1 You know, I really should take your card.	Oh look, it's Doob! Will you excuse me a minute, Tucker?

1 You little fuck.	What?
2 You fucking prick, we had a deal -- you said you wouldn't fuck me and I wouldn't fuck you until we had this fuck out of the fucking picture.  You crossed the line, man.

1 What? Steve seemed to put up with Warren.	I don't want someone who'll put up with him. I want someone who will enjoy him, the way I do. Do you know what he told my friend Tucker? He said he would've popped the question a lot earlier if Warren wasn't in my life.  Well he is in my life and I'm goddamn lucky to have him. The hell with Steve.

1 I'm buying bananas tonight.	Why?
2 Back when I was your age I always used to make myself a big banana split after sex. I think you're gonna need one tonight.	Don't get ahead of yourself. You'll probably need it before I will.

1 You don't think they're too big?	No no, the bigger the better.  But I must say, they could be a little brighter. Nothing's sexier than a mouthful of pearly whites.

1 Uh, well... not exactly. You see, I exaggerated a little there.	You mean he's not a criminal?

1 You asshole, what are you --  Mary! Is that you?	Who's that?

1 Now by killer, you mean...?	I mean he murdered someone and did time back in Boston. The guy's a freak.
2 Jeez, Mary... I'm...	Well, lucky for me I found out. Thank God I have friends like Tucker.  Look, I'm sick of talking about stalkers.  Let's talk about you.

1 Ted... you're not that far ahead.	Look, Mary, the truth is... I'll be in town for a while now but I don't think we should see each other for a few weeks.
2 Why not?	Well... to be honest... I'm really crazy about you and it's making me nervous and when I get nervous I'm not myself and I'm afraid I'm going to doing something really dumb before we get started so I think I should just lay back until I regain my composure.

1 But but what about Steve?	Oh yeah, that'd make golf real fun -- the guy doesn't even drink beer or gamble.

1 Charlie, that's mean. Come on in, Ted. Don't listen to Mr. Wise Guy here. He's a joke a minute.	Oh.  Oh, that's a good one.

1 Piggyback ride.	I don't mind. If you think he can hold me.

1 I believe the President made it clear that there would be no firing on ships without his express permission.	With all due respect, Mr. Secretary, we were not firing on the ship. Firing on a ship means attacking the ship. We were not attacking the ship. We were firing over it.
2 This was not the President's intention when he gave that order. What if the Soviets don't see the distention? What if they make the same mistake I just did?  There will be no firing anything near ANY Soviet ships without my express permission, is that understood, Admiral?	Yes, sir.
3 And I will only issue such instructions when ordered to by the President.  John Paul Jones... you don't understand a thing, do you, Admiral?

1 Goddamn Stevenson. Jesus. Peace at any price. You'd think nobody learned anything from World War Two.	Somebody had to say it. I respect Adlai for having the guts to risk looking like an appeaser.
2 We have to pull him. He's not going to be able to handle the Soviets in front of the U.N. Zorin will eat him alive.	We've got bigger problems right now.

1 Jesus...	Rescind the order. Can all the Chiefs. Put Nitze, Gilpatric and the Undersecretaries in charge.
2 We can't do that, Bobby.

1 Slow down. Smell that?	Smoke.
2 Just wanted to see for myself.  They're burning their documents.

1 I am instructed to tell you that the American Government would respond favorably to an offer along the lines you have discussed. If this solution were raised at the U.N. by Ambassador Zorin, he would find a favorable reply from Ambassador Stevenson.	So I understand you correctly. If the missiles in Cuba were dismantled, returned to the Soviet Union, and a guarantee was made not to reintroduce them, the United States would be prepared to guarantee that it would never invade Cuba?
2 That is correct.	This is from the Highest Authority?
3 Yes. From the Highest Authority. There are two conditions. The U.N. must be allowed to inspect the removal of the missiles.	And, of course, the U.N. must be allowed to observe the redeployment of forces from the American Southeast.

1 Then we have no choice.  General, issue the warning orders to our forces. They will be prepared to execute the air strikes Monday morning and the follow-on invasion according to the schedule thereafter. I'll need the official release orders on my desk Sunday night.	Understood, sir. We need to step up the overflights, finalize our pilots' target folders in order to be able to carry out the strikes.

1 There are major rail disruptions in the South, two airborne divisions are on alert. That exercise is an invasion.	Well, you know how Bobby has it in for the State of Mississippi.
2 This is about Cuba.

1 Okay. Kenny and I only show for the meetings you call us into. Impress us. And do it fast.  You're in charge of keeping this quiet. If word gets out before we know what we're going to do, there'll be panic. And it'll ruin any chance of surprise if we decide to hit them.	Then we need to do a few things right away. No Pierre. He knows, the press knows. You're going to have to keep up your schedule -- your movements are followed too closely. And we need to get these guys out of the White House. George Ball's got a conference room at State.  Reconvene over there this afternoon, come back here tonight.

1 That's going to be tough. You know how these guys are about their chains of command...	Any problems, you remind them those chains of commands end at one place. Me.

1 You must think I'm blind and stupid. I've already gotten the birds and bees from Bobby. The President doesn't have to double-barrel me.	Listen to me, goddamn it. We're talking about a possible nuclear war. You dropped the ball on Bay of Pigs --
2 -- you sonofabitch, goddamn it, I didn't drop --	You were in the room. It was your purview. It was your job to make sure Bissel wasn't fucking us over and you didn't do it. You've got the most important job in the world right now. You're the smartest guy the President has.  Besides me.

1 Yeah.	You're my hero, Carl.
2 Heroes ain't supposed to shake. I'm shakin', man, look at me.	Breathe, Carl. Four, nice, deep ones.

1 What's this about?	Your good friend Leo Fast Elk.
2 You think I killed him? Cuz he was an apple? Well, let me tell you something about Leo, Man --	-- don't "man" me, Jimmy. Where's the key?

1 Somebody must be doing something somewhere in your jurisdiction, Officer Crow Foot.	You ain't gonna cut his hands off and send 'em to Washinton, are ya? They done that to one of our girls once. Leo did quillwork, he's gonna need his hands.

1 This is a restricted area.	Check him out, Ray.

1 Who is he?	One of the leaders of the Warriors of All Red Nations. Militant organization.

1 Genetic ditto on evidence found at the site with evidence you found in his belongings. An incontrovertible motive. And definite footprints on Jimmy Looks Twice at Maisy Blue Legs house.	When did we get that?
2 Today. And now you -- there's a dog in the van --	-- I know. I fed it, and I can't get rid of --
3 You weren't sent here to go off on your own detail, Ray. You were sent here to assist in a Selective Operations Unit. These regional agents are inept -- that's why they were sent out here to The Graveyard, to Indian Country. I need you behind me, Ray. Not pulling against me.	I'm not trying to pull against you, Cooch. I've just been having nightmares about the way Leo was killed.
4 Your first homicide, that's gonna happen, Ray...	I just wanna make sure no one else gets done in that way because we were in bed with the wrong doer.
5 Ray. I never get into bed with somebody unless I know for sure. Just the way I was raised.

1 This was a Selective Operations Unit, Agent Levoi. There is classified information pertaining to our national security. You don't question that, you don't go digging into that shit -- that's insubordination. Jesus Christ --	-- if they mine uranium there, these people will have no place left to go...
2 We were sworn in on the Constitution to protect federal matters, Ray. I don't know about uranium, I don't know about Red Dog Table -- all I know is we did our job. It's over.	We neutralized anybody with a voice. Leo, Jimmy... Eagle Bear. Anyone who was standing in the way of the land. Is that it?
3 No. We neutralized enemies of the United States. Anti-American radicals who have killed federal officers out here!

1 Grandpa Samuel Reaches. Heavy duty medicine.	Medicine. As in medicine man?

1 Don't be mad. That was just an old traditional gesture that means hello, how are you.	I see. Forgive my cultural ignorance.

1 Agent Little Weasel, Federal Bura of your Imagination.	Jesus Christ. You're hammered. What are you doing?
2 You're right about the old man. His power's long dried up. He's supposed to be a medicine man but he won't go see the people. He says we changed, and we don't listen. Well, he don't go out and talk no more. I haven't had a drink in three years but I just turned my sobriety chip into that man behind the bar, and this Hoss is gettin' watered.	Cut the shit. You shouldn't be in here, Man.
3 Cuz I'm a skin?	Cuz you're a cop.
4 Not no more.	What are you talking about?
5 You tell me. You tell me who went to the B.I.A. -- Bureau of Indian Annihilation and said I was messin' with your case, man. I don't give a goddamn about your case.	And I don't give a goddamn about whether you wear a badge or not, Crow Horse, but I didn't cut you.

1 Jesus. Oil?	Uranium. Test holes. Somebody came in from the Nebraska side, and did some shotgun testin'. They're gettin' ready to suck this baby dry.
2 1868...	What?
3 That's what we're doing here. National interest. National security. Only this time it's not gold. It's uranium.	We're standin' on broken treaty ground, Ray. This ain't supposed to be here. It'll poison the water.
4 Leo knew about it. Tried to tell Jimmy, get the Warriors involved.	So they took care of Leo.
5 Listen to the water... the river keeps goin' down then rising again.

1 I'll have to see what the visions say about that one.	You didn't have another vision...

1 X21, give me a 20.	Black Tail District, X22. You ready for this? Leo wasn't killed in the Badlands. I... I found the location.

1 What ya want?	Must be a bitch getting around in that wheelchair. How long you been in it?
2 Since I got a iron pipe put across my knees, man. Fight with three wasi'cus, ya know.	At Sioux Falls Pen?
3 No, that was Leavenworth. This --  was Sioux Falls. What ya want?	Leavenworth a tough joint?

1 It isn't?	Well, it is. It is that, too.
2 That's a big comfort to me.	I could be, too.
3 How so?	Save you from a big mistake with that other guy.
4 And on to a bigger one with you?

1 Two.	Two miles.
2 Two meters.

1 No!	It's not suffering anymore.
2 You're horrible	You're not, cause you eat frozen meatballs?    Things die. Every time you breathe, you kill millions of tiny organisms. Every time you eat, something had to die.
3 You don't have to kill it.	Somebody does. It's more honest this way. You do your own dirty work.
4 You ever think about killing another human being?	About as much as they think about killing me.

1 Lucky charm.	What do you take me for? It's a Navy Cross.
2 Just good luck.	Where'd you get it.
3 Pawn shop. What's to eat?

1 What does it mean?	That wasn't fair. It was a question. Penalty round!

1 Lieutenant... Is there... a Russian attack?	No sir! But you have to be ready.

1 Hey, if it was easy, everybody would want to come up here and do it..... Instead of just us.	You.

1 THERE'S ANOTHER ONE UP THERE!	I GOT ONE COMING UP.
2 AND HE'S GUNNING.

1 You hear that? Anything we want. Anything...Well???	Well what?
2 What do you want?	What do I want?
3 What do you want?	Any more MiGs?

1 How was it?	Could use a dash more jet fuel.

1 We did it!	Look, Ma, top of the world!

1 What what are you doing? We're cover!	Wood's okay. I want Viper.

1 Well, he's going  and he needs someone to fly the plane.	Skipper, you can't do this!
2 I didn't do it, he did it himself. Something about a wife and kid. The fact is, he's lost it. He knows it. I know it. You were up there, you know it, too. GOOSE Give him a break, Skipper. It was raining snakes up there. He'll be alright, soon as all the gorillas go home...

1 COME OFF RIGHT--COME OFF HIGH--I'M IN--I'LL ENGAGE.	STAY WHERE YOU ARE. HE'S MINE. I'M ENGAGED. I'M IN.

1 The hard deck for this hop was ten thousand feet. Jester, at what point did you call off the fight?	Just below ten thousand.
2 But you continued to fight.

1 You didn't help.	No, really. She came ruined!... Ya think he knows it was me?

1 I wasn't thinking. I just did it.	Big gamble with a thirty million dollar plane!

1 How can I go on? I feel so... responsible.	Kid, the plain fact is...you are. I'm not gonna stand here and blow sunshine up your ass. Technically, they absolved you. You and I know what really happened. You pushed it. You are responsible and you'll always carry that. You know what, I'll carry it too. I should have taken you out of that cockpit. I guess I'm a hopeless romantic... I always try to find something worthwhile in someone's death. It's no trade-off. It's not one for one. What you learned isn't worth his death. It couldn't be. But maybe there is some value in it. I know it's the first thing I've ever seen that's really gotten to you. Now the question is, what will you do with it. If it gets you out of flight status...so you don't kill yourself or anybody else...that's good. That's one good thing. You were an accident waiting to happen.
2 You think I shouldn't fly.	I didn't say that. That's up to you. I think that if you do, if you choose to come back, you'll be a better pilot... a better man.
3 Would you take me back? Would they?	I'll have to think about it. I don't know about them. I do know one thing, We've got a lot invested in you. We'd hate to lose it. Even more than those other guys, Naval Aviation needs a very few, very good men.

1 What happened to number five?	Ah, shit.  You got me.  I ain't even married.  Now put your fucking hands in the air!

1 There you go, Mr. Brubaker.  Suite 610 in the East Wing.	May I use your pen?

1 Richter, do you know why I'm such a happy person?	No, sir.
2 Because I've got the greatest job in the solar system.  As long as the turbinium keeps flowing, I can do anything I want.  Anything.  If fact, the only thing I ever worry about is that one day, if the rebels win, it all might end.

1 Oh shit....Oh shit...	I've been trying to tell you.  Someone erased his memory.

1 Amazing.  Where are we?	At Rekall.

1 Hey, hey Tony.  Give the big guy a break.	Relax, you'll live longer.

1 Harry, what the hell is this?	Come on, let's go have that drink.
2 What the fuck did I do wrong?!  Tell me!	You blabbed, Quaid!  You blabbed about Mars!
3 Are you crazy?!  I don't know anything about Mars.

1 I've got a lock!  There!	Come on!

1 Let me go!	Aw, come on, baby...You're the girl of my dreams.

1 Harry from work...He was the boss.	Take it easy.  Tell me exactly what happened?  Why would "spies" want to kill you?
2 I don't know!  It had something to do with Mars.	Mars?  You've never even been to Mars.
3 I know it sounds crazy, but I went to this Rekall place after work, and...	You went to those brain butchers?!
4 Let me finish!	What did they do to you?  Tell me!
5 --I got a trip to Mars.	Oh God, Doug.
6 Forget Rekall, will you!  These men were going to kill me...	Doug, nobody tried to kill you.
7 They did!  But I killed them!

1 Now help me out here, Doug.  You were interested in a memory of...	Mars.
2 Right.  Mars.	That a problem?
3 To be perfectly honest with you, Doug, if outer space is your thing, I think you'd be much happier  with one of our Saturn cruises.Everybody raves about 'em.	I'm not interested in Saturn.  I said Mars.
4 Okay, you're the boss -- Mars it is.

1 ...What?	There's something I have to tell you...

1 By the way...ever heard of a company names Rekall?	I used to model for 'em, why?
2 Just wondering.

1 The whole core of Mars is ice.  The reactor melts it and releases oxygen.	Enough for everybody to breathe?

1 Yeah, still got one poking around.	That's four.  Let us know if it starts moving, Burt.
2 Roger that.

1 What the hell you doing back already?	You're never going to believe this, but the canyon road...we were on it not two hours ago...well, it's completely...

1 Well, at least the bastard can't climb.  Pardon my French.	Probably couldn't move too easily on the surface.

1 Where the hell are they?  Hope they didn't wise up.	Nope, there!  That's one.

1 Tammy Lynn Baxter.	Don't matter.  They're all the same: dead weight.  Can't make a decision, can't walk because of their shoes, can't work because of their fingernails.  Make my skin crawl!
2 Well, I'm a victim of circumstance.	I thought you called it your pecker.  Look, don't make the mistake I made.  Twenty years of looking for a woman exactly like Miss October 1968, and where'd it get me?  Here with you.

1 Jeez, look at that guy.	One job I'd never take is working around electricity.
2 Especially when it's two hundred feet off the ground.

1 It must've grabbed us.  That's why the truck stalled-out.	Yeah!  Next time I tell you I'm not hung up...!

1 Hey, Rhonda, you ever heard of <u>any</u>thing like this before?	Sure, Earl, everybody knows about them.  We just didn't tell <u>you</u>. Come on, nobody's ever seen one of these!  We're really <u>in</u> on something here!

1 Well, folks, what's the plan?	First let's see if Stumpy's still out there.

1 <u>I'm</u> making the run to the Cat.	Like hell you are.
2 Get real.  I'm faster than you.	<u>I'm</u> best at driving the Cat.
3 Only if something happens to me.

1 Road's in!	Road's in!  Now, soon as we hit Bixby we start making phone calls. We could make some real money off this whole thing, get in <u>People</u> magazine...
2 <u>People</u>?  Hell, <u>National</u> <u>Geographic</u>.	Sell the movie rights.  We're going straight from blue-collar to white -collar.
3 Yeah...but no ties.	No ties.

1 We're here, Val.  Just tell us what you need.  Come back.	They're tearing down the houses here!  We all gotta get outta here together!  Now!

1 I've got a plan.  You and Val take your truck, get to the mountains. Hike to Bixby.  Get us some help.	Those scumsuckers are my radials, Pham!

1 What?!!  Since when the hell's every goddamn thing up to us?!	You guys do all the odd jobs.

1 ...Where're we goin'?	That-a-boy. Hospital.
2 I don' need a hospital... I feel fine.	Too fine, Badalato. The bad news is, you're gonna live.

1 Your Honor, that's not fair -- !	Complain to the Bar Commission.

1 Clyde, you wait here.  Glenn, got a minute?	I had a minute before the Mapp hearing -- but I couldn't get you on the phone, Eddie...
2 Yeah, well I had reasonable cause to believe the judge might've heard of the Fourth Amendment.

1 We have a full caseload, Rog.	Right, I forgot... We're pledged to protect every mid-level drug dealer in the Tri-state area.  It's an awesome responsibility.
2 I don't venerate drug dealers, Roger. To the contrary.	Of course.
3 ...through use of informants, eavesdropping, unreasonable search and seizure...!	Right. You're right.
4 Damn right I'm right.

1 When did you start working for the goddam D.A.?	Eddie... I don't know about this...

1 Goddam it... the little punk bests me again, I get thrown down and lectured at and where the hell were you?	1530 Rivington Street.
2 -- What?	Chuckie's address. I sneaked a peek at the Rolodex.
3 You sneaked a peek at the Rolodex.  Nice.

1 You're the police expert in Chinatown gangs?	...For ten years, now.
2 Do you speak Cantonese, Mandarin, or both?	-- Me? Neither.

1 I've phoned every art supply retailer and wholesaler in the Tri-state area. No one's heard of Chuckie Roeder.	Have you considered that Chuckie Roeder's not calling himself Chuckie Roeder these days? Get his mugshot from one of the many law officers who've got hotpants for you... then canvass those art supplies places. We're gonna win this one, Kitty, but ya gotta believe...

1 An Aryan Warrior with black teardrops painted on his face.	"Painted"?

1 I did two tours in 'Nam...	Good. Now we're going to take an affadavit from you, but only concerning the facts of the Chinatown shooting. We honestly don't give a shit about the Kennedy assassination.

1 But now you've strayed from your area of expertise -- dope -- into street assassins. A subject on which you're dangerously ignorant.	But I'm a quick study. Tell your Deputy D.A. -- Rabin? -- that I'll see him in court.
2 No, Mr. Dowd, you'll see me in court. I'm prosecuting this case.

1 Did you do any hands-on work or did you just supervise, from on high?	Mr. Dowd, I was personally involved with all phases -- and principals -- of the investigation.
2 And who were the detectives who assisted you, Mr. Reynard?

1 What do you want?	I'm Roger Baron. I work with Edward Dowd.

1 You're a l-lawyer?  I... I haven't had my meds, or m-my vital signs t-taken yet. I...	Mr. Stipe. A young man named Jimmy Chin was shot to death eight years ago, in Chinatown. Do you remember talking to the police?
2 That guy they arrested -- he was the wrong g-guy.

1 I'm nearly out.	It's taken care of, babe. You and I are going to make a big score tonight.  This will tide you over.
2 Thank you, Bobby. A big score?	Maybe our biggest. I'll see you two doors down from your place at 11:00.
3 Don't be late.

1 What the hell is that thing doing out there? You're not taking that body anywhere.	We're taking the body back to Portland and there's not a thing you can do about it.
2 Maybe not a thing, but maybe two things.	Teresa Banks had a ring. Any idea what happened to it?
3 We got a phone, here, that's got a little ring.	Sam, get the body and put it in the van.  Sheriff Cable, where were you the night Teresa Banks was murdered?
4 My alibi is as strong as these bands of steel.

1 Okay, that's it. I've had enough of the waiting room now.	Oh.

1 HE'S GONE.	What?
2 ALBERT, COME BACK HERE. HE'S GONE CALL THE FRONT DESK.

1 Came looking for a job with a friend of hers. Pretty girl. Could've been her sister.	What happened to her?
2 There was only one job. Teresa took the job. Her friend took a hike. Never saw her again.	Did you ever see Teresa take cocaine?
3 No.	Do you take cocaine, Irene?
4 No, I do not. I never took cocaine or any other drugs. I don't take drugs.

1 There appears to be a contusion under the ring finger of her left hand.	Oh.

1 My guess is there isn't enough detail in the photo to get an idea of the design on the ring, but we should do a blowup of this anyway.	May I see the magnifying glass, Agent Desmond?  There doesn't seem to be enough detail in the photo to ascertain the design on the ring.

1 Maybe I better start our homework.	Okay, I suppose I should go home.
2 Call me.	Sure. What do you want me to call you?
3 Call me anything just don't call me late for dinner.

1 What are you doing?	Nothing.

1 The diary was hidden too well. He's the only one who could know where it was. He's getting to know me, now. He's real. He speaks to me.	What does Bob say?
2 He wants to be me... or he will kill me.	No... No...
3 Oh, yes... yes...

1 Where were you last night? We were supposed to get together. You didn't show up.	You were supposed to show up. Maybe I wasn't.
2 We were supposed to be together.	How can I be together if I'm not together?
3 You're on somethin' again, aren't you?	James...
4 When am I going to see you?

1 Laura.	What?

1 Let me see.	Dad...
2 Your hands are filthy... look, there is dirt way under this fingernail.

1 Leland...	Laura didn't wash her hands before dinner.  And look at this.

1 Laura just took off. She asked me to do the run today. Should I do it?	What's with that Laura? Yeah, sure, take a look around. There's no one here anyway.
2 You're right. There's no one here.	There's no one here.
3 Norma, are you alright?

1 ...he wants to testify...?	It looks that way.
2 You know what that would mean?	To get somebody from a Boston hospital to say he'll testify?
3 ...a Mrs. Doneghy called... I told you that.

1 Objection!	And you would come here, and on a slip of memory four years ago, you'd ruin their lives.

1 Thank you. When Debby...	Dr. Towler, who was in the operating room with you?
2 Ms. Nevins, nurse-anesthetist; Dr. Marx, of course...

1 I have some errands to run, and then I thought we'd spend the evening...	That's what I'd planned to...
2 I'm going to take you to the home to see the girl...	From what I've seen, Mr. Galvin, you have a very good case...
3 Yes. Yes. I think so. I hope you'll be comfortable. I'm putting you up at my...	...I made a reservation at...
4 ...apartment.  No, no. Please. You don't know who we're dealing with, I, please believe me, they...	...What difference would...
5 These people play very rough. They don't want to lose this case. There's a lot of pressure they can bring to bear, I...	There's nothing they can do to me.

1 Dr. Gruber...	Yes? Galvin, right?

1 I've been meaning to come in a long time.	You live in the neighborhood?
2 Uh-huh. My nephew's going to be staying with us in a few months, so I stopped by.	How old is he?
3 Four. You're great with these kids.

1 Is the Plaintiff ready?	Ready, your Honor.
2 Defense...?

1 Jimmy!  That's why the court exists. The court doesn't exist to give them justice, eh? But to give them a chance at justice.	And are they going to get it?
2 They might. Yes. That's the point... is that they might... you see, the jury wants to believe. They're all cynics, sure, because they want to believe. I have to go in there tomorrow to find twelve people to hear this case. I'm going to see a hundred people and pick twelve. And every one of them it's written on their face, 'This is a sham. There is no justice...' but in their heart they're saying, 'Maybe... maybe...'	Maybe what?
3 Maybe I can do something right.	And is that what you're going to do?  Is that what you're going to do...?
4 That's what I'm going to try to do.

1 Continental Casualty...	Mr. Alito, please.
2 Business hours are over, Sir. This is the switch...	I have to reach him. This is an emergency. Could you give me his home number?
3 I'm sorry, Sir, we're not allowed...	...Would you, would you call him up. I'll give you my number, and ask him...
4 I can't guarantee that...	I understand. Thank you, my name is Galvin. I'll be at the following number in a half an hour. It's urgent.

1 Dr. Gruber.	Dr. Gruber's not in.
2 I had an appointment at his office, I think I must have got it wrong. We had a meeting...	He's not in, Sir.
3 Where is he?

1 Who have we got?	We've got her sister. Testifies she had a meal one hour before she was admitted to the hospital. This is the point.
2 You got the admittance form says patient ate nine hours prior to admittance.	Admittance form is wrong.
3 Forget it. You can't prove it. Sister's testimony is no good. Jury knows we win she gets the cash.	I've got my Dr. Gruber, says her heart condition means they gave her the wrong anesthetic anyway, plus she came in complaining of stomach pains...
4 ...Gruber's not bad.	Not bad...? This guy's Dr. Kildare, the jury's going to love him, Mick... And you calm down, all right? Their guy, Towler's, the author of the book,  'Methodology and Practice, Anesthesiology.'  ...and they got depositions from the nurses, everybody in the operating room, the scrub-nurse... 'All these guys are God. I saw them walk on water...'  They had an obstetrical nurse in there. We got a deposition from the obstetrical nurse?
5 No.	'Mary Rooney, forty-nine. Lives in Arlington, still working at the hospital.' Can you get out tomorrow? How come she isn't speaking up.
6 Right.	Okay now. Cases: Smith versus State of Michigan.
7 Right.	Brindisi versus Electric Boat.
8 You got a good memory, Franky.	I had a good teacher. McLean versus Urban Transport...

1 Are you with me... are you awake...?	Yeah. I'm awake.
2 Rooney's protecting someone. Who is she protecting?	The Doctors.
3 She's protecting the Doctors she'd be up there on the stand...	Read me what she said.

1 I spoke to her, and everything is all right.	I, what are you talking about? I talked to her this morning, and she said...
2 She told me.	She did?
3 I just saw her.	In New York?
4 What?	You saw Kat in New York...  ...or is she in town? Is she in town...?

1 Mister Secretary - if they link up with those others near Fresno...	All right - I've seen enough!

1 Well, you certainly don't look like yourself in that get-up!  But I am happy to meet you anyway. I'm Sylvia Van Buren.  I teach Library Science over at USC.	I didn't know how to stop you...!
2 I might have recognized you without the beard.  And you didn't wear glasses on the 'Time' cover!	They're really for long distance. When I want to look at something close...  I take them off.

1 A big family must be fun...I imagine it makes you feel you belong to something.	It does...Maybe that's why I feel kind of lost right now.
2 We'll get safely out of here, don't worry.	But they seem to murder everything that moves...!
3 If they're mortal, they must have mortal weaknesses.  They'll be stopped -- somehow!

1 I probably wouldn't be able to get to them if I tried...	You'll be all right with us....  ...for as long as anybody's got!
2 Don't let's lose each other.

1 There's one - there's the other, and we're right between them!	So is the town, I notice!
2 I warned you Civil Defense people to be ready if you have to evacuate.	I just came to tell you - everyone has been alerted.

1 Let's go back inside, Uncle Matthew.	I've done about all I can do here. You go back in.  Sylvia - I like that Doctor Forrester.  He's a good man.

1 Sweetie, you've got lots of fans, we've done market studies.  You rate right up there.  We've already got Chase working on a prototype for the glove.	What?
2 I know.  We asked him to keep it kind of surprise until we talked.  Look, how about we get in touch your agent.  You still with Jerry?	Yes, but...
3 We'll work something out.  I'm sure you'll be happy with it.

1 Heather?	Chase. Hi...

1 Doctor...	Get her back!  I've got to go in!  Get me a full anesthetic, STAT!

1 "...as soon as the sun was up the witch made Gretel fetch the wood and kindle a fire.  'We will bake cookies first,' she said.  'I have heated the oven and kneaded the dough.  Crawl in and see if the fire is blazing high enough now.' And she pushed Gretel toward the oven. The witch meant to shut the door and bake her once she was inside."  Dylan, this is too violent.  I don't know why you like these stupid old tales.	Finish, please!
2 This is going to give you nightmares.	I like this story.

1 In my bed.	Your bed?
2 Under my covers.  Kids singing, and way down there, the man...the mean man...

1 What...what is that?	A story?

1 I've never mentioned it to him.	Kids know when something's bugging a parent.  You've got no idea who this is calling?

1 Yeah, Julie, I'm sorry.  I just thought...there was an earthquake, I think.  Little one, but...	Big truck went right by before you opened the door.  Life on the Fault Line.

1 If Freddy's loose, I mean, in your script, where's he going to go?  Another age?  Another form?	That's not what the dreams say he's doing.
2 Then what is he doing?	Well, see, he's gotten used to being Freddy now.  And kinda likes it here in our time and space, too.  So...he's trying to cross over, from film into our reality.

1 Looks like weather.	Yep.

1 Everyone aboard young Bill?	Yes, Sir.
2 Good.  Let's go sailing.

1 There's still a way.	What do you mean?
2 It's me, don't you see.  Terry's right, I'm the escape hatch.  I disobeyed order.

1 I walked in on my parents one time. It was only like eight o'clock and they were in bed and I thought that was kinda weird so I just walked in.	That's what they get for not locking the door.
2 So I'm standing there and you could hear a pin drop.  No breathing or snoring... Suddenly it hits me that somethin' was goin' on that just stopped, really fast, like people are holding their breath.

1 It's a ninety-one!  It's an 'A'!	I know.
2 You know?  Then why are you up here looking like you're about to jump overboard?!	I just can't believe it.
3 This is your moment, don't you see? The instant when you know that your life is never going to be the same again.  When you stand up and are counted.

1 Why'd you do it?	What's the difference?
2 You only hurt yourself you know?	Like you really care.  Like any of you give a shit what happens to me.

1 Jesus.	I can't watch this.

1 Who told you that?	My dad.
2 It works?	Swear to God.  Only good advice he ever gave me.  Now, go back to sleep.

1 Uh, huh.	Would you, um, say it's a big storm?
2 Sometimes it gets exciting out here.

1 Stow away?	He left his passport in Curacao. It's being mailed to Panama.
2 That is unfortunate.  We'll have to take him with us.

1 Well, we thought we'd drop in and see if you were all still in one piece.	And, of course, we are.
2 Well, you never can tell these days, can you?

1 I guess we know what the next acquisition for the galley is going to be...	What's that?
2 A padlock.

1 Don't ever call me stupid.	Come on, he didn't mean anything.

1 Much have I traveled in realms of gold/ And many goodly states and kingdoms seen/ Round many western islands have I been/ Which bards in fealty to Apollo hold/ Oft of one wide expanse had I been told/ That deep-browed Homer ruled as his demesne.	You know what he is talking about here?

1 You gotta be kidding?  He's a human chum line!	No self respecting shark is gonna take a bite out of you.

1 Suicidal...	The first thing is I don't like people talking when I'm talking so the two of you, shut up.

1 Are you hating this?!  Are you!	I hate you, you son of a bitch!!!
2 No.  Hate the fear inside of you! Climb like a man mister!  Hate it! Hate it away.  Hate your way up one more rung!!  Do it right now!!

1 If this young man had responded instantly to your command, do you believe the ship might have been spared?	I don't know that anything could have prevented what happened.
2 Then what are you trying to say then?

1 Hey... You gotta smell in this room of puke... You been pukin' in here, little girl? Huh?... You sick?... Pregnant?	You used the toilet, now you can go - what I do around here ain't any of your business, that's for sure.
2 You know, I really do like a woman with tits like yours that talks tough and acts like she can fuck like a bunny... Can you fuck like that?... You like it like a bunny?... Huh?... Cause baby, I'll fuck you like a real good like a big ol' jack-rabbit bunny... Jump all around in that hole... Bobby Peru doesn't come up for air.	Get out.
3 Am I scarin' ya?... Your pussy wet?... Come on... is it?...  Hey, don't jump back so slow... I thought you was a bunny... Bunny jump fast - you jump back slow... Mean somethin', don't it?... Means somethin' to me... Means you want Bobby Peru... You want Bobby Peru to fuck you hard baby - open you up like a Christmas present.

1 Couple grand or more'd give you two a leg up. Get you to the west coast, Mexico, most anyplace, with a few dollars in your jeans. I got it figured good, Sailor.	When did you talk to Lula?
2 Talked to her this afternoon... While you was out.	She really say she was pregnant?
3 Just took a guess is all... You in or out on this deal?	I ain't fuckin' sure, Bobby.
4 Don't think about it too long.  You had enough?	Have now.
5 Come on outside, I got somethin' to show ya.

1 Mostly black though in that boogie place.	What's the name of it?
2 Club Zanzibar.	You say it's straight ahead a mile?
3 About. Where Lafitte crosses over Galvez Highway. State Road 86.	Thanks.

1 That is my permiso.	Mr. San Pedro Sula's permit to kill.
2 Only if necessary, of course, and only in my own country. 

1 In what capacity?	In many capacities.

1 I'll hire a hit man if you don't want to help me stop this thing. I'll call Marcello Santos.	Now, Marietta, I am goin' to help you. And don't be gettin' carried away. You don't want to be bringin' Santos and his people into it.
2 You're just jealous of Santos cause he's sweet on me.	Darlin', you ain't seein' Santos again, are ya?
3 Oh, Johnnie Farragut... Don't you trust your very own Marietta?	Sorry, sweetheart. Bein' in love with you like I am brings out that ugly jealous side.
4 Well stop worryin' about me and start worryin' about how you're gonna get that Lula back here and away from that murderer.	Sailor ain't a murderer. You got to get off that kick. And far's I can tell, Sailor was entire clean prior to that involvin' Lula. Even there he was protectin' her. You oughta be thankin' him for that. That Bob Ray Lemon they say was comin' after the both of 'em. Why am I tellin' you this, you was around that night. You ought to know just exactly what happened. Sailor just got a little too forceful is all... You remember that night...

1 Damn it, child! Now look what you made me do.	What I made you do, mama?

1 Sailor, you are somethin' else, honey... When I was fifteen, Mama told me that pretty soon I'd be startin' to think about sex, and I should talk to her before I did anything about it.	But honey, I thought you told me your Uncle Pooch raped you when you was thirteen.
2 That's true. Uncle Pooch wasn't really an uncle. He was a business partner of my daddy's? And my mama never knew nothin' about me and him - that's for damn sure. His real name was somethin' kind of European, like Pucinski. But everyone just called him Pooch. He came around the house sometimes when Daddy was away. I always figured he was sweet on mama, so when he cornered me one afternoon, I was surprised more'n a little.	How'd it happen, peanut? He just pull out the old toad and let it croak?

1 I'm sorry, sweetie. I forget some moments where all you been the last two years.	Twenty-three months, eighteen days is all. Don't need to make more'n it was.  This couple's goin' on a date to Hawaii. The girl chose him over the other two guys.
2 Don't the reject guys get anythin'?	Gift certificates to Kentucky Fried Chicken.
3 That don't seem fair.	Hell, why should the Datin' Game be different from real life? At least them boys is gonna get somethin' to eat.

1 ...That's an awful long way to go, just to get some pussy.	Yeah, I had my first taste on that trip to Juarez. At that age you still got a lot of energy.
2 You still got plenty energy for me, baby.

1 M-i-ss-i-ss-i-pp-i... You can almost hear that jazz blowin' up from the big N.O.	Lula... I learned somethin' interestin' today on a science show I heard on the radio... How leeches is comin' back into style.
2 Say what? Honestly, sugar, you can talk more shit sometimes?

1 The water was rollin' off me. And I was dirty, too, like I hadn't had no bath in a long time, so the sweat was black almost.	Boy, sweetie, this is weird, okay.
2 I know. I kept walkin', I headed for your house, only it wasn't your house, really. You let me in only you weren't real pleased to see me. You kept askin', 'Why'd you come to see me now? Why now?' Like it'd been a long time since we'd seen each other.	Oh, baby, what an idea. I'd always be happy to see you, no matter what.
3 I know, peanut. But it wasn't all like you were so unhappy I was there, just you were upset. My bein' there was upsettin' to you. You had some kids there, little kids, and I guess you'd got married and your husband was comin' home any minute.

1 What's wrong, sweetheart? Somethin' botherin' you?	Mama. I been thinkin' about her. She's prob'ly worried to death by now.
2 More'n likely.	I want to call her and tell her I'm okay. That we're okay.
3 I ain't so sure it's a great idea, but that's up to you. Just don't tell her where we are.	Pardon me? Y'all got a phone here I can use?

1 Let's get ahold a' her quick.	You think she's gonna make it?
2 Don't know, but she's gonna bleed all over our car, I'll tell ya that...  Hey... Hello... Girl... You gotta come with us, honey.

1 Anything I can do for you?	No, I don't think so, Sail. I just need to lie down.

1 You hungry? Pace and I ain't had dinner yet.	Lead the way.

1 I'm goin', mama. No way I can't go.	You ain't takin' Pace, though.
2 Course I am, mama.	What time's Sailor's train get in?
3 Six.	Got any plans?
4 Figure we'll go have supper someplace. Maybe get some barbecue out by Stateline. Sailor always liked that Havana Brown's Pig Pickin'.	Well, you be careful with that boy, Lula.
5 Sailor ain't a boy no more, mama.	Don't mean him. It's Pace concerns me.
6 Really, mama, I gotta go.	What if I asked you not to?
7 Wouldn't make any difference.	What if I told you not to?
8 Mama... if you get in the way of me and Sailor's happiness, I'll fuckin' pull your arms out by the roots.

1 ...Sailor Ripley... Can I talk to Lula?	There's no way in hell you can speak to her and...
2 What?...	...Yes you heard me... Don't ever call back here again.

1 You all right, Professor Tripp?	He's great. Come on, let's blow before lo' Gran decides to boil your bones for breakfast.
2 Oh, well, that's just it. She's been coming down here, every half hour or so, to, sort of, check on me. If I'm not here, she might... call the police or... something.	Hhhuh. So we decoy her. Stick a couple pillows and one of your teddy bears under the spread and she won't know the difference.
3 Yeah. Like in Against All Flags. Only they use a couple big hams.

1 He said something about being between things.	Yeah, between a bookie and a pair of broken legs.

1 What's this guy's problem?	Just go around him.

1 Jesus. There must be two dozen windows on that thing. How are we supposed to find his?	I told you. They keep him chained in the basement. Come on.

1 Let me get this straight. Jerry Nathan owes you money. So, as collateral, he gives you his car.	Only now I'm starting to think the car wasn't exactly Jerry's to give.
2 So whose car is it?	My guess -- Vernon Hardapple.
3 The hood jumper?	He said a few things that lead me to believe the car's his.
4 Such as.	'That's my car, motherfucker.'
5 Uh huh. So. We find Vernon, we find the car. We find the car...	...we find the jacket.
6 There's only one problem, Tripp. We don't know his real name. We just made it up. In fact, we made the whole guy up.	No wonder he screwed us over.

1 You driving this car?	Excuse me?
2 This 1966 maroon Ford Galaxie 500. You driving this car?	It's mine.
3 Bullshit. It's mine, motherfucker.	You must be mistaken.
4 Bullshit.

1 Boy or girl?	As long as it looks like her, I don't care. You know what I'm saying?

1 Listen, James, about this afternoon. In workshop. I'm sorry. I think I let things get a bit out of control.	They really hated it. I think they hated it more than any of the other ones.
2 Well...	It doesn't matter. It only took me an hour to write.
3 Really? That's remarkable.	I have trouble sleeping. While I'm lying in bed I figure them out. The stories.

1 Shit, James. You shot Dr. Gaskell's dog.	I had to. Didn't I?
2 Couldn't you've just pulled him off me?	No! He was crazy. I didn't -- he looked -- I thought --
3 Okay, okay. Take it easy. Don't freak out on me.

1 Thank you.	You're welcome.

1 Isn't this...?	Hm.

1 Someone jumped on your car with their butt...	How can you tell?
2 You can see the outline of a butt.

1 That's why they all give you such a hard time in workshop.	Because of my coat?
2 Because you act like a goddamn spook all the time. Not to mention the fact that every last one of them is jealous of you.	Jealous? Of me?
3 Not you. Your talent.

1 I remember that. Five or six years ago.	Six. Their plane went down right outside Scranton.
2 Near Carvel?	I'm sorry about all that. I just -- I don't like to talk about my family. They treat me like a freak.  She makes me sleep in the basement of my own house. It's mine. My parents left it to me.

1 James. This is my editor, Terry Crabtree.	James'll know about George Sanders.

1 The aunt, Hannah. Where did you take James that day?	I told you, Sewickly Heights.
2 But where? I need the street.	I don't know, Grady. I just dropped him on a corner.

1 I'm sure.	Well. This is... surprising. Does Walter...?
2 I think Walter would find this a little more than surprising.

1 Pow.	You got me.
2 I love you, Grady.

1 Someone stole my car.	Grady.
2 Honestly. Someone stole my car. I parked it right there last night.	Are you sure you parked it there?
3 Of course, I'm sure. Ah, Christ, the puberty police are back.

1 The more the merrier.	Terry was telling me about you on the plane. It was all so interesting.

1 Walter?	Yes?

1 Do you get high, Sam?	Only when I'm working.

1 One other thing. About this kid, this student of yours -- Leer -- James Leer. You wouldn't know how I could get in touch with him, would you?	I might have his number on campus.
2 That's all right. We'll find him.

1 Hey, is that a school?	K through sixth.

1 Fucking Mariners.	Fucking Tigers. They got no pitching except for a bunch of green kids straight out of Double A or Southern Cal.  How was the party?
2 What party?	The birthday party.
3 Oh, Anna's. It was great, man. Anna was so pretty.  She looked like a princess, like one of those girls in a fairy tale, you know, like Snow White.

1 There's little chicks!  You want to see?	Sure.

1 Hiya, Walter.	Cop.

1 You walked home.	Yes.

1 Sergeant Lucas.  May I come in?	You are in.

1 What's her name?	Ms. Kramer.
2 Tell Ms. Kramer what your daddy does.	I can't.
3 Yes you can, Robin.

1 You don't like coming here, do you?	It's okay.
2 But you don't like coming here. Be honest, Walter.	Honest? No.
3 Good. That's an honest answer. And why don't you like coming here?	Honest? Your cheery personality makes my skin itch.
4 Is it just my cheery personality that makes your skin itch?	Forget it.
5 Maybe it's the way I look. Or the sound of my name.	Rosen? I don't have a problem with that.
6 Because if you did, I know a therapist named Ryan. I also know a therapist named Chung.	I don't need someone else.

1 When I say the word "girl" what is the earliest image that you can remember?	Nothing. Can I open my eyes?
2 No. When I say the word "pretty," when I say the word "pleasure," what is the earliest memory you see?	I don't see --
3 In your mind, Walter. Take your time.

1 It's going to take time, Walter.	Time.
2 How do you feel about that?	I feel... okay.

1 You plan to drink both those beers?	Sorry.

1 Tell me about it.	Maybe later.
2 How about in the morning.	The morning?
3 I thought I'd stay the night.	What for?
4 Well, Walter, this is going to sound off-the-wall, but I like to sleep with a man after we fuck.

1 Why don't you just go now, okay?	I told you I'm not easily shocked.
2 You should be shocked. Or do you get off on this shit?	What?
3 Get your kicks somewhere else.	Hey, I'm not --
4 Depraved? My mistake.	Walter.

1 Maybe this isn't a good idea.	What?
2 Us seeing each other.

1 Don't do that.	Do what?
2 Sneak up behind me like that.	What's your fucking problem?
3 Why's it always my fucking problem?

1 She-hit.	We're being asked to cooperate in a matter of national security.  Now you know exactly as much as I do.  So just get your gear off and get up to control.  There's some kind of briefing in ten minutes.

1 Deep and slow, big guy.  Deep and slow.  Just breathe easy.	I... they're all dead, Bud.  They're all dead. I thought... some of them... you know...
2 I'm taking you back out.	No!  I'm okay now.  I just don't... I can't go any further in.

1 No, I think you were.  Come on, admit it.	I was worried about the rig.  I've got over four years invested in this project.
2 Oh, yeah, right... and you only had three years with me.

1 Come on, you guys... look, this is the little one right here.  You can see how it's kind of zigging around.	If you say so.  It could be anything.
2 I'm telling you what is there.  You're just not hearing.  The impulses somehow aren't getting from you ears to your brainpan.  There's something down there.  Something not... us.

1 Okay, I'm gonna free-swim to hatch six... get inside, get the door open from the other side.	Bud, that water's only a couple degrees above freezing.
2 Then I guess you better wish me luck, huh?

1 Son of a bitch!	Calm down, Bud.

1 Hello, Brigman.	Hello, Mrs. Brigman.

1 That's Perry.	That's it then.  Finler, McWhirter, Dietz, and Perry.  Jesus.
2 Do we just leave him there?	Yeah, for now.  Our first priority's to get something to breathe.

1 Howdy, y'all.  Hey, Lindsey!  I'll be damned! You shouldn't be down here sweet thing, ya'll might run ya stockings.	Couldn't stay away.  You running mixture for us? Good.  Couldn't ask for better.
2 Okay, here we go.  Start equalizing, y'all.

1 That thing was probably their version of Big Geek... like an ROV.	Just checking is out, huh?  How come?

1 You've got some huevos bringing this... thing... into my rig!  With everything that's been going on up in the world, you bring a nuclear weapon in here?  Does this strike anyone as particularly psychotic, or is it just me?	You don't need to know the details of this mission... you're better off if you don't.
2 You're right... I don't.  I just need to know that this thing is out of here!  You hear me, Roger Ramjet?	Mrs. Brigman, you're becoming a serious impediment to this mission.  I believe the stress is affecting you.  Escort her to quarters and have Monk prepare a tranquilizer.

1 Uh, oh...	What kind of luminous things, Bud?

1 He can still make it.	I know how alone you feel... alone in all that cold blackness... but I'm there in the dark with you, Bud you're not alone...

1 You know, I could just as well go without seeing him today.	What! After giving us such a run around...

1 It's already two hours... What are we going to do?	It takes about twenty to twenty-two hours for the current to reach here from Lisca Bianca.

1 Don't be so humble.	How should I be ... arrogant?
2 But of course... arrogant, haughty... Hasn't Anna ever told you?

1 I think that you might go and have a look yourself.	Yes, maybe that is better.

1 Good. It's better if it were absurd. That would mean nothing much can be done about it.	But just think -- the very same things you had said to her who knows how many times... maybe even just before we left, while I was waiting outside your place...
2 So, even if I did say them, I was sincere with her, as I am now with you.

1 Sandro, wait a moment, just one moment... You seem like an entirely different person ...	And aren't you pleased?... That way you'll have a new kind of adventure.

1 What amazes me, is Sandro. He seems so calm.	Calm?... He doesn't seem so to me... He was awake all night.

1 Now, listen. For God's sake, try not to let yourself become obsessed with that idea. Go to your room and get back into bed.	Just several days ago, the thought of Anna being dead would have made me sick. And now, I don't even cry, I'm afraid she might be alive. Everything is becoming so damned simple and easy, even to deprive one's self of pain and suffering.
2 You should never wish to get melodramatic over anything.	Yes, you're right. I'm sick and tired of being like that.

1 Looks like the weather is changing.	Please, Giulia; must you always emphasize the obvious? I can see for myself that the weather is changing.

1 Up until now those smugglers were operating only around the Palermo area. This will be a nice surprise for the Lieutenant in Milazzo... Call up headquarters. Bring them up to date and have them give you instructions on what to do with this crate.	So... the boat we saw yesterday afternoon might have also been that of these smugglers. Could it be possible, then, that Anna...?
2 I wonder where they could have unloaded the stuff ... Maybe right here at Lisca.	I was saying... it might even be possible that Anna had left with them.
3 But for what reason would she have wanted to go away?	Listen, Marshal... As for there being reasons for going away, anyone of us might have three thousand of them. So you can assume that she had them. What I want to know, is it possible that the smugglers might have taken her aboard?
4 I think it's possible.

1 It's strange how anxious women are to display themselves. It's almost a natural inclination.	But how could they pose like that? I couldn't.
2 Why don't you try?	Me... Goffredo, you're mad!  He's mad.

1 Then you should also be able to tell me where a young girl might stay in Noto; are there any hotels or rooming houses?	There's the Trinacria Hotel... or the Regina, near the municipal building. As for rooming houses, I don't know...
2 Thank you.	Don't mention it... Pleased to be of service any time.

1 Why have we stopped?	Lady Patrizia!

1 Agnes, it has come to my attention that you have stopped eating. Why is this? AGNES  I've been commanded by God.	He talked to you Himself?
2 No.	Through someone else?
3 Yes.	Who?
4 I can't say.	Why?
5 She'd punish me.	One of the other Sisters?
6 No.	Who?

1 First thing that comes to your mind?	God!  But there's nothing to say about God.
2 Second thing that comes to your mind.	Love.
3 Have you ever loved anyone?	Yes.
4 Who?	Everyone.
5 Well, who in particular?	Right now?
6 Uh huh.	I love you.
7 Agnes, have you ever loved another man... other than, Jesus Christ?	Yes.
8 Who?	Oh, there are so many.
9 Well do you love... do you love Father Martineau?	Oh, yes!
10 Do you think he loves you?	Oh, I know he does.
11 He's told you?	No. But... when I look into his eyes, I can tell.
12 You've been alone together?	Yes.
13 Often?	At least once a week.
14 And you like that?	Oh, yes.
15 Where do you meet?	In the confessional.

1 How would that person get one if they didn't want one?	A mistake...
2 Agnes, how did your mother get you?	A mistake... it was a mistake...
3 Is that what she said?	If you're trying to get me to say that she was a bad woman and hated me and didn't want me but that's not true, she was a good woman, a saint... 
4 Agnes, I don't believe you know nothing about sex...	I can't help it if I'm stupid.
5 ... that you don't remember getting pregnant...	Not my fault.
6 ... and that you don't believe you carried a child.	I was a mistake.
7 What the child?	Everything... I don't have children.
8 Agnes...

1 My bed.	What else?
2 A crucifix.	Above the bed?  Any... anything else? What do you you see, something different?  What is it?
3 A wastepaper basket.	Do you know who put it there?
4 No.	What do you think it's there for?
5 For me to get sick in.	Are you ill?
6 Yes.	What do you feel?
7 I feel as if I've eaten glass.	What do you do?
8 I have to throw up...

1 God!  It was God.  And now I'll burn in hell because I hate him.	Agnes you won't burn in hell. It's alright to hate him.

1 Thanks. 	If I find anything I'll call you.

1 And you had a sister who died in the convent.	Who told you this?
2 Do you still go to church?	What business is it of yours..?
3 Oh, we just wonder if you can be very objective about this case.	Look, Father, ah... just because I don't subscribe to the... to the beliefs you subscribe to...
4 But what you believe makes no difference to us whatsoever Doctor. But it does make all the difference to Agnes.	I don't understand. Are you expecting me to..?
5 Well somone's got to suffer for this Doctor. You've got to be merciful and quick. Excuse me.

1 You hate us don't you?	What?
2 Nuns... you hate nuns.	I hate ignorance and stupidity.
3 The Catholic Church...	I haven't said anything against the the Catholic Church.
4 Catholicism is not on trial here. I want you to deal with Agnes without any religious prejudice or you turn this case over to someone else...	How dare you tell me to run my affairs!

1 Like keeping her home from school?	Yes.
2 Listening to angels?	She drank too much. That's what killed her.
3 Do you know what she did to her?	I don't think I care to know.
4 She molested her!	Oh, dear God.
5 There is more here than meets the eye isn't there?  Lots of dirty little secrets.	Oh God, if only I'd known.
6 Why didn't you?  You knew she was keeping her home from school. You knew she was an alcoholic.	I knew that after the fact.
7 Why didn't you do anything to stop her?	Because I didn't know... 
8 Oh, God.

1 May I be present?	Of course.
2 Then let's begin.

1 Lay them down.	Eh?
2 Lay them down.	We'd be thrown out.
3 Your cards... lay them down... face up.

1 All right, all right. If you don't need this lot, I'll lock 'em up in the dressing room till you do.	Please do, I'll not need them for fifteen minutes. Thank you.

1 He doesn't like me, honest, I can tell ... It's 'cos I'm little.	You've got an inferiority complex, you have.
2 Yeah, I know, that's why I took up the drums. It's me active compensatory factor.

1 Gerron.	No, straight up.

1 Well ... come on.	Sorry.

1 No, I didn't you did ...	Well, what happened?
2 The old fella wanted these pictures and Norm said he couldn't have 'em, all I said was 'aw go on, be big about it.'

1 Ah.	Quite right, invites to gambling dens full of easy money and fast women, chicken sandwiches and cornets of caviar, disgusting!

1 And we're looking after him, are we?	I'll look after meself.

1 Anything to spare?	We've just finished, Pauly. Hey George, write us your John Henry on this picture.

1 Eh, he's a nice old man, isn't he?	Oh yeah, he's very clean, y'know.

1 Behave...	Foreign devil ...

1 Oh, it's got round that you're a heavy punter.	Well you're not going.

1 Hi Norm!	Hi, our lot!

1 Well, look after him. I don't want to find you've lost him.	Don't be cheeky, I'll bind him to me with promises. Come on, Grandad.

1 Oh dear, I feel like doing a bit of work.	Good lad, Ringo.

1 ... as they head up for the show. Oh yes, well I mean it'ud be a pity to miss the show, wouldn't it like.	Shurrup, cheerful.

1 What is he?	I've got a little list here. Wandering abroad. Malicious intent. Acting in a suspicious manner. Conduct liable to cause a breach of the peace. You name it, he's done it.
2 Oh, a little savage, is he?	A proper Aborigine.

1 Dell, what's the last thing you can remember?	... I don't know...
2 Do you remember the pyramid?	No.  Just some horrible dreams about smothering.  Where are we?

1 Close enough to walk to!	Martin, would you run me an atmospheric?

1 Dell, you want to come down, we can figure out where to go from here.	No, I want to go in.

1 Computer, what language was that?	Unknown.

1 Sorry to interrupt, but I'm gonna charge up the engines for a minute, okay?	Yeah, okay.  Go ahead.

1 What the hell's going on?	Don't know -- Broussard got hurt somehow.
2 Hurt!  How?	Don't know -- maybe we'll be real lucky and he just broke his neck.  I knew we shouldn't of come down here.

1 Hey, guess what?	What?
2 The engines are fixed.

1 All right... but do <u>not</u> go below decks.	Right. 
2 And be right back.

1 It's over, Hunter.	Boy, that's terrific.
2 Well, how does it feel to be rich men?

1 Don't worry, it won't damage it, it'll just give it a little incentive.	How do we locate the creature?

1 The ship's gravitational attraction must have drawn him back.	Should we go outside and bring him in?
2 No... the risk is too great.  Perhaps after we've destroyed the thing.

1 I keep my mouth pretty much shut, but I don't like hitting.	I guess I had it coming.  Let's call it settled.

1 ... And Broussard got caught in their reproductive cycle.	You will notice, though, that there are no more phases.  Only four forms are shown.  After that the pattern repeats.

1 I've got it.  It's coming from ascension 6 minutes 32 seconds, declination -39 degrees 2 seconds.	Dell -- show me that on a screen.

1 What'd he say?	I couldn't make it out -- too much interference.

1 That sounds a little fanciful...	Primitive pictorial languages are based on common objects in the environment, and this can be used as a starting point for translation...

1 Men have waited centuries to contact another form of intelligent life in the universe.  This is an opportunity which may never come again.	Look --

1 This is Chaz speaking.  Sorry, but we are not home.  Our present location seems to be only halfway to Irth. Remain at your posts and stand by. That is all.	Chaz, I've got something here on my security alert.  A high priority from the computer...
2 Let's hear it.	Computer, you have signalled a priority three message.  What is the message?

1 Find anything we missed?	I don't even know what I'm looking for.
2 Still worried?	Oh well... you know me.
3 I've always respected your opinion, Martin.  If something worries you, it worries me.

1 I'm sorry to say it looks like you were right in the first place, Martin.  We never should have landed here.	Look, I'm not trying to rub anybody's nose in anything.  The important thing is just to get away from here as fast as possible.
2 I can't lean on Faust any harder -- he's been working non-stop on the engines.	If we knew exactly what happened to the beings on the other ship --

1 What's it doing, having a seizure?	It started crashing around right after we locked it in.
2 Now what?	I guess we open the door and net it.

1 That next thing there -- six legs, tentacles -- that's the thing we saw in the food locker.	So the next step should be --

1 <u>Hey watch it</u>!	It's stable; it doesn't hurt to drop it.

1 Me either.  I tell you, I used to be with a mining outfit on Callisto, and when something like that hits... believe me, you know about it.	Do you wanna head back and call it in?

1 A pair of incomings.  They popped-up on the medium-range about thirteen twenty-four local time.	We figured on it being a magnetic anomaly, but we ran a back-trace just to make sure.
2 Yeah.  Turns out they dropped straight out of hyperspace.

1 MarsCo went belly-up on the Dow Jones.	Shit.  When?
2 Yesterday.  We got the Network feed from Gateway; it was the top story on 'Sixty Seconds'.  Biggest market crash since twenty-four.

1 Oh, man...	Alright, let's keep calm.  We've got to have an option of some sort... there's got to be a way out of this.

1 Whoa, wait a minute...	What?
2 Just got a reading...

1 Wait.  Lost it.	How?
2 I dunno.  Might be a glitch.

1 Yeah, I stripped down a motion tracker and hardwired it through to the helmet pick-ups, too.  That's also on the display.	Sounds great.

1 Everything on this module is locked and sealed.  We've lost 'B', 'C', and 'E' wings, but 'E' was the only one we didn't manage to totally evacuate.	How many... how many people are missing?

1 Hey, boss.  Wondered where you'd gotten to.	I just... wanted to be put on my own for a while.  Clear my head.
2 Didn't feel like whoopin' it up with the rest of us blue collars, huh?

1 Think I spoke too soon...	Again?  How long before we start noticing the difference?

1 How's it going?	Yeah, 'Good Evening' to you, too.

1 I don't think that's funny.	It wasn't meant to be.
2 I confide in you and rely on you more than anyone I've ever known! To say a thing like that now - without any reason - when I need you more than ever...	I hope you mean what you say, Eve. I intend to hold you to it.

1 I see. And when was this unholy alliance joined?	We decided the night before last, before we came up here...
2 Was the setting properly romantic - the lights on dimmers, gypsy violins off stage?	The setting wasn't romantic, but Lloyd was. He woke me up at three in the morning, banging on my door - he couldn't sleep, he told me - he's left Karen, he couldn't go on with the play or anything else until I promised to marry him... we sat and talked until it was light. He never went home...
3 You sat and talked until it was light...	We sat and talked, Addison. I want a run of the play contract.
4 There never was, there'll never be another like you.	Well, say something - anything! Congratulations, skol - good work, Eve!

1 I won't play tonight.  I couldn't. Not possibly. I couldn't go on...	Couldn't go on? You'll give the performance of your life.

1 Tell me this. Do they have auditions for television?	That's all television is, my dear. Nothing but auditions.

1 You mustn't worry about your little charge. She is in safe hands.	Amen.

1 Macbeth.	We know you, we've seen you before like this. Is it over - or just beginning?

1 Take care of yourself out there...	I understand they've got the Indians pretty well in hand...
2 Bill...	Huh?
3 Don't get stuck on some glamour puss-	I'll try.
4 You're not such a bargain, you know, conceited and thoughtless and messy-	Everybody can't be Gregory Peck.
5 - you're a setup for some gorgeous wide-eyed young babe.	How childish are you going to get before you quit it?
6 I don't want to be childish, I'd settle for just a few years-	And cut that out right now.
7 Am I going to lose you, Bill? Am I?	As of this moment you're six years old...

1 Looks like I'm going to have a very fancy party...	I thought you were going to be late-
2 When I'm guest of honor?	I had no idea you were even here.
3 I ran into Eve on my way upstairs; she told me you were dressing.	That never stopped you before.
4 Well, we started talking, she wanted to know all about Hollywood, she seemed so interested...	She's a girl of so many interests.
5 It's a pretty rare quality these days.	She's a girl of so many rare qualities.
6 So she seems.	So you've pointed out, so often. So many qualities, so often. Her loyalty, efficiency, devotion, warmth, affection - and so young. So young and so fair...

1 It's obvious you're not a woman.	I've been aware of that for some time.
2 Well, I am.	I'll say.
3 Don't be condescending.	Come on, get up. I'll buy you a drink.
4 I admit I may have seen better days, but I am still not to be had for the price of a cocktail - like a salted peanut.	Margo, let's make peace.
5 The terms are too high. Unconditional surrender.	Just being happy? Just stopping all this nonsense about Eve - and Eve and me?
6 It's not nonsense.	But if I tell you it is - as I just did. Were you listening to me?  Isn't that enough?
7 I wish it were.	Then what would be enough?  If we were married?
8 I wouldn't want you to marry me just to prove something.	You've had so many reasons for not wanting to marry me... Margo, tell me what's behind all this.
9 I - I don't know, Bill. Just a feeling, I don't know...	I think you do know but you won't or can't tell me.  I said before it was going to be my last try, and I meant it. I can't think of anything else to do. I wish I could.  We usually wind up screaming and throwing things as the curtain comes down. Then it comes up again and everything's fine. But not this time.  You know there isn't a playwright in the world who could make me believe this would happen between two adult people. Goodbye, Margo.

1 Often enough to keep the franchise.	A foursquare, upright, downright, forthright married lady... that's for me. And no more make believe! Off stage or on... remember, Lloyd.  I mean it, now. Grown-up women only, I might even play a mother - only one child, of course, not over eight...  Lloyd, will you promise not to be angry with me?

1 Don't run away, Bill.	From what would I be running?
2 You're always after truth - on the stage. What about off?	I'm for it.
3 Then face it. I have. Since that first night - here - in the dressing room.	When I told you what every young actress should know.
4 When you told me that whatever I became, it would be because of you-	Your make-up's a little heavy.
5 - and for you.	You're quite a girl.
6 You think?	I'm in love with Margo. Hadn't you heard?
7 You hear all kinds of things.	I'm only human, rumors to the contrary. And I'm as curious as the next man...
8 Find out.	Only thing, what I go after, I want to go after. I don't want it to come after me.

1 There are some human experiences, Birdie, that do not take place in a vaudeville house - and that even a fifth-rate vaudevillian should understand and respect!  I want to apologize for Birdie's-	You don't have to apologize for me!  I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings. It's just my way of talkin'...

1 Please don't have me arrested, please! I didn't steal anything - you can search me!	How did you get in here?
2 I hid outside in the hall till the maid came to turn down your bed. She must've forgot something and when she went to get it, she left the door open. I sneaked in and hid till she finished. Then I just looked around - and pretty soon I was afraid somebody'd notice the lights were on so I turned them off - and then I guess, I fell asleep.	You were just looking around...
3 That's all.	What for?
4 You probably won't believe me.	Probably not.
5 It was for my report.	What report? To whom?
6 About how you live, what kind of clothes you wear - what kind of perfume and books - things like that. You know the Eve Harrington clubs - that they've got in most of the girls' high schools?	I've heard of them.
7 Ours was one of the first. Erasmus Hall. I'm the president.	Erasmus Hall. That's in Brooklyn, isn't it?
8 Lots of actresses come from Brooklyn. Barbara Stanwyck, Susan Hayward - of course, they're just movie stars.

1 Hello, Miss Channing.	My husband...

1 You mustn't mind Margo too much, even if I do...	But there must be some reason, something I've done without knowing...
2 The reason is Margo and don't try to figure it out. Einstein couldn't.	If I thought I'd offended her, of all people-
3 Eve. I'm fond of Margo too. But I know Margo. And every now and then there is nothing I want to do so much as to kick her right square in the pants.	Well - if she's got to pick on someone, I'd just as soon it was me.

1 I think I know...	Something most important you can do.
2 You want to play "Cora." You want me to tell Lloyd I think you should play it.	If you told him so, he'd give me the part. He said he would.
3 After all you've said... don't you know the part was written for Margo?	It could have been - fifteen years ago. It's my part now.
4 You talk just as Addison said you did.	"Cora" is my part. You've got to tell Lloyd it's for me.
5 I don't think anything in the world could make me say that.

1 It's been a real pleasure, Eve.	I hope so, Mr. Richards. Good night...

1 While you're cleaning up, I'll take this to the wardrobe mistress-	Don't bother. Mrs. Brown'll be along for it in a minute.
2 No trouble at all.

1 It's the tight girdle that does it.	I find these wisecracks increasingly less funny! 'Aged in Wood' happens to be a fine and distinguished play-

1 Do you want it on?	It doesn't matter.
2 I detest cheap sentiment.

1 I remember.	You'll be there, won't you.

1 But it can't be! We can't be out of gas! I filled it myself yesterday!  Wasn't it full when you drove to Brewster this morning?	I guess I didn't look. You know I don't pay attention to those things...
2 Incredible.

1 Three days, that's for the bourgeois - I see a midnight elopement, waking up a village person...	What are you going to wear?

1 How about calling it a night?	And you pose as a playwright. A situation pregnant with possibilities - and all you can think of is everybody to go to sleep...

1 I shall never understand the weird process by which a body with a voice suddenly fancies itself a mind! Just when exactly does an actress decide they're her words she's saying and her thoughts she's expressing?	Usually at the point when she's got to rewrite and rethink them to keep the audience from leaving the theater!
2 It's about time the piano realized it has not written the concerto!

1 "Liebestraum."	I just played it.
2 Play it again.	But that was the fourth straight time.
3 Then this will be five. I suppose you think I'm too drunk to count.	No. You're just crazy about "Liebestraum."
4 "Liebestraum."	Look, Miss Channing... it's kind of depressing. If you don't mind my saying so, everybody's kind of dying on the vine...
5 My dear Horowitz. In the first place, I'm paying you union scale. Second, it's my piano. Third, if everybody doesn't like kind of dying on the vine, they can get off the vine and go home. "Liebestraum."

1 What is it about my writing that's so rotten?	Mainly it has to do with your choice of words.

1 Goddamnit--	--see?--
2 --I'm trying--	--fifteen phone calls--
3 ---fifteen or more phone calls from the burglars in Miami to Gordon Liddy at CREEP--	Why didn't we get that?
4 Christ, and I even know somebody at the phone company--	--you do?--with access to records?

1 I  couldn't believe what she told me. Eight cups of coffee worth.	Go on, go on--
2 --we've got to find out who the five guys are--the five with access to the slush fund--they were aware of the break-in.	Then tomorrow's grand jury indictments will just be bullshit.
3 It goes very high--we've got to find out where--	--we will--
4 --she was really paranoid, the bookkeeper.	That happens to people.  OK, go on.

1 What would you have done?	You asking would I have been one of the President's men?  I would have been.

1 You overslept?	Goddamnit!--

1 Mr. Dardis does call in every so often?	Well of course.
2 Good. Just tell him I was here, that I'm sorry I missed him--

1 --you got more than one source?--	--yes--

1 Hannah, I never would have bothered you but I'm off to Miami and they're gonna take away my ten speed unless I get it straightened out fast.	Where are your bills, Carl?
2 Oh, they're here.  I'm keeping much better records now, Hannah.  See? 	Carl, it's a jungle.  I suggest you either pay this immediately or lay in a large supply of candles.  You'd give a stranger the shirt off your back--except it wouldn't be paid for.

1 It's awfully hot--  --and you haven't finished telling me about the money--	--omigod, there was so much of it, six million came in one two-day period-- six million cash, we couldn't find enough places to put it. I thought it was all legal, I guess I did, til after the break-in, when I remembered Gordon got so much of it.
2 Gordon Liddy, you mean?	It was all so crazy--the day after the break-in he gave us a speech, bouncing up and down on his heels in that loony way of his--Gordon told us not to let Jim McCord ruin everything--don't let one bad apple spoil the barrel, he said. You just know that when Gordon Liddy's calling someone a bad apple, something's wrong somewhere.  ...It's all so rotten... and getting worse... and all I care about is Hugh Sloan. His wife was going to leave him if he didn't stand up and do what was right. And he quit. He quit because he saw it and didn't want any part of it.
3 Think Sloan's being set up as a fall guy for John Mitchell? Sometimes it looks that way.

1 --that leaves Haldeman, period.	I'm not your source on that.

1 I was told by this guy at the White House that Hunt was investigating Teddy Kennedy.	How senior?
2 You asking me to disclose my source?

1 Mr. Rafferty was very helpful. Four Cuban-Americans and this other man, James McCord.	Look, I told you inside--
2 --you have nothing more to say, I understand that.

1 I hope you noticed how coolly I behaved under the threat of discovery.	Do Justice and the FBI know what we know, and why the hell haven't they done anything about it?
2 They know, but they focused on the burglary--if it didn't deal with the break-in, they didn't pursue it.	Why didn't they?--who told them not to?
3 Someone with authority I'd imagine, wouldn't you?  Don't you know what you're onto? Come on.	Mitchell knew then.
4 Of course--my God, you think something this big just happens? The break-in and the cover up, of course Mitchell knew, but no more than Ehrlichman.	Haldeman too?
5 You get nothing from me about Haldeman?

1 --correction--when you were drinking your lunch at the bar of the Sans Souci--	--this White House guy, a good one, a pro, came up and asked what is this Watergate compulsion with you guys and I said, well, we think it's important and he said, if it's so goddamn important, who the hell are Woodward and Bernstein?
2 Ask him what he's really saying--he means take the story away from Woodstein and give it to his people at the National Desk--	--well, I've got some pretty experienced fellas sitting around, wouldn't you say so?--
3 --absolutely--and that's all they do, sit sit sit--every once in a while, they call up a Senator, some reporting--	--well, what if your boys get it wrong--

1 Anything?	Woodward's onto a new wrinkle with the break-in thing--absolute page one stuff--
2 --in other words, you got nothing, you're thumbsucking.	Could develop.
3 Let me see what you get, but don't jump--The New York Times thinks it's crazy Cubans.

1 --which Young?	Larry Young, a California lawyer--

1 --look, when the Watergate grand jury questioned you, did you name names?	Of course--everything they asked--

1 Alright, well...you've got to tone it down.  You don't need to go to Lookout Point and spout cheeseball lines to be romantic.	...okay...
2 You have to pay attention to a girl. Be sensitive to her feelings. Relationships are reciprocal.	I'm not good in math.

1 This is your plan, Finch?	Yep.

1 Yeah...so like, what else <u>do</u> you do?	Well the same things you do.  Hang out with friends and stuff, you know, whatever.  What do you think I do?
2 I just -- realized that I didn't know anything about you.  I was interested.	Oh...well that's okay.  Cool.

1 So we're gonna be close next year?	You -- oh, you mean -- yeah, East Lansing and Ann Arbor.
2 ...yeah.

1 Jessica, can you drive me home?	Sure.

1 There's our man.	Finch, you got the Latin homework?

1 I have no idea.  Finch showers in a bathing suit.	No -- it's true.  He is...really... big.
2 Yeah, enormous.

1 Yeah?  Well come prom night, those excuses aren't going to do you much good.	Jesus, Kevin, rub it in.

1 Dad!  I know!	Do you know about the clitoris?
2 Yes dad.	Sometimes it can be pretty hard to locate.
3 Thank you, dad, I got it.	Okay, well that about covers it.

1 So, the end of the story is...you had to kiss the guy for twenty seconds?	Yes!  And he was such a dork!  And everyone laughed at me, but I didn't care?  Because it was so funny!
2 Okay, I get it.	Oh!  And then this one time?  At band camp?  I stuck a flute in my pussy.

1 Feels like warm apple pie, dude.	Apple pie...  McDonald's or homemade?

1 You did it.	Fellas, say goodbye to Chuck Sherman, the boy.  I am now a man.

1 No, no, you must put your whole body into it.	Nadia, I can't --
2 Can't what?  Do you not want to be with me?  I wish to be entertained, James.

1 "Dear Ms. Hughes.  We're sorry, but after keeping you on the wait list for the past couple months, we've decided you are now rejected.  Enclosed is a 100-page, full-color brochure on how rejected you are."	Kevin, this is serious!
2 You got in.

1 Like how?	Well, I feel that...things are getting to that point in a relationship. When two people share...a special moment between them.
2 I think you're so right, Kevin.	You want to do it?
3 Yes --

1 So, do you want to be -- I mean, how do you want to do it?	I don't know.  How do you?
2 Like, normal style.  The...missionary position.	Okay.

1 Hey.  I got another question for you.	What's that?

1 So, I'm thinking prom is basically our last big chance.	Dude, prom sucks.
2 I know, but think about it -- At the parties that night.  Chicks are gonna want to do it.

1 Yeah, but we'll still see each other.	Fuck yeah we will.

1 God, I can't believe there are so many cool people at this party.	Yep.

1 Tell you what, we'll jump together.	Sure. We wouldn't ask you to do anything we wouldn't do. Now give me your hand... that's it...

1 Face it boyfriend. This is really happening.	No it isn't! You're dead!

1 Professor Claude Rousel. The one your uncle was working with. He teaches cultural history.	In an underground club? I'd like to see that.

1 Come on Serafine. Let's go out. Show me the real Paris, the part that isn't overpriced and overrun with German tourists.	Go to Jim Morrison's grave at Pere Lachaise. It's overrun with American tourists. I have to work.
2 I know! Let's go hock loogies off the Eiffel Tower!

1 I'm not alright. We both know that. The only reason I'm here now is to warn you. You're still in danger. Gaston told me that Claude has got the curse too. He's a werewolf.	I know. He told me.
2 What?! He told you? When?

1 Holy mother of God...	Fuck me...

1 What does it say?	"Stop! Beyond this passage lie the catacombs of Paris: the exclusive domain of the dead."

1 It's you. You should be dead in that wreck with Bazin and Racine!	Shhh! Be quiet, man! We're not alone -
2 Shut up! Save your stories. The only thing I want to hear is you begging for your life. I want to see you suffer, like they did.  Haha! You're scared now, eh? Come on. Where's the scary monster now huh? Ha ha... We'll see who -

1 Another step and he's dead!	Go ahead Serafine. Blow him away.

1 It's horrible. Terrence was one of the most brilliant men I've known.	Yeah, well, why did he hang out here? The cops said it's dangerous -
2 The cops. It's their backward laws that force all this underground in the first place, endangering people whose only crime is pushing the limits of perception, exploring new states of psychic awareness.

1 It killed him... You coulda just used Draino. It's cheaper.	I told him it wasn't ready...

1 Jesus...	How well did, er, do you know him?
2 Not too well. He taught at the Sorbonne, right? Dad always calls him his "hippie brother". Did some work with Timothy Leary I think, and - Is he... is he going to die?	No. The doctors say the machines should keep him going a long time. But basically he is, how you say, a legume.
3 Legume? You mean, a vegetable?	Vegetable, right. My mistake. It seems he was attacked by a maniac, maybe two or three maniacs, just after midnight. yesterday. They fled into the tunnels beneath Paris, that's all we know...
4 What do you mean, maniacs?	Well, here's what I think happened. A chemistry professor goes to a bad part of town late at night. Why? Perhaps he's making a few francs on the side. The psychedelic drug market is big these days. He gets mixed up with a bad crowd and, like they say, if you lie with dogs, you get fleas.
5 Yeah, well, these fleas must have teeth like fuckin' chain saws.

1 Enough. Cut him loose.	I can't! At midnight tonight, he will kill again. It's crazy!
2 Are you crazy? We have nothing. Let him go, then watch him. If you're right, you can pick him up at midnight. Or maybe he'll lead you to the others. Just let him go.

1 You better follow that McDermott kid. He's going to wind up like his uncle if he's not careful.	Right. Little twerp thinks he's Colombo.

1 Who did you hear it from?	I heard it from everyone who said I didn't hear it from them!   Do you know Dmitri?

1 Fortunately, I am to be married.  With your highness, permission.	Vlad, stop acting this way! You're my friend!
2 No. From now on I am your loyal subject ... your highness. By your leave?

1 Just what do you think you're doing?!	Trying... to... breathe...

1 Oh! I'm sorry...	It's okay. Didn't hurt..

1 ... and that Christmas dinner, when Cook made that awful plum pudding and we hid it in our pockets so we wouldn't hurt her feelings! I do remember so much now, Grandmama, - but not everything.	Don't worry about that now, child, it will all come back to you now that you're home...

1 Trust me, it's her!	How do you know?
2 Rodent's intuition, how do I know? She looks exactly like her. Except she's taller, which is natural ... Of course my second cousin Treplev - he never grew. Looks like a little pepper shaker. He was so cute ...

1 It's her.	He's her?
2 Look!

1 We did it! We did it, my boy! We're going to see Tatiana at the ballet tonight and we're going to be rich! Rich!	But it's not the money, Vlad.
2 Are you feeling all right?

1 I sent for you because I owe you a debt of gratitude larger than I can ever repay	No. Empress, you --
2 I want you to have the reward money - you've earned it.

1 Hey!	What?
2 This is Alvy Singer!

1 Allison.	Yeah? Allison what?
2 Portchnik.

1 I missed my therapy. I overslept.	How can you possibly oversleep?
2 The alarm clock.	You know what a hostile gesture that is to me?
3 I know- because of our sexual problem, right?	Hey, you... everybody in line at the New Yorker has to know our rate of intercourse?

1 Great! Great!  Goddammit!  Ooooh! These are... p-p-p-pick this lobster up. Hold it, please!	All right! All right! All right! All right! Whatta yuh mean? Are yuh gonna take pictures now?
2 It'll make great- Alvy, be- Alvy, it'll be wonderful... Ooooh, lovely!	All right, here! Oh, God, it's disgusting!

1 For yuh.	Okay, that's good.

1 God bless.	Well, uh...  You're what Grammy Hall would call a real Jew.
2 Oh, thank you.	Yeah, well... you- She hates Jews. She thinks that they just make money, but let me tell yuh, I mean, she's the one yeah, is she ever. I'm tellin' yuh.
3 So, did you do shoot the photographs in there or what?	Yeah, yeah, I sorta dabble around, you know.

1 Look at these guys.	Yeah.
2 Oh, that's hilarious. They're back from Fire Island. They're... they're sort of giving it a chance-you know what I mean?	Oh! Italian, right?
3 Yeah, he's the Mafia. Linen Supply Business or Cement and Contract, you know what I mean?	Oh, yeah.
4 No, I'm serious.  I just got my mustache wet.	Oh, yeah?
5 And there's the winner of the Truman Capote look-alike contest.

1 Really?	U-huh.
2 I don't know, but you seem sort of distant.	Let's just do it, all right?
3 Is it my imagination or are you just going through the motions?

1 Adult education is such junk! The professors are so phony. How can you do it?	A bit rapidly. I don't care what you say about David, he's a perfectly fine teacher!
2 David! David! I can't believe this!	And what are you doing following me around for, anyway?
3 I'm following you and David, if you-	I just think we oughta call this relationship quits!

1 Alvy, let's never break up again. I don't wanna be apart.	Oh, no, no, I think we're both much too mature for something like that.
2 Living together hasn't been so bad, has it?	It's all right for me, it's been terrific, you know?  Better than either one of my marriages. See, 'cause... 'cause there's just something different about you. I don't know what it is, but it's great.
3 You know I think that if you let me, maybe I could help you have more fun, you know? I mean, I know it's hard and... Yeah.	I don't know.
4 Alvy, what about... what if we go away this weekend, and we could-	Tsch, why don't we get... why don't we get Rob, and the three of us'll drive into Brooklyn, you know, and we show you the old neighborhood.
5 Okay, okay. Okay.	That'd be fun for yuh. Don't you think-
6 Yeah.

1 Hardly ever. Maybe three times a week.	Constantly! I'd say three times a week. Like the other night, Alvy wanted to have sex.
2 She would not sleep with me the other night, you know, it's-	And... I don't know... I mean, six months ago I-I woulda done it. I woulda done it, just to please him.
3 I mean... I tried everything, you know, I-I-I put on soft music and my- my red light bulb, and...	But the thing is-I mean, since our discussions here, I feel I have a right to my own feelings. I think you woulda been happy because... uh, uh, I really asserted myself.
4 The incredible thing about it is, I'm paying for her analysis and she's making progress and I'm getting screwed.	I don't know, though, I feel so guilty because Alvy is paying for it, so, you know, so I do feel guilty if I don't go to bed with him. But if I do go to bed with him, it's like I'm going against my own feelings. I don't know I-I can't win.
5 You know... it's getting expensive my analyst... for her analyst. She- she's making progress and I'm not making any progress. Her progress is defeating my progress.	Sometimes I think-sometimes I think I should just live with a woman.

1 I'm into garbage. It's my thing.	Boy, this is really a nice screening room. It's really a nice room.

1 Alvy.	Oh, hi, Duane, how's it goin'?
2 This is my room.	Oh, yeah?  Terrific.
3 Can I confess something?

1 Jesus, last night it was some guy honking his car horn. I mean, the city can't close down. You know, what-whatta yuh gonna do, h-have 'em shut down the airport, too? No more flights so we can have sex?	I'm too tense. I need a Valium. My analyst says I should live in the country and not in New York.
2 Well, I can't li- We can't have this discussion all the time. The country makes me nervous. There's... You got crickets and it-it's quiet... there's no place to walk after dinner, and... uh, there's the screens with the dead moths behind them, and... uh, yuh got the-the Manson family possibly, yuh got Dick and Terry-	Okay, okay, my analyst just thinks I'm too tense. Where's the goddamn Valium?

1 Oh.	Tell him.

1 Max, my serve is gonna send yuh to the showers-	Right, right, so g-get back to what we were discussing, the failure of the country to get behind New York City is-is anti-Semitism.
2 Max, the city is terribly worried.	But the- I'm not discussing politics or economics. This is foreskin.
3 No, no, no, Max, that's a very convenient out. Every time some group disagrees with you it's because of anti-Semitism.	Don't you see? The rest of the country looks upon New York like we're-we're left-wing Communist, Jewish, homosexual, pornographers. I think of us that way, sometimes, and I-I live here.
4 Max, if we lived in California, we could play outdoors every day, in the sun.	Sun is bad for yuh. Everything our parents said was good is bad. Sun, milk, red meat, college...

1 You like this house, Max?	M'hm.
2 I even brought a road map to get us to the bathroom.	Whee, you shoulda told me it was Tony Lacey's party.
3 What difference does that make?

1 Let 'im drop dead! Who needs his business?!	His wife has diabetes!
2 Di-diabetes? Is that any excuse? Diabetes?

1 Now, don't let it be so long, now.	No.

1 Oh, and there's another thing about New York. See... you-you wanna see a movie, you have to stand in a long line.	Yeah.
2 It could be freezing, it could be raining.	Yeah.
3 And here, you just-

1 Isn't Skye amazing?	She's got great tits.
2 She's a constant surprise.	And you've only just met.
3 Yeah, I know... But she's only twenty seven and...  The wisdom.  She's an old soul.  She knew that Shostakovich thing.  Did you notice?	Absolutely.  And she's got great tits.
4 Yeah, God she really does have great tits, great tits.  i can't wait to work with her.	The camera loves her.  A great actress.
5 With great tits.  I'm going to ask her if I can touch them.

1 It sounds hysterical, but Otis just rubbed up against me and I'd kind of like to change into something of yours.  You know it could be disaster.  He's so allergic.  It's terrifying.	Borrow whatever you like.
2 I'll change back before we leave.	Whatever you like.  I'm afraid it'll all be too big for you.  Are you alright, Clair?
3 I'm fine.  I'm fine.  Well, I'm a little stressed.  And I've been taking pills to get my weight down since the baby.	I'd say it was down.
4 And the doctor said they might make me a little jumpy.  I've got a ghastly headache, actually.	You want a Tylenol, or something?
5 I'd love a Xanex.  Sally, please don't tell Sophia that I'm not breast feeding.	Why would she care?
6 You know Sophia.  She's so damned judgemental.  And she's so damned... perfect.  And so fucking... serene.  Just fucking don't tell her.  Because you know Mac thinks she's God.  And I can feel him comparing.	You need to knock off the pills, Clair.
7 Just don't fucking tell her.	It's not going to come up.

1 I'm the hired help.	Fuck you.
2 I never put myself in harm's way.	Anymore.
3 No, not anymore.  Happy anniversary, scout.

1 Let me.  I'm Jeffrey.	Monica.
2 And you know our friends, how?	We live next door.
3 Oh.  You're them.	Excuse me?
4 We've heard lots about you.	You have?

1 I'm fine, babe.  I'm gonna take a little walk.  I need a minute.  Let's forget it. My life didn't pass in front of my eyes. So, it probably wasn't that close.	Probably not.
2 So, you've got lifeguard papers, or what?

1 Happy anniversary, baby.	Happy anniversary.

1 Of course we do.  We have to sign our taxes.	You can never be too early or too thin.

1 I think we should all take it tonight. Everyone's staying, stays.  No driving. That's the rule.  I love you Sally-Mae. You're going to have a fabulous time.	I'm worried about my spine.  I'm very worried about my brain and my spine.

1 No.	Okay.
2 Pretty much a disaster, tonight, wasn't it?	I guess.
3 Life gets messy.  Ugly messy.  But I don't understand you.  And I don't think I ever understood Lucy.  I don't understand throwing it away.  How do you throw all that away?  Any of it.  I want it all.  You guys want guarantees?  I want the possibilities.  And all kinds of crap comes with that.  A lot of bad shit. And I think that's okay with me because, because of the rest of the stuff.  All the good shit.  All the surprises.  It's a fucking miracle when you come down to it.  We'd have had amazing children, you and me.  We'd have had a ride.  You'd have surprised yourself.  I'll never love anybody else, you know.	Me too.
4 That's under lock and key.	Me too.

1 You lose this?	Ah there's our snookums now.

1 Are you okay?	I don't think so.  I feel.  I feel a bit funny.
2 Let's go for a walk.

1 I didn't say a word.	Time!

1 Jesus Christ, it's a fucking dog!	Don't go in, Ryan.
2 What?	Let's just go home, okay?

1 Otis!!  Shostakovich identified with the Jew.  He felt persecuted, hunted, crushed under the thumb of Stalinist imperialism.	Not to mention Andrew Zhdanov... Otis, come!!
2 Andre Zhdanov?  How the hell do you know about Andre Zhdanov?	Who doesn't know about the infamous composer's conference of 1948 where Zhdanov persecuted the leaders of Soviet Music - Shostakovich, Prokofieve, and Myaskovsky.
3 I'll tell you who doesn't know, cute girls don't know.	Do Peter Sellers again.
4 Otis you crazy dog!  Otis are you in this God forsaken Canyon?  My people are very hungry.	I just did a movie about Bob Yar, I played Gittle, the Jewish milkmaid who gets shot in the head, and they used Shostakovich's 13th Symphony.
5 Set to the poem of Yetveshenko!	Exactly!  So I dug it, and I did a lot of research.
6 Do you really, you really, like Shostakovich?	Yeah.
7 Would you, like, marry him?	If he were still alive, maybe.
8 How about someone who really really liked Shostakovich?	Are you asking me to marry you?
9 No, I'm just testing to see how deeply perverted and impulsive you are.	Very.
10 Oh good, I'm worse... Are you really twenty-two?	Who told you that?  No.  I'm twenty...  Five.

1 Panes?	From Jewish Folk Poetry, a song cycle...

1 You don't need to do that.	I don't mind...
2 Relax.  You've done enough.

1 Break's over.	This colony needs another tunnel like a hole in the ground.  Why are we even digging this thing?
2 Who cares, Z.  All I know is, we gotta dig.  We're not the ones in charge.

1 What a bunch of losers.  Mindless zombies capitulating to an oppressive system --	Wanna dance?

1 Gee, uh, could you say it a little louder, I think there are some ants in the next colony who didn't hear you.	I CAN'T DANCE WITH A WORKER!
2 That's not what you said the <u>other</u> <u>night</u> --	Quiet -- sshhh!!
3 -- At the <u>worker bar</u>!  You were pretty hot to trot then!	SSHH!!!  SSHH!!!

1 This lake is huge!  And so close to the colony!  Think of the vacation potential!	Cut me down a soft leaf so I can take a nap.
2 Listen, "Princess", you can't order me around.  Out here, you're not the boss anymore -- out here, you're just --

1 Bala, that -- that lake we found -- I think the tunnel's right underneath it!  -- Formica's going to <u>flood the</u> <u>colony</u>!!!  That's what he meant when said there were too many ants!	Oh no...

1 You just stick by old Barbatus. He'll watch out for you.  Whatsamatter, kid?  Leave a girl behind?	Yeah.  Well -- no.  She's kind of playing hard to get.  As a matter of fact, she's playing completely unattainable.  So, what's on the schedule?  A brisk walk?  a foraging expedition?
2 No -- we're going to attack the termites!	Attack?  But -- I hate attacking! It's so hostile!

1 Dammit, this tunnel is priority A-1! We can't afford <u>any delays</u> on this project!	I've never seen anything like it, General, they're they're...well, look!

1 Wow, what a spread -- you know, there's a food shortage in the rest of the colony.	Yes, and do you know <u>why</u> there's a food shortage?
2 ...Not enough food?	Negatory.  <u>Too many ants</u>.  And while we soldiers go out there, and fight, and bleed, and die for the colony, the namby-pamby workers live it up back home.

1 ...I should?	YES!!!  You know, people ask me, "Doctor, why are you always happy?" And I tell them it's mind over matter.  I don't <u>mind</u> that I don't <u>matter</u>!  Do you get it?  Do you get it?

1 You have to help me.  Please, Weaver. Think of all the things I've done for you!	I can't think of any.
2 Well I'm gonna <u>start</u> doing things for you...	Will you introduce me to some worker girls?
3 You bet!  They'll really go for a sensitive guy like you!	Maybe I'll get lucky.  You know, Z, I wouldn't do this for anyone but you...

1 Mrs. Dreyfuss, can I borrow some coffee -- and maybe an orange and a couple of eggs?	Eggs he asks me for. Oranges. What you need is a good horse-whipping.
2 Ma'am?	From me the doctor has no secrets. Poor girl -- how could you do a thing like that?
3 I didn't really do anything -- honest -- I mean, you take a girl out a couple of times a week -- just for laughs -- and right away she thinks you're serious -- marriage-wise.	Big shot! For you, I wouldn't lift a finger -- but for her, I'll fix a little something to eat.

1 I hope everything goes all right.	I hope so.  Wouldn't you know they'd call me on a day like this -- with my cold and everything --  How do I look?
2 Fine.  Wait.

1 You all right? What's the matter?	Nothing.  There are just too many people here.
2 Why don't we step into any office? There's something I want your advice about, anyway.  I have my own office now, naturally. And you may be interested to know I'm the second youngest executive in the company -- the only one younger is a grandson of the chairman of the board.

1 Miss Kubelik, I'm stronger than you are --	I just want to go brush my teeth --
2 Oh -- of course. I think there's a new toothbrush somewhere.

1 What do you call it when somebody keeps getting smashed up in automobile accidents?	A bad insurance risk?
2 That's me with men. I've been jinxed from the word go -- first time I was ever kissed was in a cemetery.	A cemetery?
3 I was fifteen -- we used to go there to smoke. His name was George -- he threw me over for a drum majorette.	Gin.

1 You can't leave yet. The doctor says it takes forty-eight hours to get the stuff out of your system.	I wonder how long it takes to get someone you're stuck on out of your system? If they'd only invent some kind of a pump for that --

1 Oh.	Aren't you meeting Mr. Sheldrake?
2 No. You know how people talk. So I decided it would be better if we didn't see each other till everything is settled, divorce-wise.	That's very wise.
3 Good night, Mr. Baxter.	Good night, Miss Kubelik.

1 Been hearing some very nice things about you -- here's a report from Mr. Dobisch -- loyal, cooperative, resourceful --	Mr. Dobisch said that?
2 And Mr. Kirkeby tells me that several nights a week you work late at the office -- without overtime.	Well, you know how it is -- things pile up.
3 Mr. Vanderhof, in Public Relations, and Mr. Eichelberger, in Mortgage and Loan -- they'd both like to have you transferred to their departments.	That's very flattering.

1 Morning, gentlemen.  Everything satisfactory? You like your office?	Oh, yes, sir. Very much. And I want to thank you --
2 Don't thank me -- thank your friends here -- they're the ones who recommended you.

1 Now you're being bright?	Thank you, sir.

1 That Kubelik -- boy!  Would I like to get her on a slow elevator to China.	Oh, yes.  She's the best operator in the building.
2 I'm a pretty good operator myself -- but she just won't give me a tumble -- date-wise.	Maybe you're using the wrong approach.
3 A lot of guys around here have tried it -- all kinds of approaches -- no dice.  What is she trying to prove?	Could be she's just a nice, respectable girl -- there are millions of them.
4 Listen to him.  Little Lord Fauntleroy!

1 Make it thirty minutes.  What do you say, Bud?	I'm all out of liquor -- and there's no clean glasses -- no cheese crackers -- no nothing.
2 Let me worry about that.  Just leave the key under the mat and clear out.	Yes, Mr. Dobisch.

1 She going to be all right, Doc?	How many pills were in that bottle?
2 It was half-full -- about a dozen or so. You going to have to take her to the hospital?

1 How's the patient?	Oh, I'm fine, Doc.
2 Not you -- Miss Kubelik.

1 Not so rough, honey.	Good night.
2 Good night?	The party's over.
3 What's the matter? Did I do something wrong?	It's an emergency -- see you some other time.

1 Please -- just let me sleep.	You can't sleep.  Come on, Fran -- open your eyes.  Let's get her walking. We've got to keep her awake for the next couple of hours.

1 I have that date -- remember?	I love you -- remember?

1 Please, Sylvia!  It's a quarter to nine!	First you can't wait to get me up here, and now -- rush, rush, rush! Makes a person feel cheap.
2 Sylvia -- sweetie -- it's not that -- but I promised the guy I'd be out of here by eight o'clock, positively.	What guy?  Whose apartment is this, anyway?
3 What's the difference?  Some schnook that works in the office.

1 Look -- you know who that is, Captain -- you know what she's saying -- you'll never see stuff that good outside of a magazine for the rest of your life.	I'm not that fond of blondes -- maybe I like brunettes --
2 Take your pick -- they all like you -- I can tell --	I like all of them --
3 Good -- like I said, take your pick.	I said I like all of them.
4 Now just a second -- I'm doing you a favor, buddy -- what're you trying to pull?

1 That's good gin.	I'm sure it is, but I had hepatitis.
2 Delta ?	No.
3 North ?	Yeah. Way north.
4 What unit were you with ?	None.
5 Rangers, eh?	Sort of.

1 What do you see?	I don't know.

1 Can I go get those mangos now?	I'll go with you in a while -- judt hold tight awhile --

1 Yeah, Chef -- go ahead -- take Lance with you --	I'll go with him --

1 Rocks, sand -- those two men who deserted.	When'd you do it?
2 While you were sleeping.

1 Jesus -- that guy's too damn much.	I wonder if that was the same copter.

1 What -- happened here.	Charlie?
2 NVA regulars. They're coming again tonight. Tet -- their big -- assault.

1 American weapons?	We took them from the dead.  Now -- I assume you want to rest, to shower. We'll attend to your repairs after dinner.

1 Where've you been riding, Lance?	I haven't surfed since I got here.
2 That's terrible -- we'll change that -- I'd like to see you work -- I've always liked your cutback; got a hell of a left turn, too.

1 Big Duke Six to Hell's Angels Four -- bring it in on along tree line and huts.	Hell's Angels Four to Big Duke Six -- we'll need green smoke -- suggest you have the FAC mark it.
2 Haven't got time, Hell's Angels -- lay it right up the tree line.

1 You know, some day this war's gonna end..	Yes, I know.

1 Gimme water.	No water.
2 You know what you're doing? You are interfering with my plans !

1 No -- no, Captain.	Which one's the Colonel's?
2 The Yater -- the clear one with the thin stringer.

1 You don't know how happy that makes me, sir.	Why?
2 Now I can get out a here -- if I can find a way out.	We'll be needing some supplies and fuel -- do you know anybody who can give me a hand?
3 I'd just clear out as soon as I could if I were you, sir. They're gonna start working on the bridge with torches again. Charlie will start throwing it in hard --	What is this bridge?
4 It's of strategic importance for keeping the highway into Bat Shan open -- the generals don't like to admit that Bat Shan is surrounded.

1 Are you warm, Captain?	The river is beautiful.

1 20   CONTINUED:  	You can pack out of here -- two, three days' hike along this river at most.  Weather should hold this early in the season.

1 First you save my ass, now you want to kill me.  Make up your goddamn mind.	134  CONTINUED:  

1 119  CONTINUED:  	How?  Nobody this far north monitors that frequency until avalanche season.  Besides, I'm surprised a tough guy like you uses fancy electronics.

1 A certain sonofabitch bastard -more-	28   CONTINUED:

1 What are you doing?	He still might be around.  I saw fresh tire tracks coming in.

1 High-tech in the wilderness. Gets me excited, too.	Come here...

1 Had no choice...  ...Given the situation.	I know.  Least you didn't shoot all of them.

1 Been driving long?	I needed a pilot's license to take the job here, so I got one in six weeks.
2 That makes the flight more interesting.

1 Most dangerous thing in the world: A regular Joe, in over his head.  You trying to prove how tough you are for me, or for yourself?	It wasn't my idea to crash the plane.
2 Let's camp.  There's grayling under this ice. I'll snare some for dinner.	We've got another two hours of daylight.
3 Pushing it is flat wrong.  All you prove is your ignorance about breaking trail.

1 Stay still.	Where's my ELT?
2 Emergency transmitter?  All your gear is back at Wilder's.	You got one?
3 It was blown up with the plane.	Too bad.  We'd be out of here in a few hours.

1 Emergency transmitter?  What happened to signal mirrors or two-tone smoke fires?	Lets us watch each other's backs over a wide area.  Only thing messed me up this time was getting arrested in the baths. ELT was in my duffel bag, not around my neck where it should've been.
2 No way they'll find you on a five-minute signal.  And no way -more-

1 All this for laying traps on private land?	You left a footprint at the Sportsmen's camp.  Only pretty sight there, Ben, 'cause the two men you didn't shoot and mutilate died of exposure.

1 I was just on my way to your ladyfriend's, but I guess she found you.	Yeah.  Sorry I barked at you last night.
2 I'm the one should be sorry... Goddamn Kenai, always out for a score.  I never should've let him go over there.

1 ...You give us a ride in the Cessna you got hangared at the pumping station, we'll be in Fairbanks in a few hours.	That's what we should've done in the first place.
2 I could've sat tight for the transport, 'til Bob came poking around.

1 Thought that door was open last night...	Quit fucking around.  Get in.

1 This is Sam Wilder, Marshal in Devil's Cauldron.  Had some killings here.  I got a suspect; be real nice if someone came and took him off my hands.	On a good day I couldn't spare a crosswalk guard.  But now, no way.  Folks're batshit with the weather turning sour.  Bring him in yourself.
2 Next plane's not coming 'til next Monday.	Sit your suspect out in the cold. He'll keep.
3 This man's friends ain't gonna look favorably on his incarceration.	So shoot him.  Won't have to feed him that way --

1 Hi...  Did you know there are doctors who come to your house?	No, I didn't.  So why are you h...

1 The table's fine if it had some cholesterol on it. Two sausages, six bacon strips, fries, three eggs over easy and coffee.	You're gonna die soon with that diet, you know that?
2 We're all gonna die soon. I will. You will. It sure sounds like your son will.

1 What about your mother?	How do you know about my mother?
2 I hear you talk when I'm waiting!!!

1 So. Anything else?	Yes. I'm going to give my queer neighbor a lift to Baltimore.
2 Okay.	Hey, what I did for you is working out?
3 What you did changed my life.

1 Hey -- you let him...	You like sad stories -- you want mine.

1 Two crab dinners and pitcher of cold beer.  Baked or fries?	Fries.
2 One baked -- one fries.

1 I don't want to hear that music right now.	What do you mean? You said you liked it.
2 I don't.	This one has a special meaning.
3 It's your car but I don't want to hear it. If that means anything.

1 No! It's certainly not. No -- I don't think so. No.	I'm gonna grab you.  I didn't mean it to be a question. I'm gonna grab you.

1 One night with me!	You think you're kidding.

1 Simon, you've got to get dressed.	What I know is that as long as you keep your work zipped up around me, I don't give a fuck what or where you shove your show. Are we being neighbors for now?

1 Take my car -- a convertible. Do you drive?	Like the wind but I'm not doing it.

1 Frank loves you. You know that... but I've spoken to him and he feels that --  -- as a businessman, with limited resources...	I'll be able to keep my apartment and studio, won't I?...  Just tell me.

1 Did you... do something to him?	Do you realize that I work at him?
2 No, I didn't.	Do you like to be interrupt when you are danging around in your little garden?
3 No...  actually, I even shut the phone off and put a little piece of cardboard in the ringer so no one can just buzz me from d...	Well, I work all the time. So never, never again interrupt me. Okay? I mean, never. Not 30 years from now... not if there's fire. Not even if you hear a thud from inside my home and a week later there's a smell from in there that can only come from a decaying body and you have to hold a hanky against your face because the stench is so thick you think you're going to faint even then don't come knocking or, if it's election night and you're excited and want to celebrate because some fudge-packer you dated has been elected the first queer President of the United States... and he's going to put you up in Camp David and you just want to share the moment with someone...  don't knock ...  not on this door. Not for anything. Got me. Sweetheart?
4 Yes. It's not a subtle point you're making.	Okay, then.

1 I haven't been sleeping. I haven't been clear or felt like myself. I'm in trouble. Some son of a bitch is burning my bridges behind my back...  But the tiredness -- boy...  Not just sleepy.	But sick -- nauseous -- where everything looks distorted and everything inside just aches -- when you can barely get up the will to complain.
2 Yeah...

1 I told you to go on in.	Look, I've got to get a hold of Frank and see where I'm hanging my hat 'cause...

1 Nothing. I just watch till something strikes me. Do anything you think of -- try different thing. Until I say, "hold that pose." Then just try and comfortably hold it.	The fact that you haven't said, "hold it" means I haven't done it right...  is that correct? I haven't done it right?
2 No...  Okay. What I do is watch and wait for, um... You ever watch someone who doesn't know you're watching...  an old woman on a bus, kids going to school and you see this flash come over them and you know immediately that it has nothing to do with anything external -- that it's in respond to a private thought they just had? They are just sort of realer and more alive. And when you notice it so are you. If you look at someone long enough, you discover their humanity.

1 Sit back.  Put your seatbelt on.	No fucking way.
2 Okay, don't.

1 No, no.  Wait.  You don't want me to jump.  You're going to jump.  I'm stuck back here until it's too late. Wham -- over!	I know you're going to jump.

1 How in the fuck do you know that?	Do you want Rath or not?

1 Deadline?	Tomorrow.  The buyer is Japanese. His retirement a condition of the bonus.

1 Get on the expressway.	Where are we going?

1 Who is that other guy?	Another contractor.
2 Someone hired both of you?	No.  They hired Bain.  The contract would have been mine, but Bain took it from me as he took the previous one.
3 So this is something between you and him?	He stole the contract knowing that I would come after him.
4 Why?	Because he is trying to retire me.
5 He wants to kill you?	Yes.
6 Why?	The nature of the business.  You remove your competition.
7 And you want to use me to get him?	Yes.
8 Forget it!	We don't have a choice.

1 He was... taken.	He was killed.

1 What will you do if this works, if we get the money?	I don't know... maybe I'll live on a boat, sail to all the places I've never been.
2 That sounds nice.

1 This is the bank.  This is the hotel.  In the morning I will enter the bank.	Check.
2 He will be hidden somewhere out here, probably somewhere low, in the crowd.  He'll stay there until he sees me enter the bank.	But he won't shoot you right then?
3 No.  It would be amateur.  A risk. He'll wait for the prime shot, that he knows is coming.  Once I'm inside, he'll move to the hotel. He'll go up the back, too much traffic in the front.

1 What are you doing?	What?
2 That's a ridiculous move.	Why?
3 Because, I'll take it.	I'm playing white, remember.  You can't tell me which pieces to move. It doesn't work that way.

1 Hi.  Did you call --	Yes.  Please come in.

1 Is that all you want?	Yes.

1 You wish to close this account today?	That's correct.
2 How would you like the funds?	American currency.
3 This will take some time.	I have all day.

1 How to make a buck!	Yeah right!....I don't know, something isn't right with this place, it's all too sterile and staged. Do you ever wonder why there's no Czechs here?
2 Because it's in English?	Yeah, but it's not just that. To the Czech mind, any movement, whether political or literary should be underground. If it isn't, then it's not radical and not worthy of a look-in.
3 But we are underground?	No you don't get it. Every cabby in town knows this joint. So where's the mystery, the danger?

1 Oh yeah, what's that?	An alternative literary venue!
2 I ain't sure poetry will go down too well here.	No, it's the whole idea behind it. How did they get this place?
3 Squatted it.	Right and not just the bar, Lubosh and his mates took the whole freakin' building.
4 So? DOUG Well, there's tons of empty buildings - why don't we get one?

1 No, but like my dad said, "There's only so many ways you can wire a plug".	He was an electrician?
2 No, he was talking about girls, I think.	That makes you an expert I guess.
3 Too right....Now the other thing we've got to do is start clearing up the rubble. Can you make a start on that?

1 It must be on the other side of this.	But how did the wall get here?
2 I don't know. This wall isn't like the rest though, it's not all that old either.

1 Afternoon!	Am I late?
2 No, not if you've got better things to do.	Who put a bee up your butt?

1 Get me a couple of beers and a salami.	We could make a start on the floor afterwards.
2 No, We aren't going to do it.	What?

1 They're good guys..... Have you seen Holly?	No, but I ran into Jahn, seems him and his friends are in big trouble with the University, they might even be expelled.
2 Damn!	Did you see a lawyer and go before a judge?
3 Yeah. I tell you, they're one big happy family over there.	What happened?
4 I don't know, I'm waiting for the transcript.	You're kidding.
5 Well, the trial's in two weeks, but I think they've already sentenced me. They just need to check if Siberia can slot me in.	WE gotta think of something.
6 Now you're using that word.	I could try and get a Western lawyer.

1 I made a deal with Josh.	What?
2 It was a condition of getting Doug out.	What are you talking about?
3 In return for Doug's freedom, I was never to see him again, I had to - it was his only chance.	Josh didn't get Doug out of jail, he did a deal in return for some computer disks we'd held onto.

1 Hey, Lawrence how are you doing mate?	Doug, haven't seen you for a while.
2 I've been around.	Have you met Holly? Josh's friend.
3 No! Look Lawrence, I've taken over the lease on a theatre downtown and I'm throwing a party tomorrow night to show it off. It's going to be for alternative arts, but I need some help to finish it off, can you put the word out?	Sure. Excellent.
4 Here's the details.

1 It's just talk, he's drunk.	No I'm not, I came to Prague looking for something - this could be it!

1 She's tired.	It's bad news when you can't even bribe kids.

1 I don't understand, it's your home?	There's nothing there for me.
2 I'm sorry about what I said, really I am. Just take me with you, I don't care where.

1 No thanks, I must go, but maybe you could get some beers for the guys.	Don't worry. Thanks.

1 Will they free me?	I don't know - maybe they are talking about it now. Mr Vitovetch is a good friend of the Judge.
2 Will this thing take long?	No, it should be over soon.
3 You mean it's started?	Of course, you can see that lady over there, she is recording everything.
4 How do I know what's being said?	I will tell you - within a week I will have the transcript and we can go through it.

1 I'd better get you to a hospital.	I'll be okay, just get me home.

1 This is your doing?	Yes, they had nothing to do with it.
2 And you broke into that room?	That's right.
3 You will wish you hadn't.	Fuck you!

1 We had a deal!	Yes, you are free to go, Karel here will drive you home.

1 Josh!	Well come on, sit down.

1 Why are there still such headlines?	This press we cannot control. Americans, I think.
2 You know everyone can be controlled Pavel. Where are you storing the personnel files?	In a building belonging to the University in the Old Town.
3 You are quite sure it's secure?	The files are in a sealed room and the University are under strict orders to stay away.
4 The storage facility will be ready within a week, I'll call you then.

1 That's one girl who can't take a hint.	Because she doesn't know what a hint is.

1 A late night or an early morning?	Late night.  You?
2 Were you with Jamie?	Yeah.
3 You sleeping with her?

1 I'm thinking.	No thinking. The doctor only gives you three seconds to decide --

1 Who are you?	Landon Carter. I was driving the car that --
2 You.	Me.

1 I know you don't want help.	Then we both know.  I'll point. You drive. Faster.

1 Like you'd know.	I do know.  Be two places at once... learn to hit a baseball or turn a cartwheel... eat breakfast with chopsticks...

1 I'm building a larger one to see the nucleus of Haley's Comet --	The dirty snowball at its core.
2 Yeah.  I'm probably not going to be around next time it comes.	In 76 years, me neither.

1 He okay?	Healthy as can be.

1 Hey.	I heard what you did. Thank you.

1 The cells in our bodies are always changing. In six or seven years all your cells have changed. You could be like a completely new person from the inside out.	That what's happening to you, only faster?

1 Come on.	Where?
2 Away from here.

1 What's the best thing I can see tonight?	Me.

1 Are you frightened?	All the time.  I feel like I have no one.

1 'Love is always patient and kind. It is never boastful or conceited -- '	That was read at my parents' wedding.

1 Did you give him a gift?	No.
2 I saw the way he looked at you. The way he kissed you.	It was a play.
3 Boys like him have -- expectations.	I have expectations, too.

1 This week.	Ever again.

1 You've been well?	Yes. You?
2 Getting by.

1 No way. No thanks. I can't do it --	-- You can and you will, Mr. Carter.

1 What's N.R.C.?	I don't know. National Cash Register?

1 Then you'll be going to school here....?	School? I never thought of school! If I went to school I could blend in with everybody else, couldn't I?

1 By the way, that reminds me...  Saturday night we're taking Grandma Stella out for Chinese food.	Eileen, Chinese food again?
2 George, if you don't want Chinese food, pick a place you want to go and make a reservation.

1 Oh, no! That was for the cafeteria! This is different!	Christ, it's a miracle I was even born! 
2 Huh?	Nothing. Look, I'll write it down for you, okay?

1 You know damn well that's not what I meant.	All I can say is, that's one helluva attitude, Mr. McFly. 'Let's explode a hundred megaton Geothermal nuclear device, just to see it.'

1 Been any place unusual in the past twelve hours?	Home, school, here... 

1 A time machine! Because of that Coke?!	Precisely! 

1 Jeez -- this is where you used to live, huh? You must have been rich!	Must have been? Used to live? I do live here.
2 Oh, yeah.

1 I told you not to interfere with any of the events of this time! Nobody's supposed to see you here! What if I was a mailman? Or a salesman?	What if you lost your keys?
2 Then I would have figured out to get back in through the events in the natural course of history! Don't you understand? The fabric of history is very delicate. Anything you do could have serious consequences!	Hey, look, gimme a break! All I did was answer the door! How's that gonna change history?
3 I don't know, but I don't want to take any chances! Now you stay here and don't do anything. Don't answer the door, don't answer the phone, don't go outside. Understand?

1 That's all taken care of.	Good. Professor Brown tested the tarp, noting in satisfaction that it was secure. I'll pick you up in front of the school at midnight. Don't be late -- we're cutting it close as it is. We've got a long drive ahead of us.

1 But if you didn't rebuild the time machine, how did I go back in time in the first place?	According to your girlfriend, Suzy Parker, you and she were at the movies. You went to the restroom and you never came out. Obviously, you stepped through an inter-dimensional time warp, created by the original operation of the time machine.

1 No... You go in there, I'll have to kill you.	What's going on?
2 Can't afford to take chances.

1 Don't you ever get bored around here?	Sometimes. The other day, though, an old boy was plowing in the field over there, found some old Spanish coins.

1 Well, Kit...	Tom...
2 Good luck to you.	Thanks.
3 I mean it.	I know you do. Good luck to you, too.

1 Oh, incidentally, my last name is Carruthers. Sounds a little too much like "druthers", doesn't it?	It's okay.
2 Well, nobody asked me what I thought. They just hung it on me.

1 My stomach's growling.	There's an old Fudgesicle over there. You want it?
2 No.

1 How you doing?	I'm fine. Kind of tired.
2 Yeah, me too.

1 Hey, why're you always walking ahead of me?	Well, why you always walking behind me?

1 What?	Nothing... I was just running off at the mouth... as usual.
2 I'm sorry. I wasn't listening.

1 Good deal... Oh, uh, we're on the run and we'd like to hang out here for a while. Couple of hours, maybe. How'd that be?	Stay as long as you like.

1 Think I'll take the juice?	Beats me.

1 Rawhide tells me Dr. Lizardo escaped...	I'm assigning a couple Blue Shields to protect you around the clock, just in case.

1 That's me. I've been ionized, but I'm okay. I'm, switching on the homing beacon, mark two minute intervals.	Buckaroo, somebody shanghaied the Professor!
2 The deuce you say.  That crate!

1 Running a little late, Buckaroo.	Let her out. In my custody.
2 Let her out?  She's a killer.

1 I lack the authority, Buckaroo Banzai.	At least tell them I'm trying!  Tell 'em something--!

1 Got a casualty list?	Just their side.  What're we gonna do with these people?  They're illegal aliens, the way I figure, been here forty years, you could throw the book at 'em...
2 And ask the American taxpayer to foot the bill?  No way.  Send 'em back to the Eighth Dimension as soon as we find the Overthruster.  It wasn't in Penny's purse...so if we have to run this joint upside down and inside out...

1 Did you have family there--? A sister?  In Cody?	I don't know. I always felt like I did, like there was another me...
2 Another 'you'?	Somewhere.  See I was taken away by the Priddies when I was a baby.  I was adopted.
3 Adopted.  I should have know. Of course. If it was a snake, it'd bit me!	What?  I don't understand you.  I don't understand anything anymore.
4 Who does?  It's a crazy mixed-up world.  Just do the best you can with what you have...

1 Not too terrific, sir.  I apologize for the interruption but something very unusual has reared its ugly head in outer space, and it looks like the Earth's caught in a crossfire.	You're gonna have to repeat that, I think, Buckaroo.

1 Pick those up, Reno.	I didn't drop 'em.

1 Now twenty seconds downrange...Perfect Tommy, how on earth is Buckaroo able to keep that thing on the ground?	She's just a damn road hugger, Allison.  Plus the man can drive.

1 If you could, I'd 	If I can. He gets jealous; he-

1 M'honey pretends to be impatient with me, Barton, but she'll put up with anything.	Not anything, Bill. Don't test me.

1 Ever talk to him?	...Once or twice. His name is Charlie Meadows.

1 Look, maybe it's none of my business, but a man with your talent  don't you think your first obligation would be to your gift? Shouldn't you be doing whatever you have to do to work again?	And what would that be, son?
2 I don't know exactly. But I do know what you're doing with that drink. You're cutting yourself off from your gift, and from me and Audrey, and from your fellow man, and from everything your art is about.	No son, thisahere moonshine's got nothin' to do with shuttin' folks out. No, I'm usin' it to build somethin'.
3 What's that?	I'm buildin' a levee. Gulp by gulp, brick by brick. Raisin' up a levee to keep that ragin' river of manure from lappin' at m'door.

1 I thought you were going to join us. Jesus, Garland, you left me alone with those people.	Don't panic, I'll join you in a minute.  What's you think of Richard and Poppy?

1 And what's your line, Mr. Meadows?	Hell no! Call me Charlie. Well Barton, you might say I sell peace of mind. Insurance is my game  door-to-door, human contact, still the only way to move merchandise.

1 Oh, yeah. An ear infection, chronic thing.  Goes away for a while, but it always comes back. Gotta put cotton in it to staunch the flow of pus. Don't worry, it's not contagious.	Seen a doctor?

1 ...All right now, when I say "Ready... wrestle!"  you try and pin me, and I try and pin you. That's the whole game. Got it?	...Yeah, okay.
2 Ready... wrestle!

1 ...Your room does that too?	I guess the heat's sweating off the wallpaper.
2 What a dump...

1 Jesus... You're leaving.	Have to, old timer. Just for a while.

1 To be honest, I don't go to the pictures much, Mr. Lipnik 	That's okay, that's okay, that's okay  that's just fine. You probably just walked in here thinking that was going to be a handicap, thinking we wanted people who knew something about the medium, maybe even thinking there was all kind of technical mumbo- jumbo to learn. You were dead wrong. We're only interested in one thing: Can you tell a story, Bart?  Can you make us laugh, can you make us cry, can you make us wanna break out in joyous song? Is that more than one thing? Okay.  The point is, I run this dump and I don't know the technical mumbo-jumbo. Why do I run it? I've got horse-sense, goddamnit. Showmanship. And also, and I hope Lou told you this, I bigger and meaner than any other kike in this town. Did you tell him that, Lou? And I don't mean my dick's bigger than yours, it's not a sexual thing  although, you're the writer, you would know more about that. Coffee?
2 ...Yes, thank you.	Lou.

1 Yes sir.	I had to call Beery this morning, let him know we were pushing the picture back.  After all I'd told him about quality, about that Barton Fink feeling. How disappointed we were. Wally was heartbroken. The man was devastated. He was  well, I didn't actually call him, Lou did. But that's a fair description, isn't it Lou?

1 Is this multiple choice?	Nine days  Tuesday 

1 Ya know, Fink, ordinarily we say anything you might remember could be helpful. But I'll be frank with you: That is not helpful.	Ya see how he's not writing it down?
2 Fink. That's a Jewish name, isn't it?

1 Mr. Lipnik, I 	This man creates for a living! He puts food on your table and on mine! THANK him for it!  Thank him, you ungrateful sonofabitch! Thank him or YOU'RE fired!

1 Take care, you hear?	Did you find out about her parents?
2 You're on leave, man.  You're on psycho leave.  I'm talking to a possible whacko here.	You know I'm whacko, Sam, what'd you find?

1 What are you doing here?	Baby-sitting.  Rookie cop.
2 What else is new?

1 How do you know Catherine Tramell saw my reports?	She knows stuff about me that only you know.
2 She must really be something.  From a clinical point of view.	What was she like in school?
3 I hardly knew her.  She gave me the creeps, though.  I don't know why.

1 What are you doing here?	Put your hands up!

1 I told you -- I quit.	It won't last.

1 Sure.	Thanks.

1 Tell me about Professor Goldstein.	There's a name from the past.
2 You want a name from the present? How about Hazel Dobkins?

1 Say -- "What do you want from me, Catherine?"	What do you want from me, Catherine?

1 How about Roxy?  Is she a fuck to the century, too?	Do you want her to join us sometime?

1 No.	No?
2 No more games, Nick.  I'm tired of playing games!

1 You still think I kill people, don't you?	No.
2 Liar.

1 Did you ever engage in sado- masochistic activity with him?	Exactly what do you have in mind, Mr. Corrigan.
2 Did you ever tie him up?	No.

1 He was walking home from work. They only lived a coupla blocks from the clinic.  Somebody drove by and shot him.	What was the weapon?
2 .38 revolver.  Never recovered.	Were there ever any suspects?
3 No suspects, no motive.  Unsolved.	Was his wife ever a suspect?
4 I had another one of you guys down here from Frisco -- about a year ago -- he asked me the same question.  What's this about anyway?	Routine.
5 Yeah, he said it was routine too. Now it's two guys saying it's routine.	Do you remember his name?
6 Nope, can't say that I do.	Nilsen?
7 That's him.

1 What's goin' down, son?	Nothin'  I'll be okay, pop.

1 It doesn't make sense.  She didn't know me three months ago.	Maybe it wasn't her that paid him. Maybe the money was for somethin' else.  How the fuck do I know? I'm just an old city cowboy tryin' not to fall outta his saddle.

1 Not unless she got up in the ring and turned into one mean sonofabitch.	Maybe she did, Gus.  Maybe she grew herself an Afro and learned a left hook and put shoe polish on her face.  Let's polygraph her again and ask her about it.

1 I love it.  She's got a hundred million bucks.  She fucks fighters and rock and roll stars.  And she's got a degree in screwing with peoples' heads.	You forgot her degree in literature. She's a writer.  She published a novel last year under a pen name. Do you want to know what it's about?

1 You knew her, didn't you?	Gus and I talked to her at Tramell's house.  All we did was write her name down.
2 I told you to stay away from Tramell.	Yeah.  But you didn't tell me to stay away from her car.

1 He died -- about five or six years ago.	He was shot.

1 Jean Michel, this is Mary Boone. She's got the great new gallery.	Yeah, I met her already.

1 After the show we should take a nice long vacation. Maybe go to Hawaii. That's what I'm gonna do. I'm going to give up painting and start playing music again. I wanna sing.	That would be a pity because you're a real painter.

1 It's great that people are interested, but if anyone's going to buy anything, I'll handle it for you. Everything goes through the gallery, even if they come to your studio.	Sure.

1 Jean Michel... Crawling from the wreckage?	I need a dealer.
2 You have a bunch of them, don't you? Albert Milo walks in from another room.

1 Paint it out.	Out?
2 Yeah... Maybe just his arms.  Put some Cerulean Blue there.

1 Come on, Jean. Get rid of your cigarette. Concentrate.	I am... On Gina.  Fuck  I didn't think we were actually gonna do this.
2 Concentrate on the ball. Shoot.

1 I don't really have any problems.	Good. What do you have?
2 What's your fuckin' problem? You get a girlfriend and a little attention and then start acting all uppity with me.	'Uppity?' Like as in 'uppity nigger?'

1 ... I'll buy you some new ones.	You don't have any fucking money..

1 So. Are you ready? I start Columbia next fall. Of course, there's like, a year of pre-med stuff, but  whatever. I'm really excited.  And: Rene gave me a job as his secretary. His poems are getting published.	How is he?
2 Pretty much the same.

1 Hi.	Hi.
2 I've seen you before. I like your paintings a lot. Your hair was different.	You like your dad's paintings?
3 Some of them.	Stand still.

1 Fuck band practice... If you're gonna be a painter you're gonna have to break a few hearts  you don't wanna be like Tony Bennett..	Tony Bennett... What do you mean?
2 Singing on stage and painting in your spare time.	I didn't know Tony Bennett painted.
3 My point exactly.

1 YO! Jean, this is Ramellzee.	Yo... You know why Rammellzee's here, don't you?
2 Uh-oh!	I'm here for an interrogation. You've been called a graffiti artist and I wanna know why. All I see are scribble scrabble abstractions!

1 Where's the fire?	"Shreck's."  You --

1 Once you were their freak, now these clowns do your bidding. Must feel pretty good.	Better than you know, Bat-boy.
2 What're you really after?	Ah, the direct approach.  I admire that in a man with a mask.  But you don't really think you'll ever win, playing it your way ..?
3 Things change.

1 ... Maybe I'll watch it on TV.	"We"?  You and...
2 ... and me.  No, that's be me and me.  Is that what I said?	Yes and no...

1 Hmm.  Primitive ventilation.	Damn those Carny bolsheviks the other night, throwing bricks at my windows --
2 No.  No glass on the inside.	Weird, huh?

1 I'll warm ya!  I got hot mitts --!	Down, Oswald.  We have to talk.  You see we've got something in common.
2 Appetite for destruction? Contempt for the czars of fashion? Wait don't tell me ... Naked sexual charisma?	Batman.  The thorn in both our sides, the fly in our ointment.
3 Huh?  You're implying I'm some kinda psycho criminal?

1 You buy this "blurry" business?	Women... nothing surprises me, Chip. Excepting your late mother... Who even knew Selina had a brain to damage?  Bottom line:  she tries to blackmail us, we drop her out a higher window.  Meanwhile I got badder fish to fry.  Yeah -- Oswald, please.

1 Bu ... wh ... I ... I mean ...	Yes, adulation is a cross to bear. God knows <u>I</u> know.  But someone's got to supplant our standing-in- the-way-of-progress Mayor and don't deny it, Mr. Cobblepot, you've got the magic!
2 Max, elections happen in November. Is this not late December, or have I inhaled too much swamp gas in my time?

1 ... Where did curiosity get the cat?	I'm no cat.  I'm just an assistant. A <u>secretary</u> --
2 And a very, very good one.	Too good?

1 I'm sorry.  I was too late.	Too late for what, dear child?
2 I came to give you your freedom, a chance to live the life you choose. The same gift you gave me.	I have been part of the greatest adventure ever know.  I have found purpose here, and the family I could never have.

1 But I can't can I?	No, my boy.  I'm afraid none of us can.

1 Alfred, are you...?	Rather disappointed at how poorly I taught you proper housekeeping.  And quite well, it seems.  Thanks to you, son.  Thanks to you all.

1 Youwsa!  Nothing but air.	Batgirl, Baatgirl, Baatgirl.

1 Nice suit.  And today you are?	Nightwing.  Scourge of darkest evil.
2 This is all about fashion for you, isn't it?	It's the gear.  Chicks love the gear.

1 No beauty...	Just the beast.

1 No!?	Umm.  What I mean is...no plans at the moment...
2 But soon...

1 I need the Wayne Diamonds.	We gonna trap ourselves a snowman?
2 Absolutely.  Just as soon as you take ten hours training in the simulator.	Whoa, I made a mistake.  I'm sorry. Don't go all protective on me.  It won't happen again.
3 Dick, you were reckless.  You could have been killed.	I'm fine.  See.  Me.  here.  Alive. How are we gonna work together if you're never going to trust me?

1 No gun.  How disarming.	I wonder if I can get a cell with a view of the gardens?
2 Dear daisy, don't despair.

1 Prepare for a bitter harvest. Winter has come at last.	Not good.

1 Dr. Isley?  Pamela?  You look great. Especially for a dead woman.	Hello, Jason.  I think I've had a change of heart.

1 Maybe they're right.	Which `they' might that be, sir?
2 Jack Napier's dead. My parents are avenged. The Wayne Foundation contributes a small fortune to police and crime prevention programs.

1 May I help you, Master Grayson?	How come this is the only locked door around this museum? What's back there?
2 Master Wayne's dead wives.

1 Welcome to my parlor said the Riddler to the Bat. How's tricks?	No more tricks, Edward. Release Chase and Dick. This is between you and me.

1 How can I help you, Mr. Wayne?	Somebody's been sending me love letters. Commissioner Gordon thought you might give me your expert opinion.

1 The style of the letters I'm getting matches those found at the crime sites. Why would The Riddler be sending me riddles?  Who's your decorator? U-Haul?	Sorry. I haven't even had time to unpack. Instant coffee okay?

1 The last entry read, Bruce insists on seeing a movie tonight.  Bruce insists. I made them go out. I made them take me to the movie. To that theater...  It was my fault. I killed them.	Oh God, Bruce, you were a child. You weren't responsible.
2 ...Not the bat?	What?
3 I always thought it was the bat that scared me that night that changed my life. But it wasn't. The real fear was hiding underneath: what I read in the journal, that my parents' deaths were my fault. That's what I couldn't remember. That's the crime I've been paying for all these years.	What are you talking about?
4 Chase. There's something I need to tell you--

1 Who is The Batman, Edward?	Can't tell if you don't say please.
2 You're right, Edward. I didn't mean to be impolite. Please.

1 How'd you find us?	You _are_ Two-Face, you would need to face both rivers, both uptown and downtown simultaneously. Only one spot in Gotham serves these bi- zonal, bi-coastal needs...
2 Congratulations. You get to die on the dean's list.

1 We want to dust him. We truly want to dust him bad.	Oh yes, and certainly _WE_ will!

1 Like your boyfriend. He's kinda hot.	Take me. Let the boy go.
2 Gosh, I could kill you, but then you'd miss my party. And you, Batman -- you're the guest of honor!	What are you talking about?
3 Batman! Don't you even recognize your old pal Jack? After all...  ... You made me what I am today.

1 The Joker is a murderer. And you were as good as dead. So --	Look, I appreciate what you did for me. But this is my job. And I'm keeping those pictures.
2 All right, I'll develop the photos. Anything I don't want is yours.	How do I know you won't keep them all?
3 I'll take you with me.

1 I assume in my usual charming manner I've just insulted the host.  Alexander Knox.	Bruce Wayne.  -- I've read your work.  I quite like it.
2 Great.  Give me a grant.	I might consider it if you introduce me to Miss Vale.

1 I'm sorry, Bruce, I Just can't seem to get a handle on this conversation.	Vicki, if I say anything cryptic, or... ambiguous, I think you should put the most flattering possible interpretation on it.  Because even if it doesn't sound that way... that's how I'll mean it.

1 It's like the last time. He sent me a present before he --	Very thoughtful. Don't touch it.

1 SOMEBODY'S KILLED THE POWER!!	WHAT?
2 SOMEBODY'S KILLED THE --	WHAT??

1 You shouldn'ta turned the gun on that kid, man.  You shouldn'ta --	Do you want this money or don't you?  Now shut up!  Shut up --

1 All right, then. Here's the deal. Total amnesty... and the sum of ten million dollars, payable in --	Ten million dollars. Ten mi -- YOU CHEAPSKATES! I've just wiped out the stock market. I've cost you billions!  I want ten million and one.
2 Please! We'll talk. Just tell us what you expect.	Goddammit, I expect to be treated like and ARTIST. GET OFF MY SCREEN!!

1 God, Vick, a girl could get hurt doing this.	A girl could get killed - - so they tell me.  What's new and hot in Gotham City?
2 Oh, it's too good.  We got a six-foot bat that swoops out of the night and preys on evildoers.	Evildoers, huh?  Big or small?
3 Small so far.  I think he's leaving the big fish for Harvey Dent.	Our next D.A. -- I hear Bruce Wayne is throwing a fundraiser.  Did you get your invitation yet?
4 Oh, absolutely.  Bruce and I are very close.

1 Yep.  He watched the whole thing happen - - Recognize the beat cop?  Jim Gordon	Oh, Bruce...
2 Something like this -- what do you suppose this could drive a guy to?

1 Jennifer can stay and look after Kevin	Sounds great.  Excellent.  Though-, Ahm... there's this guy who's coming to work at the Gallery, from England...
2 Yeeees?	And they asked me if we'd like to ... you know... put him up for a while.
3 There aren't hotels?	Yes, there are hotels.  They just thought maybe it'd be nice for him to stay with a real American family.  Popcorn, waffles, all that stuff.
4 And what did you say?	I said I'd check with you.

1 Ali?  What's wrong?	Your face smells like a foot.

1 Here, let me do that.	No, I'm fine.

1 Seems to be a problem with the door. Where's the picture gone?	Ahm.....
2 What?  What?

1 Everything okay, David?	Yes.  Ahm.  I was just wondering where my English house guest had got to.
2 He's just parking the Governor's car.	Great - keep him out of trouble.

1 So, why not haul your ...  nice little ass into this room and explain to me and my wife why our precious daughter is going to be absolutely fine because of all the fantastic intelligence and attention you are going to give her case.	Okay, sir.  Certainly.  Good.

1 Well, congratulations.  Isn't that great, David?	Certainly is.

1 As you can see, security's pretty tight in this section.  Nobody gets past Elmer here.  Isn't that right?	Not in one piece anyway.  I see Mrs Whistler as kind of ... like my own dear mother.  I'd kill any man that tried to interfere with her.  The Vice President here will vouch for that.

1 what a pleasure, Governor.  Welcome.	Hi, Grierson, forgive the war paint.  Going on To my regiment/s reunion after.
2 Not at all, Governor.  Very striking.

1 Huh huh huh. He said "anus."	Entert-ain...us...an-us...Oh yeah! Heh heh. Anus. Heh heh.

1 Dammit! Huh huh. That chick wants me.	Aggghg! We're gonna die! We're all gonna die!

1 So, uh, huh huh. Are we gonna score now?	Me first!
2 Forget it, bunghole!

1 Beavis, huh huh, what'er you doing?	My butt's bothering me!
2 You should kick your butt's ass. Huh huh huh.

1 Uh...	Dammit!!!! Dammit!!!!

1 Well where is she?!	Could you, like, tell her we're ready to score?

1 Beavis.	That's alright. I'd rather not know your real names anyways. I'm Muddy. Look, I'm gonna get right to the point. I'll pay you ten grand plus expenses, all payable after you do her...

1 You must bow down to the Almighty Bunghole.  Heh heh, this is cool.  Bungholio-o-o-o-o-o!	He's jerkin' us off. I think we're gonna have to take him out. Get ready to fire on my orders...  This is your last chance. Give us the unit now...
2 Why does everyone wanna see my schlong?  I am the one-and-only-almighty-bungholiooo!	OK boys. Get ready to fire on the count of three.  I'm gonna give you three seconds...

1 What the hell...? Bork! That bus we picked up. Where was it headin'?	D.C., Chief.
2 Jesus jumped-up... Bork, can you imagine what would happen if they set that thing off in our nation's capital, or even worse, if they sold it to some damned foreigner at that conference.  Well, it's not gonna happen!

1 She's holed up in a hotel room in Las Veags. Your flight leaves in a couple of hours. Now c'mon, I'll drive you to the airport.	Holed up. Huh huh huh. Holed.

1 Really? That's where we're from.	Well, then you know what I'm talking about. Anyway, here's the story. I scored with these two chicks. True story.
2 You scored with two chicks?!	Yeah, they were sluts. Huh huh huh.

1 Jane said we should sell the house to someone with a family.	Ah, the ever-tactful Jane.  Let's just relax about having children.

1 I don't like situations like this. I hate it when I'm not in control. So just tell me the basics.	This book isn't arranged that way. What do you want to know?
2 There are a thousand things... Why did you disappear when you walked off the front porch?  Is this a punishment?  Are we halfway to heaven or are we halfway to hell? And how long is this going to <u>last</u>?	I don't see anything about 'Rewards and Punishments' or 'Heaven and Hell.'  This book reads like stereo instructions!  Listen to this... 'Geographical and Temporal Perimeters... Functional perimeters vary from manifestation to manifestation.'  This is going to take some time.

1 Look in the index... maybe there's, like an emergency number or something.	Not really...  what's this?

1 I feel really stupid.	It's <u>not</u> stupid.  We're ghosts. Do you want this woman for breakfast for 125 years?  Moan louder!

1 Honey.  Let's go.	Go?  What d'ya mean?  We need help.
2 No, we don't.  We can work something out ourselves.  We just have to try harder.

1 Oh, Adam, don't tease her.  You never got an A in science in your life!	All right.

1 Did you get the paint?	I got it.  And I took pictures of the new church for you, too.

1 <u>Barbara</u>?!!	Now, let's get rolling!

1 I don't like Charles Deetz particularly, but you could have <u>killed</u> him.	Hey, I've been in a frigging bottle for six hundred years.  I was out.  Every dog has his day. This is my town.  I need a night to howl.

1 If I had seen a ghost at your age, I would have been frightened out of my wits.	You're not gross.  Why were you wearing a sheet?
2 We're practicing.

1 Mr. and Mrs. Maitland?  I've come for the last time.  Where are you?  Barb...	They're dead.

1 Yes, of course you are.  Well, Otho had an intuition.  Call it a hunch -- that it was going to be a fabled monstrosity of a house.  And it certainly is.  Charles, you're lucky the Yuppies are buying condos, so you can afford what I'm going to have to do to this place. We are talking <u>from the ground</u> <u>ups'ville</u>!	That's fine, Otho.  Just keep me out of it.  I am here to relax and clip coupons.  And goddamnit, I mean to do it.

1 Yeah, maybe if he's nice, he'll let me hang myself from a rope in his barn.	Lydia, we're the first trickle! In a couple of years this whole town will be <u>filled</u> with people like us.

1 Now, let's get back to business. I want to get Maxie Dean and Sarah up here immediately.  I can make history here!  I'm going to turn this sleepy little backward town into a leading supernatural research center... and amusement park.	I cannot believe this.
2 Delia will cook...

1 I can't believe you are doing this to me!  <u>Ghosts</u>.  I am giving a dinner party for seven people tonight.  Otho has agreed to come back for the demolition of the attic.  My agent, Bernard, is bringing some woman who writes for <u>Architectural Digest</u>.  In fact, no one here tonight has not been in <u>Vanity Fair</u>.  Except you.	I <u>told</u> them you were too mean to be afraid.
2 Don't you <u>dare</u> talk to others about me.  I'm an <u>artist</u>!  The only thing that scares me is being embarrassed in front of my friends.  Do you know how hard it is to get civilized people to set foot in this part of Connecticut? Not a solitary word of this pubescent tripe to anyone.

1 What do you think?	Viridian?
2 Viridian?  What is...?

1 Are they still here, Otho?	Oh, they're still here.  They're Just not showing up.

1 Perhaps if I were properly motivated.	That's slavery and murder.  You don't know these people.  They're just like you and me.  They're nice people!

1 Chauncey, there you are. What are you doing on that leg?	It's fine today, Robert.
2 Shame on you, Chauncey - you should let me be the judge of that.  Please, sit in the chair.

1 Some pain is to be expected...  ... And I think what would be best for the two of you is a good night's rest.  ... It's late, I'm afraid it's time for my patients to prepare for bed.	We have common foes, Chauncey - kid lawyers and our physician!

1 I don't think that's entirely true, Grover.	And what do the boys around Intelligence think?
2 Well, Mr. President... They don't quite know what to think.	Gentlemen, needless to say, there is going to be a full Congressional investigation of your respective operations.  Good night.

1 May I ask your name?	My name is Chance.
2 Pardon me, was that Mr. Chance?	No. I'm a gardener.
3 Oh... Mr. Gardiner... Mr. Chauncey Gardiner... You're not related to Basil and Perdita Gardiner are you?	No, Eve. I'm not related to Basil and Perdita.
4 Oh. Well, they're just a wonderful couple, we've been friends for years. We visit their island quite often.

1 Chauncey!	Hello, Eve.
2 Your leg must be getting better.	Yes. It's feeling much better now.
3 Good. I'm glad to hear that.  ... How did you like meeting the President?	Fine. He's very nice.
4 Yes, he is. I'm sorry I didn't get to see him.

1 ... You know, Chauncey... I want us to be...  I want us... You and I to become... close... I want us to become very close, you know...?	Yes, Eve. I know that.

1 Hello, Mr. Gardiner. This is Sid Courtney, Washington Post.	Hello, Sid.
2 I'm sorry to disturb you, Mr. Gardiner, I know you must be very busy.	No. I'm not busy.
3 Then, I'll be brief. I covered the President's speech at the Financial Institute today, and since the Post would like to be as exact as possible, we would appreciate your comments on the meeting that took place between Mr. Rand, the President and yourself.	The President is a nice person. I enjoyed it very much.
4 Good, sir. And so, it seems, did the President - but we would like to have some facts; such as, uh... What exactly is the relationship between yourself and that of the First American Financial Corporation?	I think you should ask Mr. Rand that.
5 Of course. But since he is ill I'm taking the liberty of asking you.	Yes, that is correct. I think you should ask Mr. Rand that.

1 So you know your Krylov in Russian, do you? Mr. Gardiner, I must confess I had suspected as much all along - I know an educated man when I meet one!	Oh, good.
2 Yes, it is very good!	Yes, it is.  Would you tell me your name again, please?
3 Ho! Ho! A dash of American humor! Vladimar Skrapinov!	Yes. I like that name very much.
4 And yours, sir - Chauncey Gardiner!  How poetic! Chauncey, a name of uncertain meaning! And Gardiner, a bit of the French, a suggestion of a stroll through the flowers! A beautiful name, my friend!

1 It's a very pleasant room, Ben.	Yes, I'm sure it is. That's what they say, anyway.

1 We could do it now, we can go upstairs.  ... Please, it's time for us. Come upstairs.	I like to watch.
2 Watch? You mean just watch me? Doing it alone?	Yes. I like to watch very much.
3 Well, if that's what you want, then I want it too.  We can go this way.	I want to tell Eve.
4 Tell Eve? You mean Mrs. Rand?	Yes.
5 Oh, you can tell her later. She'll never miss you in this crowd.

1 I am allowed to go to the attic and select any of the Old Man's suits. They all fit me very well. I can also take his shirts, shoes and coats.	It is quite amazing how those clothes have come back into style.
2 Yes. I have seen styles on television.

1 ... That is a very small room.	Yes sir, I guess that's true smallest room in the house.
2 Yes. It seems to be.

1 Come now, Mr. Gardiner, before his speech at the Financial Institute the President consulted with you and Benjamin Rand, did he not?	Yes. I was there with Ben.
2 I know that, Mr. Gardiner.	Yes.
3 Well, let me rephrase the question; the President compared the economy of this country to a garden, and stated that after a period of decline a time of growth would naturally follow. Do you go along with this belief?	Yes, I know the garden very well. I have worked in it all my life. It is a good garden and a healthy one; its trees are healthy and so are its shrubs and flowers, as long as they are trimmed and watered in the right seasons. The garden needs a lot of care. I do agree with the President; everything in it will grow strong, and there is plenty of room in it for new trees and new flowers of all kinds.

1 Have you served in the Army?	No, Thomas. But I have seen the Army on television.

1 Do you agree with Ben, Mr. Gardiner? Are we finished? Or do you think we can stimulate growth through temporary incentives?	As long as the roots are not severed, all is well and all will be well in the garden.
2 ... In the garden?	That is correct. In a garden, growth has its season. There is spring and summer, but there is also fall and winter. And then spring and summer again...
3 ... Spring and summer...  Yes, I see... Fall and winter.  Yes, indeed...  Could you go through that one more time, please, Mr. Gardiner?

1 Eve, child! How nice of you to come.	Hello, Sophie.

1 Yes? What have you found?	We have nothing on him, Ambassador Skrapinov.
2 Quietly, please. Mr. Gardiner, for one, understands our language.	Sorry, Comrade Ambassador.
3 What do you mean there is nothing? That's impossible.	There is no information available on the man before he moved into Benjamin Rand's. It has proven to be such a difficult task that it has resulted in the loss of one of our agents to the United States Government.

1 I just wondered if you had gone over my speech, Ben.	Yes, I did.
2 ... Well?	Overall - pretty good. But, Mr. President, I think it's very dangerous to resort to temporary measures at this stage of the game.
3 Well, Ben... I...	I sympathize with your position, Mr. President, I know how difficult it is to be straightforward, the reaction to such a speech could be chaos.
4 That's too big a risk, I can't take the chance.

1 When you say, I can be somebody else, what do you mean exactly?	Exactly that. We can put you inside someone else's body for fifteen minutes.
2 Oh, this is just the medical breakthrough I've been waiting for. Are their any side effects? Please say no! Please say no!

1 Don't be ridiculous. There is no such thing as a portal into someone else's brain.	Brain. soul, I'm telling you, Lotte. I was right inside him looking out. We're going to be rich.
2 I want to try.	What?
3 I want to be John Malkovich. Tomorrow morning. Plus I'd like to meet this partner of yours.	Well, you know we're going to be very busy tomorrow. I'll tell you what. Let's do it tonight. Right now.
4 Now?	Yeah. We'll do it right now. On the way to Lester's house.

1 What about Maxine?	Fuck Maxine.
2 We wish.

1 Holy shit, yes!	Holy shit, yes!
2 Holy shit! He said what I said!	Holy shit! He said what I said!

1 Don't toy with Floris, Schwartz. Why, if I were eighty years younger, I'd box your ears.	I wasn't toying with her, sir. I was just... How old are you?
2 One hundred and five. Carrot juice.  Lot's of it. I swear, it's almost not worth it. I piss orange. Oh, and I, have to piss sitting down... like a godamn girly... every fifteen minutes. But nobody wants to die, Schwartz.	I'll keep that in mind, sir.
3 No sir-e-bob, I don't die. But what I do is get older, wrinkled like a former plum that's become the wrinkled prune you see before you. Oh, to be a young man again, maybe then Floris would care for me.	The elderly have so much to offer, sir. They are our link with history.
4 I don't want to be your godamn link, damn you. I want to feel Floris' naked thighs against my own. I want to know passion. I want my body to inspire lust in that beautiful, complex woman. I want her to shiver in a spasm of ecstasy when I penetrate her. Oh, God, the agony of the flesh, Schwartz.	Dr. Lester, while I am flattered that you share your feelings with me, I believe perhaps the workplace is not the most suitable environment for this type of discussion.
5 All right. Meet me at the Juicy-Juice Juice Bar after work today and I'll spill my goddamn guts for you.

1 I like you. I don't know what it is exactly.	My tits?
2 No, no, it's your energy or your attitude or the way you carry yourself or...	Christ, you're not a fag are you? Because I don't want to be wasting my time.

1 Okay. Here it is.  Ever want to be someone else? Now you can. No kidding. Only two hundred dollars for fifteen minutes. Visit J.M. Inc., Mertin-Flemmer Building. etc., etc.	Sounds good. Oblique but intriguing. Phone it in.

1 Hello, Don.	Hello. Wendy.
2 Don, I was wondering, do you know why our workplace has such low ceilings?	It's an interesting story, Wendy. Many years ago in the late 1800's, James Mertin, an Irish ship captain looking to invest in the future of our great country, came to this town and decided to erect an office building.

1 I missed you. I'm sorry. Tell me the plan.	Well, if Mantini wins, Schwartz will leave Malkovich, right? So, if he needs it, I help Mantini's performance a bit, give him an edge. Spice up the show.
2 Can you do that? I mean, do you know anything about puppetry?	I am the Devil, Lester. I think I can handle it.
3 I was just asking. No disrespect intended.	Fine. Let's drop it.
4 Fine. I mean, it's not like I was doubting you, it's just that I know puppetry is a skill that takes a long time to acquire.	Fine. I'm not mad. Let's just drop it.
5 Fine. Your mail's on the kitchen table. Mostly junk. Oh, there's a letter from Alex Trebek.

1 You know I think it pays to leave juice-making to the trained professionals. You look terrible, my dear.	Craig stole Maxine from me, Dr. Lester.
2 Hmmm, a lesbian, are you? I must inform you that I find that highly arousing.	No, you don't understand. I've been inside Malkovich when I'm with Maxine...
3 What?! That is not allowed. My God, you are supposed to be one of us. You know you must never partake of Malkovich by yourself!	No, I didn't know that.
4 Oh, didn't anyone show you the indoctrination video?	No.
5 Oh, sorry. Right this way.

1 Oh my darling. Oh my sweetheart.	I love you, Lotte.
2 Maxine...

1 So, do you enjoy being an actor?	Oh sure. It's very rewarding...

1 Stay in him forever?	No!  But how will we make a living, my love, if our clientele doesn't have access to our product?
2 Well, we'll have all the money in Malkovich's bank account, plus he still gets acting work occasionally.	No! Please!  Shut up, will you? We're trying to think here.  It is sort of like being a puppeteer. I like that about it.
3 No one would ever have to know its not him.	Wait a minute! What if everybody knew? What if we presented Malkovich as the world's most complicated puppet and me as the only puppeteer sophisticated enough to work him? We'd wipe the floor with the Great Mantini!
4 Oh, Craiggy, that's brilliant!

1 Captain Mertin?	What want ye, girl child?
2 I am not a child, Captain Mertin, but rather an adult lady of miniature proportions.	I see. Well, it is not my fault that thou art tiny. So if it is charity yer after, then be gone with ye, ye foul demon.
3 I am not asking for alms, but rather the ear of a kind man with a noble heart.	Aye. Speak then if ye must.
4 Captain Mertin, surely I am a God-fearing Christian woman like yourself, but alas, I am afraid that the world was not built with me in mind. Door knobs are too high, chairs are unwieldy, high-ceilinged rooms mock my stature. Nor am I a marrie lady, Captain. after all, who would marry a person of my diminutiveness? So I am forced to work for my few pennies a week as an optometrist. Why cannot there be a place for me to work safe and comfortable?

1 ...All I remember is how she loved the bottom of burned bread. Her little hands...I wouldn't know 'em if they slapped me".	..."Here. Look here. See this mark? If you can't tell me by my face, look here."

1 Well, is it now? How you getting along?	Don't pay to complain.
2 You on your way home?	No. Got me an afternoon job at the shirt factory. Figure between that and my night work at the Bodwins I might be able to put something away for me and mama.
3 They treating you right over at the Bodwins?	More than all right. Miss Bodwin, she teach me stuff..Book stuff. She says I might go to Oberlin. She's experimenting on me.

1 Should I wake her?	No, let her rest.
2 She likes to see you off in the morning.	I'll make sure she does. But first I'm going  make up a nice, big breakfast against that cold outside.
3 Won't you be late for work?	Don't matter. First time I'll be late in nine years. No great trouble..Whatever goes on out there goes on with or without me showing up on time... don't matter...  The world is in this room, baby. This is all there is and all there needs to be.

1 Somebody new there. A woman. Thought you might know who she is.	Ain't no new Negroes in this town I don't know about. What she look like? You sure that wasn't Denver?
2 I know Denver.	You sure?
3 I know what I see.	Might see anything at all at 124.
4 True.	Better ask Paul D.
5 Can't locate him.	He's sleeping in the church.
6 The church!	Yeah. Asked Rev. Pike if he could stay in the cellar.
7 It's cold as charity in there! What he do that for? Any number'll take him in.	Can't nobody read minds long distance. All he have to do is ask somebody.
8 Why? Why he have to ask? Can't nobody offer? What's going on? Since when a black man come to town have to sleep in the cellar like a dog?!	Unrile yourself, Stamp. It's only a few days he been there.
9 NO! Shouldn't be no days! You know all about it and don't give him a hand? That don't sound like you, Ella. Me and you been pulling colored folk out the water more'n twenty years! Now you tell me you can't offer a man a bed?! A working man who can pay his own way?	He ask, I give him anything.
10 Why's that necessary all of a sudden?	I don't know him that well.
11 You know he's colored? What else there to know?	Stamp, don't tear me up this morning! I don't feel like it.
12 It's her, ain't it?	Her who?
13 Sethe. He took up with her and stayed in there and you don't want nothing to-	Hold on! Don't jump if you can't see bottom!
14 Girl, give it up! We been friends too long to act like this.

1 What, baby?	She left me. She's gone again.
2 Aw, girl. Don't cry...Me and you, we got more yesterday than anybody. We need some kind of tomorrow...	She was my best thing.

1 Manolo will load it into your car for you, uh, Dude.	It's the LeBaron.

1 A dick, man!  And let me tell you something: I dig your work. Playing one side against the other--in bed with everybody--fabulous stuff, man.	I'm not a--ah, fuck it, just stay away from my fucking lady friend, man.
2 Hey hey, I'm not messing with your special lady--	She's not my special lady, she's my fucking lady friend.  I'm just helping her conceive, man!
3 Hey, man, I'm not--	Who're you working for?  Lebowski? Jackie Treehorn?
4 The Gundersons.	The?  Who the fff--
5 The Gundersons.  It's a wandering daughter job.  Bunny Lebowski, man. Her real name is Fawn Gunderson. Her parents want her back.

1 Yeah.	We have the urn.

1 Where you going, Dude?	I'm going home, Donny.
2 Your phone's ringing, Dude.	Thank you, Donny.

1 Burkhalter.	I told that kraut a fucking thousand times I don't roll on shabbas.
2 It's already posted.	WELL THEY CAN FUCKING UN-POST IT!

1 Who's in pyjamas, Walter?	Shut the fuck up, Donny.  Not a bunch of fig-eaters with towels on their heads tryin' to find reverse on a Soviet tank.  This is not a worthy--

1 Ahh, not so good, man.	One a those days, huh.  Wal, a wiser fella than m'self once said, sometimes you eat the bar and sometimes the bar, wal, he eats you.
2 Uh-huh.  That some kind of Eastern thing?	Far from it.
3 Mm.

1 Who the fuck are you, man!  Come on, man!	Relax, man!  No physical harm intended!
2 Who the fuck are you?  Why've you been following me?  Come on, fuckhead!	Hey, relax man, I'm a brother shamus.

1 Roy Orbison. . . Pink Floyd.	Huh?  Autobahn.  A-u-t-o.  Their music is a sort of--ugh--techno-pop.

1 So...that doctor.	Exactly.  What happened to your face? Did Jackie Treehorn do that as well?

1 Come on Walter, it's just--it's Smokey.  So his toe slipped over a little, it's just a game.	This is a league game.  This determines who enters the next round- robin, am I wrong?

1 I figure it's easy money, it's all pretty harmless.  I mean she probably kidnapped herself.	Huh?

1 FUCK.	What'd he say?  Where's the hand- off?
2 There is no fucking hand-off, Walter! At a wooden bridge we throw the money out  of the car!	Huh?
3 We throw the money out of the moving car!

1 But Walter, we didn't make the fucking hand- off!  They didn't get, the fucking money and they're gonna-- they're gonna--	Yeah yeah, "kill that poor woman."

1 Fuck me, man!  That kid's already spent all the money!	Hardly Dude, a new 'vette?  The kid's still got, oh, 96 to 97 thousand, depending on the options.  Wait in the car, Donny.

1 Sure you'll see some tank battles. But fighting in desert is very different from fighting in canopy jungle.	Uh-huh.
2 I mean 'Nam was a foot soldier's war whereas, uh, this thing should be a fucking cakewalk.  I mean I had an M16, Jacko, not an Abrams fucking tank.  Just me and Charlie, man, eyeball to eyeball.	Yeah.
3 That's fuckin' combat.  The man in the black pyjamas, Dude.  Worthy fuckin' adversary.

1 You make everything a fucking travesty!	Dude, I'm--it was an accident!

1 Huh?  No, she, she hit me right here.	I understand sir.  Could you slide your shorts down please?

1 Well, she's back.  No thanks to you.	Where's the money, Lebowski?

1 Smokey Huh?	Over the line, Smokey!  I'm sorry. That's a foul.
2 Bullshit.  Eight, Dude.	Excuse me!  Mark it zero.  Next frame.
3 Bullshit. Walter!	This is not Nam.  This is bowling. There are rules.

1 Seems like he's doing me a favor, then.	You're missing the point.  Their vampire victims don't die.  They turn.  They become carriers.  If the Reapers continue unchecked, there could be thousands of them before the month is over.  Do the math.

1 No hemoglobin left. Their metabolisms are too fast.  They burn out.  That's why they're having to feed so often.  Their systems are self destructing.	If that's true, what about Nomak?  He's been alive longer than the others.
2 Nomak's different.  He's the carrier.  There's something driving him beyond the Thirst.  Something we're missing.

1 You're hurting me.	Pain cuts the deepest, isn't that what you said?

1 I thought you were supposed to be watching our backs.	Ran into a little Reaper trouble myself.

1 Must be hundreds of these skeletons here.	So?
2 So I think you people may have underestimated how many Reapers you're dealing with.

1 So you're going to do this?	Keep your friends close and your enemies closer.  Isn't that how the saying goes?

1 I would hate to think you were losing your perspective.  Who do you think God favors in the web?  The spider or the fly?	Nomak said something to Blade in Greek. Athelfiki singenia ex amato.  Where did he learn that?
2 From his father, of course.	You experimented on your own, son?

1 This whole deal's giving me a serious case of the butt-willies.	Look, kid, they obviously found your base of operations.  If it was a trap, why flip their dicks by announcing themselves?

1 What took you so long?	Don't even start, old man.

1 Guess you're not quite as invulnerable as you thought.	You're wrong -- a few minutes more, and my transition will be complete. Even your sword won't be able to affect me then.
2 You don't have a few minutes, Frost.

1 And you honestly expect me to believe all this?	I don't care what you believe. I saved your life once, I don't plan on making a habit of it. You want my advice, you'll be out of the city by nightfall. If you're stupid enough to stay, that's your business.
2 I can't just leave. I have a life here, a career --	Not anymore. You've seen one of them. You won't be allowed to live after that.

1 You let him go --  An hour ago you were ready to kill a man for less, this one didn't even talk.	He will.

1 Is he sick?	Cancer.

1 I can't -- I won't be able to stop --	Yes you will. The human side of you is stronger. I know it is.

1 Curtis, it's three in the morning. I'm really not in the mood for one of your practical jokes.	It's not a joke. I've got the stiff sitting in the morgue right now -- look, just come up and see him, okay? Five minutes, that's all I ask.
2 I thought you promised to give me some distance?	This is purely professional curiosity, Karen, I swear.

1 These archives are restricted to members of the House of Erebus.	Please. You and the other Elders wouldn't know what to do with these texts if your lives depended on it.  Which, of course, they do.
2 You're wasting your time, Frost. Far greater scholars than you have tried to decipher these words. Whatever secrets they hold have been lost.	Perhaps.

1 So what do you use, then? A stake?	Some of the old wives' tales are true -- they're severely allergic to silver, various types of wood. Feed them garlic and they'll go into anaphylactic shock --

1 I wouldn't go in there if I were you. It's best to leave him alone when he's like this.	I'll take my chances.

1 What, are you alright?	My eye, is there something in my eye?

1 No!	Mrs. Leavitt--
2 --I'm not staying here!	Let's talk to your husband--
3 --he's not my husband!

1 Oak?	No. What's it doing here in the middle of the foundation?

1 So says her website.	She <u>is</u>--she's helped solve a bunch of murders: Arizona, New Mexico--

1 Baby names?	I don't know. Nightmare.
2 You want me to scooch over next to you?	Yes.

1 I don't know what it is, but there is something <u>happening</u> here, and it's starting to scare the living shit out me, and look, I'm just <u>not</u> going to argue the point anymore--you want to stay here, stay, but I've got to get the fuck out of here, and I'm begging you to come <u>with</u> me.	I can't.
2 Then I'm going--	--no, you're not. You love me too much. You don't want to see them kill me.

1 Beer and weed is what I've got.	Both. Now.

1 There, what? I didn't see anything.	Back it up, rewind, whatever you call it.
2 Fine.

1 I take it back--she <u>wasn't</u> an actor. She's a nutjob.	That's what Josh and Mike said.
2 Shut-up.

1 What about night?	Not a great idea. Especially 'cross the street.

1 Same trees. They took Elly Kedward out to the same kind of trees.	--I look and look in the tree, all I ever see, he's always there watching, that stupid owl, over and over--
2 --Cotter, where can I get on-line?	--anywhere, anywhere, all up and live, all the time--fucking owl--

1 Nobody's going anywhere--	--hell, I don't think I'm ever leaving this place again--
2 --one of us, all of us--I have no idea--brought whatever this thing is back here. We're not going to go out there and spread it around like Typhoid Mary. We're gonna figure it out, we're gonna bring a goddamn <u>end</u> to it.

1 Cotter?	I'm not finished.
2 We're all going to be if you don't hit the brakes.

1 Cotter, I think she's right. Why would those guys go to all the trouble of stealing the camera and all this other stuff and leave the tapes?	Spite.
2 They were making a movie--if they were going to steal anything it'd be <u>just</u> the tapes, to see if we had anything they didn't.

1 How much of that stuff you guys been smoking?	Enough to keep sane.
2 Enough to make shapes and shadows in the dark into something else.

1 Look at those marks--just like in the movie.	Ancient runes--

1 What's that?	Hmm? I dunno. Chafing from the backpack, something.
2 That'd be up on your shoulder, maybe your lower back.	Then I have no idea.

1 Slow it down, slow it down, whatever it is, we'll figure it out.	That's why she kills children.
2 I know, I know--

1 We are being fucked with here, someone or something.	Domini.
2 Why in the world would <u>she</u>--	--why in the world would she just fly the coop in the first place?

1 Like a blueprint for disembowelment.	There are <u>other</u> explanations! She is not the goddamn witch, that's insane!
2 Then just give me one of your explanations that all three of us'll buy.	I don't....

1 ...Ray stole a shitload of money from Marty. Until both of 'em calm down I'm not getting involved.	No Meurice, it's worse than that. Something really happened, I think Marty's dead--
2 What?! Did Ray tell you that?	Sort of...

1 ...Well I'll be damned.	I couldn't believe it either...

1 ...You called me this morning.	Yeah.

1 ...Where is everything?	In the trunk.

1 It'll pass.	We don't seem to be communicating--
2 You want to hustle me. I don't want to be hustled. It's as simple as that. Now that I've communicated, why don't you leave?	I own the place.
3 Christ, I'm getting bored.	I'm not surprised, the company you've been keeping the last ten years.

1 What "what"?	Am I fired? You wanna hit me? What?
2 I don't particularly want to talk to you.	Well... if you're not gonna fire me I might as well quit.
3 Fine. Suit yourself.  ...Having a good time?

1 You want me to kill 'em.	I didn't say that.  Well?
2 Well what?	What do you think?
3 You're an idiot.

1 ...it's too damn risky.	Then you shouldn't have done it. Can't have it both ways.

1 Got a problem, Meurice?	No, you do, cowboy. You been to the bar?

1 I don't want to talk about it. Everything's okay now. I don't want to talk about it.	Sometimes it helps to talk things over. for instance, many marriages are saved by.
2 Aunt Barbara. I love you, but you're not gonna get it.

1 Detective Williams here. yeah. Tell him to go to Sergeant Milton. yeah, copy.  Well, Jeffrey, you found something which is very interesting to us. Very interesting. I know you must be curious to know more.  But. I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you not only not to tell anyone about your find, but also not to ask more about the case. One day. when it's all sewed up, I'll let you know all the details. Right now, though. I can't.	I understand. I'm just real curious like you said.
2 I was the same way when I was you age. I guess that's what got me into this business.	It must be great.
3 And it's horrible too.  I'm sorry Jeffrey. That's the way it has to be. Anyway. I'm sure you do understand.

1 Because of your information I alerted internal affairs to check out Detective Gordon.  I had to keep on with him as if nothing was different.  He slipped off on his own when he found out we were going to raid Frank's place.	Does Dorothy know her husband is dead?
2 Not yet.	Oh my God. Is her son OK?

1 That oughta do it.	Yeah.

1 Yes.	See my nipples?
2 Yes.	You can kiss them if you want. Fell them . They're getting hard.

1 Nice guy.  Who's he?	Who's it, you mean.

1 That wouldn't be too good, would it?	Frank would open you.
2 Okay. I know you've been scared. now you want to scare someone.	Does that scare you?
3 Shut up.	Beeeee careful.
4 Come on Dorothy.	What if Frank came over here and found us?

1 Where have you been?  Oh God. they hurt him, Jeffrey. Jeffrey, Jeffrey, Jeffrey, hold me. HOLD ME. Oh God.	It's okay. it's okay.
2 My secret lover.

1 Come on. I wancha to meet a frienda mine. Raymond, get enough beer for Ben too.	Okay Frank.
2 What kinda beer do you like?

1 I don't want to cause any trouble.	I'm here, aren't I?
2 I guess Mike's got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon.	Ooooo, you are smart. Just don't get too smart.

1 I'd like an ice-cold Heineken.	That sounds good.
2 Two.

1 Okay. be careful.	Okay, Sandy.

1 What was that all about?	Nothing. really! It's good to see you.
2 It's good to see you.	Where to?
3 Just go over to Gelford and up to Vista. It's not far. Can you tell me any more about what you learned?	I'd rather not talk about it. I'll tell you about it sometime.
4 It's okay.	... You look beautiful.
5 Thank you. Whatiya say we just enjoy the evening?	I like that idea. that's a real good idea.

1 Hi Dad.	Hey Jeff.

1 God. you scared me.	Is something wrong? What's happened to your face?
2 Nothing. I'm fine.	You can't just stay out half the night and carry on, Jeffrey. There's got to be some order, Jeffrey. I thought it would have been nice to call your father when you got home but now it is much too late.

1 Please excuse me a moment, Jeffrey, and I'll get to the dishes.	Sure thing. please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes?
2 Nice of you to offer, Jeffrey, but certainly not. just relax and enjoy your coffee. I'm sure Sandy will be back soon.

1 Pleased to meet you finally, George.  I am Augusto Oliveras.	My pleasure, Augusto.  Diego has told me much about you.

1 This is it for me.	What is?
2 Just everything.  You.  California.  The beach.  This spot right here.  I feel like I belong here, you know?  It just feels right.	You happy, baby?
3 Yeah.  I am.

1 Tuna, this is crap.	I know it's not the greatest.  It's commercial.
2 It's garbage.

1 What the fuck is that?	It's your grass.

1 It's nothing personal, George.  Just business.	Yeah.  I understand.  Just business. Right.  Fuck you.

1 That's over fifty-thousand dollars profit per kilo.	And that's wholesale.  Cut it a few times and retail, you're looking at two, three-hundred thousand.
2 Oh my G-d.	Yes.  And a kilo of coca is smaller than a kilo of your precious marijuana. Everything is the same, George, except instead of thousands, you are making millions.
3 Jesus Christ.  Jesus fucking Christ.	Now do you see what I am saying?
4 Getting it here is no problem.  Trust me.  I'll fly it in myself if I have to. What about supply?  How much can we get?	Don't worry.  We will talk of everything.  We have the time.  You arrive here with a Bachelor of Marijuana, but you will leave with a Doctorate of Cocaine.

1 Jesus Christ, George, I don't see you in two years, and you show up at my door with a hundred and ten pounds of cocaine?	Just sell it, Derek.

1 Jesus fucking Christ, Diego.  I ain't telling you.  It's just business.  Now, shut up.  You're driving me crazy.	I'm driving you crazy?  No.  You're driving me crazy.  We had a dream.  What happened to our dream?

1 Surprised to see me?	Take your boots off.  You're tan.
2 Mexico.	Yeah.  We heard all about it.  I want you to know I'm deeply sorry about your girlfriend.
3 Barbara.	Yes, Barbara.  She was very pretty.
4 Thank you.  Have you been getting the money I sent you?	You mean the drug money?  Yes, I got it.

1 I like to come up here.  To make the decisions.  To be one with nature.	It's beautiful.
2 People tell me that I am crazy.  That my business will never work in your country.  What do you think, George?

1 So, business is going good.  I've got this import/export thing going on in Miami that's been very profitable.  With my investments...	Don't bullshit me, George.  I don't see you very much, I don't want to waste the time.

1 What the fuck?  Is he going to walk?	He's going down, George.  It's election year.  We're not making any deals.

1 Source?  What about Derek?	He's getting middled, too.  And Derek's our partner.  What's good for us is good for him.

1 You should have taken better care of me, you know?  You've been away a long time. Four years.  Say something.	What do you want me to say?  I'm in prison.  You should know.  You put me here.
2 Fuck you, George.  I knew you'd say something like that.  Always thinking about yourself.

1 California?  You can go anywhere in the world.  India.  Tibet.  Australia. Paris.  And you choose California?	Yeah.
2 What is it?  A Disneyland thing?	No.  I just kind of like the sound of it.
3 California, huh?	California.

1 Ramon tells me you are looking for some mota.	Yes, I am.

1 Holy shit, Dulli!	Georgie, oh man, hold the mayo!
2 That was it.  Seeing Dulli after fourteen years sealed the deal for me. The rest was just details.  My end was roughly five-hundred thousand.  Kristina and I could have a good life for five hundred grand.  Start over somewhere. One final score.  That's all I needed.

1 But the NLF has always spoken of a strike as a demonstration ...	And you believe the NLF?
2 They seemed to be plausible this time. A general strike is a good argument for the UN.	The UN is far away, dear sir. It is easier to make oneself heard with bombs. If I were in their place, I would use bombs.

1 But I haven't shot him.	You weren't able to. But what's important is that you tried.
2 What's important for me is that you let me risk my life for nothing.	C'mon ... you're exaggerating. The orders were to shoot him in the back.
3 I don't do that kind of thing.	Then don't complain.
4 You still haven't told me why you didn't let me kill him.	Because we aren't ready yet for the French. Before attacking, we must have safe places from which to depart and find refuge. Of course, there is the Casbah. But even the Casbah isn't safe yet. There are too many drunks, pushers, whores, addicts, spies ... people who talk too much ... people who are ready to sell themselves, undecided people. We must either convince them or eliminate them. We must think of ourselves first. We must clean out the Casbah first. Only then will we be able to deal with the French. Do you understand, Ali?

1 What do you think of the strike, Ali?	I think it'll be a success ...
2 Yes, I think so too ... It's been organized well ... But what will the French do?

1 Why?	For many months, I've had your photo on my desk together with a dozen or so reports on you ... And naturally, I am under the illusion that I know you somewhat. You never seemed the type, Kader, inclined to performing useless actions.

1 I've been waiting for you to get back.	You got something on the coke?
2 No -- but I got something.

1 So she knew about his heart?	Had to.  I also interviewed three women who were in past relationships with Marsh.  There's no evidence that he had anything but straight sex prior to meeting Miss Lawson.
2 What about the will?	That's the best part.  She gets it all -- everything.

1 Mrs. Crawford, you were Mr. Marsh's maid for nine years?	Yes.
2 Did Miss Lawson and Mr. Marsh ever argue?	Like cats and dogs.
3 What did they argue about?	You name it -- they argued about it. Mr. Marsh tried his best to keep her happy -- but it seemed that no matter what he did it was never enough for her.
4 Did they argue the day before he died?	Well -- he died on a Sunday and I have the weekends off -- but they were ripping at each other with both barrels Friday afternoon.
5 What was the nature of the argument?	Sex.
6 Could you be more specific?

1 She's innocent.	Aren't they all?
2 Yeah.  Well -- we'll let the blindfolded lady with the scales decide that.

1 Objection!  May I remind Mr. Dulaney that the person on trial here is Miss Lawson -- not Dr. Paley.	Your Honor, I'm trying to establish a pattern in Dr. Paley's behavior with women.

1 Did Miss Lawson ever accompany Mr. Marsh to your office?	Yes.
2 Just one last question.  What does the sign on your office door say?	Doctor Steven Trammel.  Cardiologist.

1 Where did you meet Miss Lawson?	At a dinner party -- about eight months ago.
2 Did you ever see her again after that?	Yes -- several times.
3 What eventually happened to your relationship with Miss Lawson?	We stopped seeing each other.
4 Why?	Well -- I realized that she wasn't interested in me.  She was just trying to get information out of me.

1 I'm sure that every orgasm she had with me was faked.	That's enough.
2 I mean she only screwed me two or three times a night because she had to -- I'm sure she didn't enjoy it.

1 What did he say?	He laughed -- and basically said he would decide when it was over.
2 Do you remember his exact words?

1 Yes, I slept with him but that was a long time ago.	You're lying.  Marsh was wearing a cast on the tape.  It was right before he went to Chicago and met Miss Lawson.  He dumped you for her, didn't he?

1 What do you have in your purse?	What do you think I've got?  A gun? Maybe I'm gonna kill you too.  Maybe I'll blow your head off right now.

1 Frank!	I'll have you out in a few hours.

1 Why not?	Because, I'm your attorney.  I shouldn't be going to your house.
2 Is it against the law?	No -- it just doesn't look right.

1 You lied to me!	What?
2 I just left Joanne Braslow.  She told me she saw you doing cocaine at Marsh's house!	She's mistaken.
3 That's not good enough, Goddamit!	It isn't true.  You have to believe me.
4 No, I don't have to believe you.  The jury has to believe you and answers like he's lying or she's mistaken aren't going to convince them.	I don't use cocaine anymore.  If she says she saw me doing it she's lying.
5 Why would she lie?	I don't know, Frank -- but don't you think that's something we should find out?

1 What's that for?	To celebrate how masterfully you destroyed Roston today.
2 Rebecca -- we shattered a man's life in open court.	Fuck him!  He tried to shatter mine.
3 He was only doing what he thought was right.	You're too weak, Frank.  When you want something you have to do what- ever it takes to get it.  If something gets in your way you remove it.

1 I know -- but she wants you to represent her if Cardenas files.	Why?
2 Because I told her you were the best criminal attorney we have.	Raymond, I'm the only criminal attorney you have.
3 Well, I guess that makes you the best.  Look, Frank -- she stands to inherit three million dollars.  As executors of the estate and her attorneys that could generate a lot of legal fees for us.  All I'm asking you to do is talk to her.

1 The witness will answer the question.	Mr. Roston?

1 Frank -- I know you're busy, but Michael asked me after dinner if you were angry with him.  He wanted to know why you weren't talking to him.	I'll talk to him later.
2 Why don't you talk to him now?	Because I go to trial in seven weeks. I've got a lot of preparing to do.
3 No one's asking you not to work.  I just think you could make some time for your son.

1 Albert's got the stomach flu.	That's too bad.
2 No, it's not.  Now I get to pitch.	Michael, you shouldn't be happy when someone else isn't feeling well.
3 Not even if they're a dork?	Not even if they're a dork.  You should go by and see how he's feeling.

1 It's a beautiful picture of her.	Why are there two deeds here?

1 I thought everything WAS arranged.	Well, there's a problem.
2 What problem?

1 I had no idea it's gotten that bad, sis.	Oh, don't feel sorry for me. Please. No one's forcing me to stay.
2 Then why do you?	And do what? Live alone? Go back to school? Find someone else? Start a magazine for confused woman? ... What if I can't do any of those things?

1 Madge?	Hi. I made some brown betty. I sent Floyd off to town with the boy. I said -  "Floyd, I'm going to visit my girlfriend and spend the afternoon and that's all there is to it. He said who's going to make lunch? I said I'm taking a sick day. Eat at the dinner." Isn't that hilarious?  He didn't dare raise an eyebrow -- I don't even want to tell you how late he was out last night with those good for nothings from the Sandford ranch. I am so sorry, honey, I let two days pass before I came by, but with the boy home the time just escapes me. Have you heard from Richard? How's the fair? God, it's hot.

1 So, how long you've been living here?	Long.  You just got off the train and stayed without knowing anyone there?
2 Yeah.

1 Mind if I smoke?	Not at all.

1 You ought to write these stories down.	Nah. I've tried. My writing's too technical, I think. Problem of being a journalist too long is you stop giving yourself permission to invent. I better just stick to making pictures.
2 "Making pictures." I like that. You really love what you do, don't you?	I'm kind of obsessed by it, actually.
3 Why, do you think?	I don't know if obsessions have reasons. I think that's why they're obsessions.
4 You sound like an artist.	No. I wouldn't say that. National Geographic isn't exactly the hub of artistic inspiration. They like their wild life in focus and without any personal comment. I don't mind really. I'm not artist. I'd faced that a long time ago. It's the course of being well-adjusted. I'm too normal.
5 I don't think you're normal.

1 You really don't need anyone?	No, I think I need everyone! I love people. I want to meet them all! I just think there are too many out there saying "This is mine." or "She's mine." Too many lines have been drawn. World's breaking apart because of man's weakness for some testosterone conquests over territory and power and people. He wants control over what deep down he knows he has no control over whatsoever and it scares him silly.
2 Why doesn't it scare you?	I embrace Mystery. I don't know what's coming. And I don't mind.
3 Do you ever regret it? The divorce, I mean.	No.
4 Do you ever regret not having a family?	Not everybody's supposed to have a family.
5 But -- how can you just live for what you want? What about other people?	I told you, I love other people.
6 But no one in particular.	No. But I love them just the same.
7 But it's not the same.	That's not what you're saying. I know it's not the same. What you're saying is, it's not as good. Or it's not as normal or proper.
8 No, I'm just saying --	I'm a little sick of this American Family Ethic everyone seems to be hypnotized by in this country. I guess you think I'm just some poor displaced soul doomed to roam the earth without a self-cleaning oven and home movie.
9 Just because someone chooses to settle down and have a family doesn't necessarily mean they're hypnotized. Just because I've never seen a gazelle stampede doesn't mean I'm asleep in the world.	Do you want to leave your husband?

1 You want to eat something?	Are you hungry?
2 No.

1 I don't know why I'm so tired all of a sudden.	Long day. Go to sleep.
2 Am I too heavy for you?	No.

1 You feeling better Franny?	Yes. I'm fine. It's just this heat I think.

1 Uh... Yeah. Yeah. She's real nice.	Well, what's nice about her? Tell us!
2 Well, she's... she's real pretty and ... and she's got a cute shape... she's a good sport, ya know, for laughs and  ... she loves fried chicken wings and beer.	Isn't that nice? You should bring her home to meet us!

1 We can't go back there.  Are you crazy? You saw --	It's the only way.  It's possible your father may not be dead yet.

1 Ugh.  Muchos moscos, man.  This is too much.	Just some flies.
2 Some flies?  I think this qualifies as way more than "some."

1 Tia ain't a chick.  She's family.  And don't forget it.	Let's get going.  Go home, pick up what we need, then crash here.

1 Don't poison your mind with that ghetto paranoia.  That's all just ways of people justifying their own failure.	Dad, the man has been lying to us for a hundred years.  I mean, where is my forty acres and a mule?
2 You wouldn't know a mule if it bit you in the ass. And personally, I don't need a mule.  I got a Lexus.  And nobody gave it to me --

1 Gotta be an in-ey and gotta be smooth. If it's ragged, it was picked too soon. Won't ever be ripe.  Second, it's got to have just a little give, here.  At the edges.  And last, but not very far from least...  You gotta get your nose in it and give it a gooooood, looooong sniff.	I don't know whether to chill you and serve with cottage cheese, or rip you open and eat you right here.

1 What it will be.	How did you get in here?
2 Time like this, is that what you really want to know?  How I got the fuck in here?

1 We'll have to sneak in.	No we won't, Momma.  I'll just have them call and tell Patrick it's us.
2 Girl, they build gates like that to keep people like us out.

1 Why couldn't you just tell him to let us in?	My old man calls the shots.  He built that gate and these damn walls.

1 What are we doing down here?	Like you always said, Pop, look for the undervalued.

1 No way man...	You cut him, or I shoot you.  Make your choice.

1 And damp, too.  Let's not forget damp.	Whattaya think?  Can you picture it? Over there the bar, and in here -- the dance floor.

1 You look mighty familiar to me.  You sure you're not from around here?	I was born near here.  But after my mother died, my dad moved.  I grew up out in Rossmore Park.
2 You're pretty black to be growing up in Rossmore Park.

1 You shouldn't have hit me.	You want to get into this now?
2 No, no, Caesar.  Not now.

1 Caesar?  What is this?	Ask Johnnie!  Ask your rat-fuck son!

1 Not bad.  What for?	That's none of your goddamn business, Caesar.
2 You're right.  You don't have to tell me, if you don't want to.  I just hope you understand you're among good people here.

1 What?	I was getting out of the car when I saw him in the Mercedes.
2 It couldn't have been.	It was him.  I'm positive.
3 It's impossible!	Caesar, I know Johnnie.  It was him. I screamed when I saw him.  I couldn't believe I missed them.  I knew you were going to be upset so I thought I'd apologize and give Gino the Scotch.  I honked a couple of times but he didn't stop.

1 Tell them!  Tell them!	For Christ's sake, Johnnie, do what he says.

1 What did she do to you?	Everything you couldn't.

1 How's it going tonight, fellas?	Pretty good, sir.

1 I'm going to ask you where the money is.  Every time you don't give me an answer, I'm going to cut off one finger.	No.
2 When I reach ten, then I'll start with you.

1 Cease, can I ask you something?	Yeah.
2 Why'd you move all the furniture around?

1 No joke, ma'am.  Please open the door.	How do I know you are cops?

1 Do you know him?	No, but Caesar does.  He likes him. Says he's a good Italian.
2 Caesar is your husband?	Oh no, no.  I'm not the marrying kind.

1 Isn't it obvious?  I'm trying to seduce you.	Why?
2 Because I want to.  I've wanted to since I first saw you in the elevator.

1 Fuck it!  I think you better leave.	I think so, too.

1 The difference is, I can have sex with someone I just met, someone I hardly know, but to steal I need to know someone like I know myself.	Do you think you know me like that?
2 I think ...

1 What time did you say they would be there?	The plane is in at seven, so I'd say about eight.
2 Any bodyguards?	Gino travels with a big man named Roy.  Caesar calls him the driver.
3 Fine.

1 He'll have to run.	If he runs, everyone will assume he took the money.
2 You'll be clean and we'll be rich.

1 No, Johnnie.  No goddamned phones. Not now.	Pop?
2 Caesar, come here.  Sit.  We talk now.  You too, Johnnie.

1 They're putting together an agency oversight committee.  They're going to look through everyone's budgets. Treadstone is a rather sizable line item in my ledger.  What am I going to do about that?	You'd want to make that go away. You'd want to remind them that Treadstone is a training organization.  That it's all theoretical.  You'd want to sign off on that.
2 And what if I couldn't do that?	Then I'd have to explain Treadstone. And you'd have to explain how you let me get this far.  Doesn't sound like much of a Plan-B, does it?  We'll clean up the field.  You clean up your budgets.

1 Are you Treadstone?	Am I Treadstone?  Me?  What the hell're you talking about?

1 Mr. Kane...  Come right in...please...have a seat.	Thanks.

1 You could buy a car for twenty grand.  You could buy this car.	I don't want to go alone.  I want you to drive me to Paris.  Like we're a couple.  Like we're a couple and we're travelling together.  That's all we're doing.
2 And I don't get hurt.  I get twenty thousand dollars and I don't get hurt.	I won't hurt you.
3 What if I say no?	Then I'll find another ride.

1 So this is it, right?	I guess.

1 He's dead isn't he?	Marie -- look at me -- there's no time for this --
2 He went out the window -- why? -- why would someone do that?	-- we can't stay here -- I can't stay here -- it's not safe here --
3 He came to kill us.	-- we can go -- I can get us out of here -- but we have to go now --
4 You knew he was coming.	No.
5 I trusted you.	You're wrong.  I didn't know.
6 I don't trust anybody and I trusted you!	I didn't know this would happen.
7 He had my picture!  He knew I was here!  He came here to kill us!	And where is he now?  You believe what you want, but I'm telling you the truth -- I never would have brought you here if I thought it was dangerous.
8 Oh, Jesus...	You stay -- if you want, you stay -- it's okay -- it's better -- maybe it's better -- I don't know --  But I can't stay here.  <u>I can't</u>.
9 But the police --	-- there's no time --
10 -- we'll explain it --	-- how? --
11 -- there's two of us -- we'll tell them -- we'll just --	-- forget it --
12 -- we'll tell them what happened --	I don't know what happened!  I don't know who he is!  I don't know what he wants!  I don't even know who I am!  The only thing I know is that if I stay here, I'm never gonna find out!

1 xxxxxx	xxxxxx

1 Where's the dog?	My husband's out looking for him.
2 He run away often?	That old beast?  Miss his breakfast? Not a chance.  It's always something, right?

1 What?	Zurich police are looking for an American with a red bag.  Apparently he put two cops in the hospital last night.

1 ...ervices.	Uh - what? - I ...

1 Oh yeh? Where'd you get this from eh  out yer nostril?	...Yer nostril?
2 Central Services don't take kindly to sabotage!	...sabotage!

1 Mr. HELPMANN, what would you say to those critics who maintain that the Ministry Of Information has become too large and unwieldy ...?	David ... in a free society information is the name of the game. You can't win the game if you're a man short.

1 Help me!	I assure you, Sam, I'm doing everything within my power. But the rules of the game are laid down, and we all have to play by them - even me.
2 This is all a mistake! Don't you understand?!	Yes, well, from the Department's point of view you're certainly a bit of an own goal, but ...
3 I'm not a terrorist! You must know that! I'm not guilty! Get me out of here!	Sam, if you've been going out there and playing a straight bat, all the way down the line, you've got absolutely nothing to worry about.
4 Please, I've got to find Jill.	Sam, I think I ought to tell you ... I'm afraid she's upped stumps and retired to the pavilion.

1 What's she done?	You didn't know as much about this business as you pretended to, did you?
2 Er ... no.	Very smart.
3 Er ... but I would've found out anyway.	Yes. I'm impressed.
4 Tell me about Layton.	She witnessed the Tuttle arrest - the Buttle arrest - and since then she's been making wild allegations, obviously trying to exploit the situation - she's working for somebody, and she's not working for us.
5 A terrorist?

1 You're a stupid, fat arsed, obstructive, fascist moron aren't you?	If you say so.
2 You think these are tits don't you?	Ah.
3 I bet you'd like to touch them?	Oh.
4 Well don't. You're looking at twenty pounds of high explosive! And if you don't stamp this form I'm going to blow the place up!

1 What's going on here?	What does it look like ... I'm collecting empties.

1 Jill! What are you do ... I mean ... how did you ... Are you alright?	Yes.
2 What happened to you after ...	Your face ... are you hurt?
3 No. No. I'm fine. I was worried sick about you ... I thought ...

1 There we go. Mrs. Veronica Buttle. What's the number on the cheque?	27156789/074328/K.

1 Alright. There's someone I want to check out. A woman called Gillian Layton.	A woman eh? I see.
2 I know her age and distinguishing marks. But I need an address or a place of work or something	This is your dream girl, is it?
3 What?  Look, let me use the console for a few minutes.	You must be joking -  When there's a woman involved - there's no stopping me. Now, let me have that sheet.

1 I hope you like it. It's very exclusive.	What is it?
2 It's something for executives.

1 Really, Sam - when are you going to do something about these terrorists?	What? Now? It's my lunch hour.

1 My name is Sam Lowry. I have to report to Mr Warren.	Thirtieth floor, sir. You're expected.
2 Er, don't you want to search me?	No, sir.
3 My I.D. cards.	No need, sir
4 But I could be anybody.	No you couldn't, sir. This is Information Retrieval.  the lift's arrived, sir.

1 What the - ? How did you - ?	Emergency procedures.

1 Are you expecting anyone?	No. Wait here.

1 It's okay, Kanita. Come on in.	He looks like a cop.
2 He's not a cop, he's a medic.  I'm CY Coates.

1 They're gonna torch the fence. You're gonna feel the metal getting warm, maybe very warm.	I can't hold up my head anymore.

1 You're not going to die.	What did you say?
2 Shut up. You're going to die and he's not. Got it.

1 You shouldn't smoke.	It's okay. They're prescription.  Works better with a little whiskey.
2 That's my brother's problem. He's passed out inside.

1 Excuse me. You seemed like you were in trouble.	I'm all right. I just can't stand to see people tied up.  I'm in the waiting room for hours, listening to Noel screaming. The only reason he's screaming is 'cause he's tied up.
2 Don't seem so bad to me.	Don't say that. I wanted to cut my father loose too. They told me he almost died and five minutes later they say he's better and I go in. It's killing me seeing him fighting like that.  Look, since you're here, maybe you could do me a favor. I need you to wait for me outside this building, okay? I have to visit a friend who's sick.
3 Okay.

1 She only works when I'm on. I make her wait and it drives her crazy.	Is it true that you and Love went on a blind date?  She hit you with a bottle?
2 She loves me the way no woman ever has.

1 Don't give me that look.	What look?
2 You know what I'm talking about. It's all over your face. That I-just- saved-a-little-baby-boy look.	We just saved a little baby boy. Think of it that way.
3 I don't want to hear about it, okay? That's three jobs for the night. It's over. Three jobs and time for a drink. Six am, the cocktail hour. Pass the bottle; I know you're holding.

1 He's dead, Rose. Your father passed.	How can that be? He was getting better.
2 He coded. They shocked him one too many times. I'm sorry.	He was tough. You did all you could.
3 I'm sorry.	You have to keep the body going until the brain and heart recover enough to go on their own.

1 Whadda we bring?	Better bring it all.

1 Oh no!--I just remembered.	What?
2 I'm so stupid. I had beef lo mein last night. I can't eat the same thing two nights in a row. It's almost two o'clock, what the hell am I gonna do? What you getting?	I'm not hungry.
3 Oh yeah, you don't eat food.	I eat. I just haven't had coffee yet.
4 Coffee and whiskey, lucky you ain't dead with that diet. Wait, I've got it. Half fried chicken with fries. Let's go, hurry up. Come on.

1 He's crazy.	You really think so?

1 One source referred to it as a five billion dollar metal sculpture to ugly to look at and too big to bury.	You write this?

1 You're feeling good, aren't you?	I'm starting to... We may do the capitols of the states.
2 Fifty, right?

1 You packing up tonight?	Yes.  And I'm sorry that they're sending you down for a while, but you'll make it back...Where they sending you?
2 London.	London.  That's a promotion!
3 I don't think so.	It is.  Yes -- that's where they had Rorish, for God's sake, before they made him anchor.  I can't stand it -- they're grooming you for it all and you don't even know it.
4 Hold it down, okay?	Can I ask you something?  You only had one crew on the date rape piece, right?

1 Hi.  Turn on your TV... <u>Good Morning America</u>, the <u>Morning News</u> and <u>Today</u> are all about to talk to Arnold Schwarzenegger and I think he's live on at least two of them.	At six o'clock on the wake-up news they used the wrong missile graphic.
2 Now listen, Arnold just said that he's been making three million a movie now.  But he's not ever gonna change.  He's still the same person when he was making two million dollars a movie.  He feels no different.  He also bought a brand- new condo with Maria, they gonna furnish tastefully.	A half hour in the lobby.
3 Okay, I'll see you in the lobbies [<i>sic</i>].

1 I think the pilot that shot down the Libyan in 1981 is stationed right here.  Maybe you could get him -- and maybe Tom should say that our F-14 is one of the hardest planes to fly. They're nicknamed 'Tomcats'.	Thanks.  The F-14 is one of the most difficult planes to master.  Oh, you call them 'Tomcats' and in the 70's the first crop had a number of crashes.

1 How'd it go?	You didn't see it or speak to anybody?
2 No.	Then it went well.
3 Did it really go well?	Define your terms.
4 Do you feel good about it?	No.
5 Do others feel that you did well?	No.
6 Then what was good about it?	I lost six pounds...
7 Aaron, will you tell me?	It was great...writing my little first rate copy, sitting on my jacket, punching my one thought. But I had this historic attack of flop sweat so they'll never let me another again.  Oh, I lost one of your shoulder pads -- how was your evening anyway?
8 What do you mean, flop sweat? -- you're making too much out of it...I'll bet you were the only one aware of it...	People phoned in.
9 Stop kidding.  I want to know what happened.	I'm not kidding.
10 There were complaining phone calls because you were sweating?	No, nice ones worried that I was having a heart attack.
11 If all that happened, how come you're so chipper?	I don't know.  At a certain point it was so off the chart bad -- it got funny.  My central nervous system was telling me something. Jane -- sweat running down my face -- makeup falling into my eyes -- people turning this fusillade of blow dryers on me -- all so I could read introductions to other people who were covering stories which is what I like to do anyway.  And I'm chipper because you finally showed up.  I thought I'd cook for us. Tequila and eggs sound good?
12 I have to be somewhere.

1 Why not try it for a few weeks?	Stop.  Ernie thought I was good too -- he couldn't help.  My agent has a hot prospect -- the number two station in Portland.  The general manager says he wants to be every bit as good as the networks.  Personally, I think he should aim higher.
2 Tell me the God's honest truth -- are you leaving because of me? Because if you are...	Ernie told this story.  How he used to write obits and when the people in town called him up with death notices, he cried.  He was till that way when they promoted him out of obits.  He says you're lucky if you can get out while you could still cry.  I should have quit this place  three years ago.
3 You're just trying to say all great stuff so I'll feel even worse that you're not around.

1 I had the strangest thing happen yesterday.  Anne and I have been married what? -- Thirty-six years... Everything fine -- two days after the promotion came through, I was checking myself in the mirror and she was making a face at me behind my back. So yesterday I looked in the mirror and she was doing it again.	You didn't say anything to her?

1 We came from Washington.	Move away from me.
2 How long has it been since you've been home.	Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuckes.  Snot... Fuckee.  You want to use that?
3 It depends on how big a news day it is.

1 Aaron should be hearing this so I have an extra witness.	Well, you always want to give the credit away, do you?
2 No, I don't.  He happens to deserve the credit.  He's right here.	I'll speak to you soon

1 Go back to 316, Bobbie.  The sound bite in the cab -- it starts, 'I don't know how I'll feel...'	We could...
2 Please, Bobbie, we're pushing.

1 Hey, Buddy, don't do that anymore.	Okay.

1 You know, Tom, I feel a little proud when people comment on your looks.  Maybe you should feel that way.	Proud?  I'm just embarrassed that I like when they say those things.
2 As long as that's your only problem you're...	It's not.

1 Another thing I can't stand is ...when White House reporters bullshit with each other after a briefing and then one of them has a theory and the other quotes it in his story as "White House" sources say...	That actually goes on...
2 Yes.  My room is down here -- I'm not tired.  Do you want to keep talking?	Yes, sure.

1 I can't help you, sorry.  I'm not here to teach remedial reporting.	And it has nothing to do with the fact I left your room instead of staying there?

1 You have to celebrate with me, don't you?  Everybody's going to that bar on the corner, 'Caps.'	I'm going over to Aaron's.  Maybe I'll hoop up with all of you later.  How long do you think you'll be there?

1 It's incredible who's here.	Who?
2 Me!

1 Hi.  It's me.	Where are you?
2 I can't get away just yet.  I'm at Aaron's.	Well, when?
3 I'm not sure.  It seems like he had sort of a mishap on the news.	I know.  I taped it.
4 It wasn't as bad as he think, was it? -- it wasn't unprecedented or anything?	Not if you count 'Singing in the Rain.'  Do him a favor and don't treat it like a tragedy.  You want me to talk to him?

1 I don't wan to discuss work.	Well, let's do a special report on that...I mean that's news.
2 I knew what you meant.	What I don't know, I can learn and what I know, nobody can teach. Excuse me for saying it about myself, but I think it's true.  What do you think?  Never mind what you think.

1 Where's the bathroom?	Through the closet.

1 Well I'm touched.  You're serious, aren't you?	Yes.  Fifty dollars an hour, right?
2 Yeah.

1 Alright we're clear.	Anything new?
2 Not really.  One girl who fit the descrip came in, kinda skinny, brunette, didn't see much changing hands.	Is the manager cooperating?
3 Yeah, he's keeping an eye out, said he'd call us if he sees anything. That's about it for tonight.	Alright I got you, man.  It's my turn for freak patrol.
4 You know it.  I'm out of here.

1 How did you ever find it all in yourself, Walter?	It wasn't easy.

1 Did you hear what he said?	Yes Walter.
2 All about me...

1 Uh...  ...how long have you been thinking about this, Walter?	Oh...f-for a long time.  Ever since you first came to the club.

1 Walter...I can't believe it.	I'm honored to know this man.

1 What's the matter with you?	Nothing...nothing at all.
2 I've never seen anyone so... squeamish.  Well, what's your opinion, Leonard?	Don't ask.
3 Oh come on!  Even you can see its value.

1 I wonder what his deal is.	I think he's looking for you, man... it's all finally catching up with you!

1 Well I brought something, I wanted to show you.	What is it, your laundry?
2 Huh?

1 No, it's Ok...you came in early.  Besides, you're creating an incident. When people are applauding they don't order anything.	Well...
2 Look, go home and...work on something. Make another cat.	I don't have another cat!
3 Well make a dog, make a parakeet! I'm sure you'll think of something.	A parakeet?

1 A show..how soon can we go?	These things take time Walter... but for now you've got to break out of this one...avenue you're on...

1 How ya doin'?	Uh, hi.

1 What are ya, deaf?  Turn around!	NO! NO DON'T SHOOT ME I DON'T WANT TO GET SHOT!
2 Relax!

1 An' everyone will say Walter let me shake your hand...it's a real pleasure to have known you...	Here here!

1 I want you to have it.  There's a little something for you in here...	Gee.  Thanks.
2 Let it inspire you.  Maybe it will let you think of me.

1 I don't think this is gold.	Not as single-minded as the others, not as sybaritic.  Almost thoughtful. She's useless.

1 Man has a complex.	He's got a...  What do you call it? A Napoleonic Code.

1 Hey!  She wasted my dog!	Bummer metaphor.

1 Oh, my God.  Is that true?	Probably.  What movie is this?

1 What show is this?	It's the news, Buffy.
2 Oh.  Who's in it?  I know what it is.  It's what's on instead of the movie.	I just want to see the basketball scores.  It's important.
3 Mmmnkay.

1 I don't understand.	Oh, come on, Buffy.  You know what's going on.  It's not working out at all.  I've got to move on.  I mean, I've got needs, too.  I told you about all this.
2 No, you didn't.  When?	Didn't you get my message?
3 You broke up with my machine?	You weren't home.  Like always.
4 You left me a message?	I'm out of here.  Jenny.

1 Do you do this kind of thing a lot? I mean, is this like a hobby?	Not exactly.
2 They were vampires, weren't they?	Yeah.
3 God!  Unbelievable.  Vampires.

1 I'm going to the dance.	What for?
2 In order to dance and to drink punch and to be with my friends. Comprende?	I don't believe this.  The world's under attack by the legions of the undead and you're going to a mixer?
3 It's not a mixer.  It's the senior dance.  And it's important.  You wouldn't understand.	You got that right.  I thought you wanted to kill vampires.
4 I don't want to kill anybody, and I don't want to talk about it anymore.	Listen, I know you're bummed about your friend, and I'm really sorry...
5 He did what he was supposed to.	But, Buffy, you're the guy, the chosen guy.
6 Right.  I'm the chosen one.  And I choose to be shopping.	I should have known.

1 Bugs.	Okay, guys, how about the ozone layer?

1 I didn't learn... I just... it's not a big deal.	Buffy, I'm gonna tell Jeffrey you were playing with another man's Hebrew National.
2 Get a boob job.

1 I was a slave.	In Virginia.
2 I don't know.  It was...  There was a big gram or something.  And there's one, I'm like a prostitute...	China.
3 Oh, my God.  I never told anybody about this.  I remember the one about the peasant, too.  God, there's a bunch.  Is this, like channeling or something.

1 It's not pretty, but it does suit our purposes.	Our purposes.

1 What!?!	Try to pay attention.

1 None of the other girls ever gave me this much trouble.	And where are they now?

1 You guys blow.  I'm waiting on Cassandra.  She's gonna help me with my history.	Cassandra's really smart.
2 Yeah... She's okay, though.	I guess.

1 No, wait.  I can be dumb.  Really. Or mean, or whatever.  I can learn. I'm useful.	Really?
2 Swear to God.

1 She didn't even hardly talk to anyone in school.  All year.  She didn't even go to the prom.	I heard she got straight A's.

1 Cool!	Does Jeffrey know?

1 Buffy, the ape-woman.	Seriously, Buffy.  That look was way twisted.  What were you thinking about?

1 Yeah maybe you're right.	You see how nice things are when we go slow?

1 I can't keep up with you.  First you say sex is gonna make me a better pitcher--now no sex is gonna do it?!	It's all the same thing.

1 Nuke!  You got things all wrong! There's no relation between sex and baseball.  Ask Crash.	I did.
2 What'd he say?	He said if I gave in to you I'd start losing again.
3 He did?	I'll be back when we lose.

1 Well let's get down to it, honey-- how was he?	Well, he fucks like he pitches. Sorta all over the place

1 See my hips?	Yep.
2 I think Thomas Pynchon's a genius.	When you're hitting you shouldn't think about anything but hitting.  But you shouldn't think about it too much.  The trick is to use your brain to not use your brain.
3 But you were pulling your hips last night.	So...Wanta make love?

1 God damn you--what is happening? Is there no man who'll have me?  This is the weirdest season I ever saw--the Durham Bulls can't lose and I can't get laid!	You okay?

1 Ninety-five miles an hour.	He looks great, just great!

1 Thanks for the note--you're right, I wasn't bending my back.	You got a live arm there.

1 No, that is not belief.  That is desperation.	C'mon, God damn it, gimme some!

1 How come you don't like me?	'Cause you don't respect yourself, which is your problem, but you don't respect the game--and that's my problem.  You got a gift.
2 What do I got?	A gift.  When you were a baby the gods reached down and turned your left arm into a thunderbolt.

1 Hey, I'm cruisin', man--what're you doing out here?!	I want you to throw this one at the bat rack.
2 Why?!  I'm finally throwin' the damn thing where I want to.	It'll keep the fear of God in the hitters.  Trust me.
3 You're the boss.

1 I'm trying to thank you.	Let go of me!

1 Crash Davis?	The Crash Davis. ) And you, Larry Hockett, should recognize me 'cause five years ago in the Texas League when you were pitching for El Paso and I was hitting cleanup for Shreveport, you hung a curve on an 0-2 pitch of a 3-2 game in bottom of the 8th and I tattooed it over the Goodyear Tire sign, beat you 4-3-- and I got a free wheel alignment from Goodyear.

1 I gotta go now, Dad.	I was thinking I could fly up and spend a week in the Big Leagues with you--help you get comfortable.
2 No.  If I screw up, I wanta do it alone.  I'll call.	We'll be praying for you.
3 Dad--if my curveball is hanging, God ain't gonna help me.	We'll pray anyway.
4 If it makes you and mom feel better, go for it.  I gotta run--

1 Eight and twenty-four.	Eight and twenty-four!  How'd we ever win 8 games?
2 It's a miracle.	Look, guys--I'm a man, I got needs too.  I understand this party-- but...  sex is the one thing you can get further behind in and catch up faster than anything I know.  There's a baseball lesson in there somewhere.  Where's Crash?

1 I mean, the guy is history as far as I'm concerned. History.	But you can't just fire him. Webb's his brother-in-law. He's County Commissioner.
2 So what? Everybody out here with cowboy boots is a fuckin' county commissioner or related to a county commissioner. I'm fuckin' sick of it.	This is his state. His uncle's Chief Judge. His brother-in-law runs the County Commission. I don't know how many other relatives he's got in town.  There's gotta be a way to work him back in.
3 Phil, I can understand. You're in the finances, you're upstairs, but you are not on the floor. I got thousands of players. I got five hundred dealers.  They're all lookin' to rob me blind, twenty-four hours a day. I have to let them know I'm watching all the details, all the time; that there is not one single thing I will not catch as I am over here.

1 As far as the world was concerned Andy Stone, the head of the Teamsters' Pension Fund, was a legitimate guy.	This is a very auspicious occasion.
2 A powerful man.	Philip, if you would rise.

1 Okay, Randy. Thank you.	All right, take care.

1 Now this is just a signature card.	So, once she signs those papers, she'll be the only person to have total access to the box?  No one else, including myself?
2 That's right.

1 ...give him a shot at runnin' a casino and he tries to talk you out of it.	You know, I don't know if I could do this even if I wanted to. The Gaming Commission would never give me a license. I have at least two dozen gambling and bookmaking pinches on me.

1 Holy shit, what've you been doin' out here?	Honey, come here.

1 No, I didn't know that. But you know what he did?	No.

1 - no matter where he was or what he was doing, he always went home to make breakfast for his son, Nicky- Boy.	Here, let's put a little of this on for you. I know you like this. A little butter, right, not a lot?

1 Yeah.	Meet me at three.
2 What - what, Caesar's?	No, a...
3 ...hundred yards further down the road.	Why?
4 Don't ask questions. Just be there.

1 Hey, it is my pleasure.	Yeah, I heard a lot about you.
2 Oh, thank you, sir.

1 You know, I don't feel like playin' tennis.	...as soon as Andy got back home, Nicky heard about our talk in the car.
2 Let's go to lunch. Do you want to go to the Riviera?	Next morning bright and early, I get the call.

1 This woman's an institution.	I don't care what she is. She's an institution, that's the problem. She's lazy.

1 She took care of the dealers...	Hey, Mitch.
2 ...pit bosses, floor managers.	Thank you.
3 But mostly...

1 Crooked cops and kidnappers, they don't take checks.	Need a little help with that, Mr Collins?
2 So, I put two million in cash in a Los Angeles bank under the name of Mr and Mrs Tom Collins. This was strictly my shakedown and kidnapping money.

1 It's okay.  Look...  ...you gotta get a hold of yourself.	Okay.
2 If not for me, at least for Amy.	Okay, okay.
3 You understand? Your drinking's gettin' way out of hand. I'm gonna get you into a program. They got plenty of good ones.	I don't need one.
4 Yes, you do. It's very discreet. There's no names in the papers. You don't have to worry about any of that stuff.	That's all you care about.  You don't care about me at all.
5 Yes, I - yes, I do.	No, you don't.
6 How could you say that?  You're a beautiful woman. You're destroying yourself. You don't need that stuff. You don't need that fuckin' leech livin' off you. I know you better than you know yourself. You're a tiger, you're stronger than I am. And when you set your mind on doing something, you do it better than anybody.  You can do it.  You can do it.	Oh, God. Oh, God. Okay.  Okay... I'll try. I'll try.

1 Get off of me! Stop it!	Come with me now! Come with me now. Come with me now. I want you out of here.

1 Oscar wants you to call him.	So, who'd you go to lunch with?
2 With Jennifer.	And where'd you go?
3 To the Riviera.	What'd you have?
4 I had a... salad.	What did Jennifer have?
5 She had the same.	Okay. I want you to call Jennifer and I want you to tell her to tell you what she had for lunch, and I'm gonna listen in on the other line.
6 Why do you want to do that?	You know why I want to do it. Just do it.
7 Fine.  Just gonna get the bowl for my thing.	Mm.

1 I won't let her in. I'm sorry, Randy, I'm not gonna let her in. She - Well, I'm not gonna let her in, the way she's behaving. I'm - I'm -	Not gonna let me in?
2 Who knows what you're gonna do in there? I don't want you -	What do you mean, what am I gonna do? I'm in the same clothes for two days! I want to get a few of my things! Big deal!

1 It won't happen again, Sam.	Mr Rothstein.

1 Excuse me.	What?
2 Is this yours? Your pen?	Yeah, that's my pen. Why?
3 I ju- Well, it's a nice pen. I just didn't know whose it was. I thought it was yours. I didn't want it to get lost.	Well, thank you. Why don't you take that fuckin' pen and shove it up you ass, you fuckin' jag-off?

1 Yeah, that works out.	But how much cash could I bury in my closet, right?
2 You need to understand, and I - I'm sure you do... that in a venture of this kind, you have to be prepared to take some kind of loss.	Oh, listen, I understand that there's always a risk... you know, I might have to take a loss somewhere.
3 So I put some of the money into legitimate deals with Charlie Clark. He was Ace's banker.	I mean, you will try to push it through, won't you, Mr Clark?
4 Yes.	Well, you gotta understand, I'm giving you fifty thousand cash.

1 What do you want? It - It's pitch- black out here. It's tin foil.	Pitch-black?! It -
2 It looked like a fuckin' gun!	You - You fuckin' moron, I'll be filling out paper work for the next two months because of you and this piece of shit, you...
3 Oh my God, what are we gonna do? I'm sorry.	...fuckin' jerk-off.

1 You took your boots off? You put your feet on the table... you shit- kicking, stinky, horse-manure-smellin' motherfucker you!  You fuck me up over there, I'll stick you in a hole in the fuckin' desert! You understand?  Go over there and apologize.  Go! Get the fuck out of -	Nicky, I'm sorry.

1 Yeah, I'm over here with him.	Oh.

1 But back then the bosses didn't give a fuck about whether he enjoyed himself of not. To them, he was a cash register. All they had to do was ring the bell and take the money. Especially Remo, who was a fuckin' degenerate gambler who always lost.	Ma che cazzo!

1 He didn't have to hit him. It's not exactly like I'm sleepin' with the guy! And he makes me sneak around to see my own friends! What the fuck is that all about?	Well, I guess it's 'cause he loves you so much. He's jealous and worried.
2 He gives a fuck what I do?	Look, I'll try to find out what the hell's goin' on. When I see him I'll talk to him.
3 Okay.	All right?
4 Yeah.  Thanks.

1 He hates my fuckin' guts.	Come on, come on, you're a toughie. You can take this.  Don't cry.
2 I'm not as tough as you think I am.	Yes, you are.
3 I'm not and he scares the shit out of me. I never know what he's gonna do.	Come on. Don't be scared.
4 I need some help. I do. I need some help.  You gotta help me. I need a new sponsor, Nicky.

1 I'm sorry.	Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.  Thank you very much. Thank you very much.

1 - with stupid braces on your teeth.	Okay, then.
2 Every time I ever see you, that's what I see.	Uh, talk to you later.  Bye. 

1 Hey, how you doin'? 	Hey. Hey, Sammy, how are you?

1 Whenever we got local merch, we'd usually send it to Palm Spring or Arizona... LA. I had a couple of sand niggers out there. You know, Arabs.	What, are you gonna have a fuckin' meeting here, or are you gonna buy some diamonds?

1 I do all the work. Somebody don't like it, fuck him.	It's up to you.
2 They want a fuckin' war, I'm ready.

1 I fucked up, Frankie. I fucked up good this time. Should have never started with this fuckin' broad.	Take it easy. What could you do? I mean, she threw herself at you, right?
2 I'm in a bad fuckin' spot here. You know that? Bad fuckin' spot.

1 Hey! Oh!	Oh, sorry -
2 What's the matter with you?	Receipts and bills and... everything's here.
3 Since when do you talk like that?	I'm sorry.
4 There's a lot of people here.	Nance gives me trouble and I'll tell him... screw around with those suitcases and I'll take the eyes out of his frickin' head.
5 Again!	I didn't curse. I said 'frickin' head'.
6 That's enough.	I'm sorry.

1 Oh Man, not the sewer, I just had this cape cleaned...	It's okay. Let her go.

1 Strange--you seemed so close. I wonder what's happened since yesterday..	I wonder..

1 Hmm. Not bad.	You're telling the truth. I can tell..How did this..

1 Selina, are you okay?	Yes, did you call us here for any particular reason?

1 Oh Honey, it's so much better when we do it without the helmet.	I've been thinking. I've been thinking about us. I'm sorry I've been so hard no you these past couple days. I realize now it's because you're the only woman who ever understood me and I couldn't handle it!  I've never revealed myself to anyone the way I have to you. Let's blow this town together.  We'll run a bed-and-breakfast in Vermont by day, and by night, we'll dress up and kill anything that...
2 Pass!	You were right all along--the two parts to a person are the reality and the lie.  I was making good money as a top architect--but that's not who I am. I'm not an architect, I'm a..
3 I know, I know, a Warrior. You're very annoying..Now tell me how to defuse the bomb you've set..

1 Boss-man, what were you going on about last night: "I am the Law and I am the Danish..."	I don't know what I was saying. I totally phoned it in last night. I haven't been getting a lot of sleep lately...

1 Well, you don't see that everyday. Somebody tell me what's the deal with Frida Kahlo here?	Just a homeless woman. Wrong place.

1 Ah, the good guys always triumph in the end. It's what allows our children to sleep at night.	You can't get away with..

1 You know, Kyle, you're still pretty hot for a pre-Bicentennial babe...	"Pre-bicentennial babe?"
2 Yeah, as in born before..Ooh, I suppose it's "sexual harassment" to give a woman a compliment. Sheesh. Come on, gentleman...

1 Did you try to kill...	What?
2 Nothing. How's your hand?	About the same. Thanks for asking...Damn blender.  Okay, I can't stand it anymore, I'm dying to know--Did you try on some whiskers last night and hit a 7-11 along with all those other women? You had to have thought about it--a Catwoman for a night?
3 Like you don't know...	I'm having a hard time picking up your signal this morning--What did you say?
4 I said I saw you last night. What were you doing hiding in that alley, running off when the superhero alarm sounded...	I was doing my job. At the risk of sounding egotistical, I didn't become the best reporter in the world sitting by the phone. I was chasing tail all night--I was not spying, intentionally, on your hot and heavy date with "Brock Leviathan, architect."  I can't believe he ordered white wine.  You do know white wine is not real wine...
5 Hey, I thought...

1 A hearty breakfast is the start of a great morning...	Oh, I forgot to tell you, you're on a diet...The fact you're still reasonably pretty is the one thing you got going for you.
2 Oh Mommy, you're embarrassing me.	Is every single thing out of your mouth since your "accident" have to be a monotone mumble of cheap sarcasm?
3 Maybe.	It's funny, I've heard of giving up finding a man and raising a family to pursue a career. And I've heard of foregoing a career to start a family-- but I think you're onto something new, Selina. "Absolutely nothing"-- Has a ring to it. I think it could catch on...How's that for sarcasm?
4 Pretty good...Mom, I don't want you to think I don't appreciate...letting me stay, getting me the job--I've been a mess. I'm still a mess. It's just...we have to start having a different conversation. I can't take..

1 Nice breasts.	Thanks.

1 Say something ...	Me, he won't stay on the phone with for five fucking minutes without bitching.
2 I'm trying to help somebody. Okay?	He's at it again.  Like that night at the Emerald.  This piece of Euro-trash is slapping shit out of his little wife in a back booth -- so Mr. Good Deed here has got to step in and pound the fucker's head into the wall.  Meantime "Wifey" recovers enough to pull off her high heel and nearly take our hero's eye out.  It took six stitches.
3 How was I in the wrong?

1 Lady, don't let him do it!	You got it wrong.  I'm the one that's on your side.
2 You almost brain me and lock me in a fucking trunk and you're on my side?  You stupid fuck!

1 I prefer to have the sucker die at a more convenient location.  Once Nels arrives with his backpack full of goodies.	So Theo and Nels will appear to have whacked each other out and we never existed.  A thing of beauty. Jesus, the shit you come up with!

1 I thought you said you could handle him.	I'm doing fine.  Theo wants to deal.

1 No don't.  You could lose me for good.  Don't go through that tunnel.	I'm in traffic.  There's no place to turn.
2 Please.	Shit!

1 Where's the fucking recharger cord?  Must be in her car, dammit.	How much time do you have left on it?
2 I don't know.  80 or 90 minutes, tops.	Why didn't you do what your friends wanted and just -- get rid of me?
3 I don't know.  I hung up on somebody else a long time ago, and later on I wished I hadn't of.	A woman?
4 Hey drop it, okay?	I didn't mean to open up any old wounds.
5 It never healed.  I called her a lying bitch and everything else and I hung up on her.  "Click." You don't exist.	And that was the end of it?
6 I sure as hell got my wish.  She doesn't exist.  So maybe you reached the appropriate person after all.	I'm sorry if I caused you to lose your business deal.
7 Well you did.

1 You said they wanted to get into some particular safety deposit box?	The one in Brentwood.
2 What bank?	The City National on San Vincente.

1 It's locked.	Shit.  I'm sorry.

1 Now you're starting to sound like a victim again.	You could've hit me.
2 Only in the leg or the thigh. You'd live but you just wouldn't wear shorts.	You wouldn't --
3 Yes I would.  Not kill you.  But blow off a few toes, absolutely. I'm entitled to that as retribution.  It'll help you to remember me in years to come -- every time you put on stockings. They must have prosthetic toes by now -- with little nails on them you can polish --	Stop talking like that!
4 Then scream for me.  A repeat performance.  Let me see how easy you can turn it on.  Scream!  I want to hear you scream for me!

1 What's really on your wicked little mind?	The cop in the trunk -- he could still be alive.
2 That's a reasonable possibility.	He might've heard everything we said in the car.
3 What's your point?	We can't leave him to repeat anything.
4 Which one of us is elected to do the deed?	You're the man with the gun.
5 Naturally.	Naturally.
6 Maybe your friends already accomplished that chore for us.	Only one way to find out.

1 I've got ... one last number for you, Theo ...	I don't want it.
2 My fence in San Francisco ... 305-4410.  Maurice.  Don't take less than a third on the face value of those bonds.	Sure, like I'm gonna take advice from you.
3 I told you ... sooner or later you'd have to trust me ...

1 We're waiting on you.	Then just wait.  I'm counting this all out and deducting my share. While I'm at it you can be getting that tape off the lady.  And her little girl.
2 It's in the process.	I make my end of the cash at 184,000.  Now I'm trying to figure out the bonds.  What the face value is.
3 You should've done all this before.	I'm not accepting criticism today. Now don't make me lose count. There's already a half million in this portfolio.
4 Her husband said there'd be one million eight.  So nine hundred to you.	My pleasure --
5 Be careful in disposing of them. You'll have to discount 'em. You'll be lucky to clear a hundred and a quarter.	Thanks for the sound advice.  Now ask the woman to get out of the van and walk over here.  Alone.
6 Negative.	You'll still have the girl and the husband.
7 And not a nickel.	Soon as Mrs. Oberfeld is in my car I'll toss out your first third. Then I'll back up 200 feet to behind the public restroom.
8 And then?	You pull up -- collect your first installment.  Then you let the daughter go.  When she reaches me, I'll dump out another third.  Same action.  I back up again -- you pull forward.  Satisfy yourself it's there.  Then we do it one last time.  The final exchange. And we go our separate ways.
9 And they run straight to the cops who start looking for our van.	I won't let 'em.

1 You researched me.  You know where I live.  She'll be waiting for you there along with your split.	There's two police cars now.
2 Tailgate me.  I'll jam on the brakes.  You go into a spin to avoid an accident and cut them off.	You want us to get ourselves killed?
3 From what I can see you're a pretty fair wheelman.  There's a hairpin coming up -- that's the place for it. The cops'll plow right into you.	And I end up in a fucking neck brace for life!
4 Then you can sue the cops. Collect from both ends.  Tighten your belts.  Here it comes.  Ready?

1 I'm in awe.	Following which we will have a serious question and answer session with your girlfriend.

1 Scottish?	Yeah.

1 He agreed that he was.	What do you think his name is?
2 I've no thoughts on the subject.

1 See, they get the wrong idea.	Cunt.

1 Is that his tart? Does Pat have a tart?	She's not a tart.
2 No, of course not, she's a lady.	She's not that either.

1 No.	Scottish?
2 How'd you guess?	The accent, I suppose.
3 And what's it like?	Like treacle.

1 You want me to ask you in, right?	No, I didn't --
2 But I'm not cheap, you know that? Loud, but never cheap.

1 Someone out there.	Jesus fucking Christ.

1 Did he come here too?	Is this an obsession of yours?
2 Maybe.	He did sometimes.
3 Did he dance with you?

1 Come on, Dil --	Where?

1 Don't.	Sorry.
2 I should have known, shouldn't I?	Probably.
3 Kind of wish I didn't.	You can always pretend.
4 That's true.... Your soldier knew, didn't he?	Absolutely.
5 Won't be quite the same though, will it?	Are you pretending yet?
6 I'm working on it.

1 Shouldn't be, Dil	Why shouldn't I be jealous?

1 Don't call me that --	Sorry. What you doing?

1 Are you supposed to take that many?	Only in times of extreme stress.

1 See, I fix on anyone that's nice to me. Just the littlest bit nice and I'm yours.	Stop it, Dil --
2 Just don't kick Dil and she'll be touched. Be nice to her and she'll be yours forever.

1 Dil!!!	I asked you a question, honey -- were you there too --

1 Fergus!	You're back in the pink, Tommy? How're you keeping?

1 We had a court-martial in your absence. They wanted to put a bullet in your head. I pleaded for clemency. Said we should find out what happened first. So what did happen?	He ran. I couldn't shoot him in the back. I tried to catch him. He made it to the road and got hit by a Saracen.
2 So you did fuck up.	Yes.
3 But you know what the thing is, Fergus?	No, what is the thing?
4 You vanished quite effectively. Became Mister Nobody. And you've no idea how useful that could be.	What do you mean?
5 We've got some plans here. And we'll need a Mister Nobody to execute them.	No way, Jude. I'm out.
6 You're never out, Fergus.

1 Give him a cup of tea.	Do you want a cup of tea?

1 I'm getting emotional. And I don't want to get fucking emotional -- you understand, Hennessy?	I understand.
2 Fuck you, too --

1 Please, man, I'm suffocating in here.	Can't we take it off?

1 Well, in Antigua cricket's the black man's game. The kids play it from the age of two. My daddy had me throwing googlies from the age of five. Then we moved to Tottenham and it was something different.	How different?
2 Toffs' game there. But not at home.     .

1 See? I was right about you.	Don't be so sure.
2 Jody's always right.

1 Nothing.	Tell me something, anything.

1 Not here.	Who gives a fuck.
2 You never know.

1 Give me the shooter, Jude --	You're crazy --
2 Give me the fucking shooter!

1 When you come on, you really come on.	Well -- come on.

1 You're right. I remember Grandpierre looking through it. But there was nothing in it -- at least, nothing that the police thought was very important.	Can you remember anything at all?
2 Grandpierre asked me about an appointment Charles had -- on the day he was killed.	With whom? Where?
3 I think it only said where -- but I can't --	Think, Reggie, you've got to think -- it may be what we're looking for.
4 That money's not ours, Adam -- if we keep it, we'll be breaking the law.	Nonsense. We didn't steal it. There's no law against stealing stolen money.
5 Of course there is!	There is? Well, I can't say I think very much of a silly law like that. Think, Reggie -- please think -- what was written in Charles' notebook?
6 Well -- it was a place -- a street corner, I think. But I don't --  Hold it. I'm on.

1 You didn't have to chase me so hard --	Here, give it to me.

1 Here's where you're to call me -- day or night. It's a direct line to both my office and my apartment. Don't lose it, Mrs. Lampert -- and please don't tell anyone about coming to see me. It could prove fatal for them as well as yourself.	Wait a minute -- you think those three men killed Charles, don't you?
2 We've no proof, of course, but we rather think so, yes.	Well, there you are! Charles had the money with him -- so whoever killed him has it -- they have it!

1 Yes -- ?	Mrs. Lampert? -- Bartholomew. I've spoken to Washington, Mrs. Lampert --
2 Go ahead, Mr. Bartholomew -- I'm listening.	I told them what you said -- about this man being Carson Dyle's brother. I asked them what they knew about it and they told me -- you're not gonna like this, Mrs. Lampert -- they told me Carson Dyle has no brother.

1 How long do you intend -- ?	I said with the mouth shut.

1 We'd better exchange keys. Here's mine.	I'll take that.

1 The phone's ringing --	Whoever it is won't give up -- and neither will I.

1 Maybe somebody felt that four shares were too many --	What makes you think that this somebody will be satisfied with three? He wants it all, Alex -- that means we're in his way, too.
2 Yes, I know.	First your brother, then Charles, now Scobie -- we've got to do something! Any minute now we could be assassinated! Would you do anything like that?
3 What? Assassinate somebody?	No --

1 I can explain if you'll just listen. Will you listen?	I can't very well leave without a pair of water wings.
2 Okay. Then get set for the story of my life -- not that it would ever make the best-seller list.	Fiction or non-fiction?
3 Why don't you shut up!	Well!
4 Are you going to listen?	Go on.
5 After I graduated college I was all set to go into my father business. Umbrella frames -- that's what he made. It was a sensible business, I suppose, but I didn't have the sense to be interested in anything sensible.	I suppose all this is leading somewhere?
6 It led me away from umbrella frames, for one thing. But that left me without any honest means of support.	What do you mean?
7 When a man has no profession except the one he loathes, what's left? I began looking for people with more money than they'd ever need -- including some they'd barely miss.	You mean, you're a thief?
8 Well, it isn't exactly the term I'd have chosen, but I suppose it captures the spirit of the thing.	I don't believe it.
9 Well, I can't really blame you -- not now.	But I do believe it -- that's what I don't believe. So it's goodbye Alexander Dyle -- Welcome home Peter Joshua.
10 Sorry, the name's Adam Canfield.	Adam Canfield. Wonderful. Do you realize you've had three names in the past two days? I don't even know who I'm talking to any more.
11 The man's the same, even if the name isn't.	No -- he's not the same. Alexander Dyle was interested in clearing up his brother's death. Adam Canfield is a crook. And with all the advantages you've got -- brains, charm, education, a handsome face --

1 What do you mean, no?	The kid said --

1 If you will sign this list you may take the things with you.	Is that all? Can I go now?
2 One more question. Is this your husband's passport?

1 Jean-Louis -- thank heavens! Do you have -- !  What's that?	A man traded with me -- all those for only four.
2 Oh no! What man, Jean-Louis --  where?

1 Right there, between your eyes -- see? Worry lines. You're much too young and too pretty to have anything like that. How about making me vice- president in charge of cheering you up?	Starting tonight?

1 There was no trace of him. All right, Reggie -- suppose you tell me what this is all about.	There are three men -- he's one of them -- they think I have something that belongs to them.
2 What?	A quarter of a million dollars.

1 Stop that!	Don't make too much noise, Miz Lampert --

1 Do you know him?	I've never seen him before.
2 He must have known Charles pretty well.	How can you tell?
3 He's allergic to him.

1 Yeah?	I'm Lisa Sherman. Dylan's aunt. He asked me to come talk to you.
2 Why?	He feels terrible about those things he said to you in school.
3 He should. Four guys hit on me today, and not because they find me intellectually stimulating.	I think I know how to restore your reputation.
4 You do?	Can I come in? I'll need to use the phone.

1 Why'd you send for Lenny Marliston?	The kids adore him. They confide in him. His patchouli reeking rear might know if Stacy and Rod were really virgins. Why didn't you ask Jody that?
2 She's my daughter, Tom.	So?
3 So you just don't point blank ask your teenage daughter about sex.	Why not? You worried you might find out how much she actually knows?

1 It was a she.	Are you sure?
2 She said she was Kenny's aunt Lisa.

1 What are you doing?	This will relax her.
2 She's underage.

1 You fucked me up!	What?
2 You gave me a 'D'.	I'm sure you should have failed.
3 I was grounded for two fucking months because of you!

1 Go sit next to him.	Who?
2 Mark Shale.	Why?
3 Don't you want to talk to him? You watch him eat everyday.	I don't watch him eat everyday.
4 You stare at him non-stop, like every lunch. Like this. Like most people stare at car accidents.

1 Someone tried to kill me.	The phone just went dead. I called the police and ran right over as fast as I could.

1 If you don't want to go with me just say so. Say 'Kenny, I DON'T WANT TO MAKE LOVE TO YOU' but don't use your dad as an excuse. I'm so sick of it.	I'm not using him as an excuse.
2 Yes you are. You always do. It's why we broke up. You always hide behind him.	I do not.
3 I feel like I NEED YOU DAD'S permission just to kiss you. Jody, it's time to assert yourself To be a big girl. An individual. I'm going to this party tonight. Jimmy's my ride. Come over to my house after school. We'll go together.	I have to go home after school. I have something really important I have to ask my mom.
4 They're not picking me up until six.	I'll think about it.
5 Yes!

1 Oh GOD IT'S HIM!	Quick! In the house. He won't look for us in there.

1 THAT'S why he called Mr. Sisler first. He was one of them.	Not a day has gone by where your father has not torn himself to shreds for what happened. We both have...
2 NO!

1 You're so beautiful.	So are you.
2 Now don't be nervous.	You're the one who's hand is shaking.

1 Okay, here we go.	
2 Come here.	Go, go, go!

1 Stupid.	I'm gonna kill him.

4 Well, then, how about a ruler?	A ruler?
5 The print's pretty fine. I forgot my glasses. I'd like to be able to read across.

1 At my age, you tend to lose track...	Well, It was about five days ago. You were outside the Pig 'n Whistle and you had one hell of an argument.

1 You're absolutely right, I wouldn't give her another thought.	You know, you're okay, Mr. Gittes. I know it's your job, but you're okay.
2 Thanks, Curly. Call me Jake.	Thanks. You know something, Jake?
3 What's that, Curly?	I think I'll kill her.

1 There's seven ashtrays in this room, Duffy.	Okay.
2 That's a filthy habit.	I said okay, Jake.
3 Yeah, yeah. If she'd come in here saying she was Shirley Temple you'd say okay to that, too.

1 You wouldn't happen to know the present whereabouts of the young woman.	No.
2 Or her name?	No.

1 What are you talking about?	C'mon I'll show you.

1 ...Well, it didn't make him happy...	But there is no possibility he would have taken his own life?
2 No.	Mrs. Mulwray, do you happen to know the name of the young woman in question?

1 You see, somebody went to a lot of trouble here, and I want to find out, lawsuit or no lawsuit. I'm not the one who's supposed to be caught with my pants down... so I'd like to see your husband. Unless that's a problem.	What do you mean?
2 May I speak frankly, Mrs. Mulwray?	You may if you can, Mr. Gittes.
3 Well, that little girlfriend, she was attractive in a cheap sort of way of course.  She's disappeared. Maybe they disappeared together somewhere.	Suppose they did. How does it concern you?
4 Nothing personal, Mrs. Mulwray, I just --	It's very personal. It couldn't be more personal. Is this a business or an obsession with you?
5 Look at it this way. Now this phony broad, excuse the language, says she's you, she's hired me. Whoever put her up to it, didn't have anything against me. They were out to get your husband. Now if I see him, I can help him.  Did you talk this morning?

1 Unless what?	She's cheating on him.

1 Your father is Julian Cross, isn't he?	Yes, of course. It was quite a while after. I was just out of grade school when they did that.
2 So you married your father's business partner?

1 It was in Chinatown.	What were you doing there?
2 Working for the District Attorney.	Doing what?

1 Just tell me the truth. I'm not the police. I don't care what you've done. I'm not going to hurt you, but one way or another I'm going to know.	You won't go to the police if I tell you?
2 I will if you don't.

1 I said I want the truth.	She's my sister and my daughter!

1 Sophie... is Walsh there?... yeah, listen, pal, Escobar's going to try and book me in about five minutes... relax, I'll tell you. Wait in the office for two hours. If you don't hear from me, you and Duffy meet me at 1712 Alameda.	Jesus, that's in Chinatown, ain't it?

1 That's exactly what we wanted to hear.	Oh, good.
2 I wonder, is it too late for us to have a look around?	I don't think so. Be happy to show you.
3 Would you mind if we took a stroll on our own?	Just, if you will, confine yourself to the main building. It's nearly bedtime.
4 We understand, c'mon, sweetheart.

1 Speak English?... Habla Ingles?	Si.
2 Didn't you talk to a man here... few days ago... wore glasses... he...

1 No, really?	I'm afraid so.
2 I am sorry.

1 This?	They got into a terrific argument outside the Pig 'n Whistle.
2 What about?	I don't know. The traffic was pretty loud. I only heard one thing  apple core.
3 Apple core?	Yeah.

1 Lots of fellas do. Tell the little woman they're going on a fishing trip, then shack up with some little twist on the island... she pretty?	I'm going to see a man called Julian Cross. Ever heard of him?
2 Is the Pope Catholic? Who are you, mister?... I ask because he doesn't see a whole lot of people.	I'm working for his daughter.
3 That right?... She used to be some looker.	She ain't exactly long in the tooth now.
4 She must be about thirty-three, thirty- four.	You must be thinking of a different daughter.
5 No, he's only got one, I remember her age, I read it in the newspapers when she ran away.	She ran away?
6 Oh yeah, it was a big thing at the time. Julian Cross' daughter. God almighty. She was a wild little thing.

1 Now listen to what I've got to say. I took up this profession when I was ten years old. In those days there weren't these modern machines. The films were silent. The projectors were run by hand, like this, with a crank. And you wound the crank all day long. It was really rough going! If you got tired and slowed down' boom! Everything would go up in flames!	Then why don't you want to teach it to me too? Now that there's no more cranking, and it's easier?
2 Because I don't want to, Toto! This is not a job for you. It's like being a slave. You're always alone. You see the same film over and over again, because you have nothing else to do. And you start talking to Greta Garbo and Tyrone Power like a nut! You work on holidays, on Christmas, on Easter. Only on Good Friday are you free. But if they hadn't put Jesus Christ on a cross...You'd work Good Fridays too!	Then why don't you change jobs? 
3 Because I'm an idiot. How many other guys in town know how to be a projectionist? None! Only a jerk like me could do it. Besides I wasn't lucky. When I was a kid there was the war! When I grew up, another war! Now it's all different. Times have changed. And you want to be a dope like me? Huh? Answer me!	No...
4 Good for you, Toto. Good for you... I'm only saying this for your own good...  Cooped up in here you die of heat in the summer and of cold in the winter. You breathe in smoke, gas fumes, and earn practically nothing. 	But don't you like anything about what you do? 
5 With time...you get used to it. Besides, when you hear from up here that there's a full house and that people are laughing, having fun... Then you're happy too.  So I've been wasting my breath? You pretend to agree with me, but as soon as my back is turned, you do what you want!  Get out of here! I don't want to lay eyes on you again! This is the last straw! Your mother's right, you're crazy!!  But how'd he do it? The little bastard! By watching, he's learned! It's incredible!  I'm letting the box office know you're not to set foot even into the theatre! There are no more tickets for you! And I'm also talking to Father Adelfio! You won't be an altar boy any more either!!! You little runt! 	Alfredo, go fuck yourself!!! 

1 Yes, it's a girl I saw at the station.	What's she like? What's she like?...

1 Thanks for all you've done for me.	Whatever you do, love it like you loved that projection booth of the Paradiso when you were little... 

1 Elena!...But when...	I got back today. You can't imagine the excuses I had to make up to be here...

1 No, Salvatore...there is no future. There's only the past. Even meeting last night was nothing but a dream, a beautiful dream.  We never did it when we were kids, remember?  Now that it's happened, I don't think there could have been a better ending. 	I'll never agree with you. Never, Elena.

1 But why do you call me 'Mr. Di Vita'? It didn't used to be that way...	Well, it's hard to call an important person by his first name. But if it really matters to you, I'11 call you...  Toto!...

1 I've just made a shocking discovery. The "Enquirer" is without a telephone. Have two installed at once!	I ordered six already this morning! Got a discount!

1 Ask them to sit down, Mr. Bernstein.	Sit down, everybody - for heaven's sake!

1 We'll be on the street soon, Charlie - another ten minutes.	It's three hours and fifty minutes late - but we did it -

1 If you thought I'd answer different from what Mr. Kane tells you - well, I wouldn't.	

1 I'm not criticizing, Mr. Carter, but here's what I mean.  There's a front page story in the "Chronicle,"  and a picture - of a woman in Brooklyn who is missing.  Probably murdered.  A Mrs. Harry Silverstone.  Why didn't the "Enquirer" have that this morning?	Because we're running a newspaper, Mr. Kane, not a scandal sheet.

1 Let him finish, Charles.	I'm protecting myself every way I know how, Mrs. Kane.  This last week, I finally found out how I can stop your husband from being elected. If the people of this state learn what I found out this week, he wouldn't have a chance to - he couldn't be elected Dog Catcher.  Well, what I'm interested in is seeing that he's not elected.  I don't care whether they know what I know about him.  Let him keep right on being the Great, Noble, Moral -  Champeen of the people.  Just as long as -
2 I think I understand, Mr. Rogers, but I wonder if - 

1 Here I am, darling...  Darling!... Darling, it's all right...  Mother's here.	Emily - you musn't leave me now - you can't do that to me.
2 They won't hurt you, darling. Mother's with you!  Mother's looking after you!

1 You can't blackmail me, Rogers, you can't -	Charlie, he said, unless you withdrew your name -

1 Oh!	I can't stay here all night chasing your pain away.
2 I know...  But you do look so silly.

1 You'll never have another chance to hit me again.  I never knew till this minute -	Susan, it seems to me -
2 Don't tell me you're sorry.	I'm not sorry.
3 I'm going to leave you.	No, you're not.
4 Yes.

1 Impossible!  Impossible!	Your job isn't to give Mrs. Kane your opinion of her talents. You're supposed to train her voice. Nothing more.
2 But, it is impossible.  I will be the laughingstock of the musical world!  People will say -	If you're interested in what people say, Signor Matisti, I may be able to enlighten you a bit.  The newspapers, for instance.  I'm an authority on what the papers will say, Signor Matisti, because I own eight of them between here and San Francisco...  It's all right, dear. Signor Matisti is going to listen to reason.  Aren't you, maestro? 
3 Mr. Kane, how can I persuade you -	You can't.

1 Is Mrs. Kane - 	Marie has been packing since morning, Mr. Kane.

1 The "Chronicle" is a good newspaper.	It's a good idea for a newspaper.  Four hundred sixy thousand.

1 Charlie, it's just no go.  We can't agree anymore.  I wish you'd let me go to Chicago.	Why, Brad?
2 I want to be transferred to the new paper.  You've been saying yourself you wish you had somebody to -  That's not what I wanted to talk about.

1 Maybe we'd better wait for more word on the President's condition.	What do you mean by that?

1 What's this?	It's a letter from her lawyers.
2 David, Grobleski & Davis -  My dear Rawlston - 	Rawlston is my boss.
3 Oh, yes.  I know about Mr. Rawlston.	He knows the first Mrs. Kane socially -  That's the answer we got.
4 I am in receipt of your favor of yesterday.  I beg you to do me the courtesy of accepting my assurance that Mrs. Whitehall cannot be induced to contribute any more information on the career of Charles Foster Kane. She has authorized me to state on previous occasions that she regards their brief marriage as a distateful episode in her life that she prefers to forget.  With assurances of the highest esteem -

1 Yes, and maybe he didn't.	Ask the question anyway, Thompson! Build the picture around the question, even if you can't answer it.
2 I know, but -	All we saw on that screen was a big American -

1 How did you meet him?	I had a toothache.

1 Well, if it's already too late...	It's never too late. Give those cigarettes back now, and buy some gum instead.  Here. Chewlies Gum. Try this.
2 It's not the same.	It's cheaper than cigarettes. And it certainly beats this.

1 Randal Graves-scourge of the video renter.	Ladies and gentleman, Mrs. Asian Design Major herself: Caitlin Bree!
2 You saw that article? God, isn't it awful? My mother sent that in.	I take it she likes the guy.
3 You'd think she was marrying him. What are you watching?	Children's programming. What did your mom say when you told her you weren't engaged anymore?
4 She said not to come home until graduation.	Wow, you got thrown out? For Dante?
5 What can I say? He does weird things to me.	Can I watch?
6 You can hold me down.	Can I join in?
7 You might be let down. I'm not a hermaphrodite.	Few are. So what makes you think you can maintain a relationship with Dante this time around?
8 A woman's intuition. Something in me says it's time to give the old boy a serious try.	Wow. Hey, I was just about to order some dinner. You eat Chinese, right?
9 Dick.	Exactly.
10 So where is he?	He went home to change for the big date.
11 God, isn't he great?	No, this is great.
12 Can I use the bathroom?	There's no light back there.
13 Why aren't there any lights?	Well, there are, but for some reason they stop working at five-fourteen every night.
14 You're kidding.	Nobody can figure it out. And the boss doesn't want to pay the electrician to fix it, because the electrician owes money to the video store.
15 Such a sordid state of affair.	And I'm caught in the middle-torn between my loyalty for the boss, and my desire to piss with the light on.
16 I'll try to manage.

1 Promise me it'll always be like that.	Like what?
2 When you just lie perfectly still and let me do everything.	Um... okay.

1 Well he asked me for it!	I can't say for certain until we get him back to the lab, but my guess is he was masturbating, his heart seized and he died. That's when the girl found him.  Something smells like shoe polish.

1 My point is that you're a clerk, paid to do a job. You can't just do anything you want while you're working.	"Space Alien Revealed as Head of Time Warner; Reports Stock Increase."  They print any kind of shit in these papers.
2 They certainly do. Two fifty-five.

1 Cute cat. What's his name.	Peptic ulcer.

1 Want something to drink? I'm buying.	No, thanks.
2 Who was on your phone this morning at about two-thirty? I was trying to call for a half an hour.	Why?
3 I wanted to use your car.

1 Oh, it's great. You step into this little booth and there's this window between you and this naked woman, and she puts on this little show for like ten bucks.	What kind of show?
2 Think of the weirdest, craziest shit you'd like to see chicks do.  These chicks do it all. They insert things into any opening in their body... any opening.  He's led a very sheltered life.	Can we talk about this later?
3 The jizz-mopper's job is to clean up the booths afterward, because practically everybody shoots a load against the window, and I don't know if you know or not, but cum leaves streaks if you don't clean it right away.

1 Are you gonna lock the store?	I don't know. You going to lock the video store?
2 Look who you're asking here. How're we gonna block off the street?	We're not playing in the street.
3 Then where're we gonna play?

1 I can't fucking believe you!!	I'm telling you, it wasn't my fault!
2 You knocked the fucking casket over, for Chrissakes!	I was just leaning on it! It was an accident!
3 Does anyone ever knock over a casket on purpose?	So the casket fell over! Big deal!
4 Her fucking body fell out!	So they'll put her back in! It's not like it's gonna matter if she breaks something!
5 Just... go! Go open the video store.

1 Who eats cock?	Bunch of savages in this town.  Hey, Caitlin's in the back. You might want to see if she's okay; she's been back there a long time.
2 There's no lights back there.	I told her that. She said she didn't need any. Why don't you join her, man. Make a little bathroom bam-bam.
3 I love your sexy talk. It's so... kindergarten: Poo-poo; wee-wee.	Fuck you.

1 You still didn't have to choke me.	Oh please! I'm surprised I didn't kill you.
2 Why do you say that?	Why do I say that?  Randal... forget it.
3 No, really. What did I do that was so wrong?	What don't you do?  Randal, sometimes it seems like the only reason you come to work is to make my life miserable.
4 How do you figure?	What time did you get to work today?
5 Like ten after.	You were over half an hour late. Then all you do is come over here.
6 To talk to you.	Which means the video store is ostensibly closed.
7 It's not like I'm miles away.	Unless you're out renting videos at other video stores.
8 Hermaphrodites! I rented it so we could watch it together!	You get my slapped with a fine, you fight with the customers and I have to patch everything up. You get us chased out of a funeral by violating a corpse. To top it all off, you ruin my relationship. What's your encore? Do you anally rape my mother while pouring sugar in my gas tank?  You know what the real tragedy is? I'm not even supposed to be here today!
9 Fuck you. Fuck you, pal. Listen to you trying to pass the buck again. I'm the source of all your misery. Who closed the store to play hockey? Who closed the store to attend a wake? Who tried to win back an ex- girlfriend without even discussing how he felt with his present one? You wanna blame somebody, blame yourself.  "I'm not even supposed to be here today."  You sound like an asshole. Whose choice was it to be here today? Nobody twisted your arm. You're here today of your own violation, my friend. But you'd like to believe that the weight of the world rests on your shoulders-that the store would crumble if Dante wasn't here. Well, I got news for you, jerk: This store would survive without you. Without me either. All you do is overcompensate for having what's basically a monkey's job: You push fucking buttons. Any moron can waltz in here and do our jobs, but you're obsessed with making it seem so much more fucking important, so much more epic than it really is. You work in a convenience store, Dante. And badly, I might add. And I work in a shitty video store.  Badly, as well.  You know, that guy Jay's got it right- he has no delusions about what he does. Us?  We like to make ourselves seem so much better than the people that come in here, just looking to pick up a paper or-God forbid- cigarettes. We look down on them, as it we're so advanced.  Well, if we're so fucking advanced, then what are we doing working here?

1 Sounds to me like somebody needs to hit the gym.	Excuse me?
2 I heard you strain when you put the milk in the bag. That milk only weighs about seven pounds.	I didn't strain. I sighed.
3 I don't think so. That was a grunt; a deep inhalation of oxygen to aid in the stretching of muscles. I'm a trainer. I know what that sound signifies: you're out of shape.	I don't think so.
4 Oh, I do. You made the same noise when you reached across the counter for my cash. Your muscles are thin and sadly underutilized.	They are not.
5 Yes, they are. You're out of shape.	What are you talking about? There's no fat on this body.
6 No fat, but no tone either. You don't get enough exercise.

1 Noinch, noinch, noinch-smoking weed, smoking weed! Doing coke!  Drinking beers!  A pack of wraps, my good man. It's time to kick back, drink some beers, and smoke some weed!	Done poisoning the youth for the day?
2 Hell yes, whatever that means. Now I'm gonna head over to Atlantic, drink some beers, get ripped, and- please God-get laid.  E-Z Wider, one-and-a-halfs.	One seventy-nine.
3 Pay the good man.  Don't you close soon?	A half hour.
4 We get off about the same time every night. We should hang out.  You get high?	I should start.
5 Wanna come to this party tonight? There's gonna be some pussy there, man!	With you? I don't think so.
6 Listen to you. Oh shit. "Oh, I don't hang out with drug dealers."	Nothing personal.

1 How much money did you leave up there?	Like three dollars in mixed change and a couple of singles. People only get the paper of coffee this time of morning.
2 You're trusting.	Why do you say that?
3 How do you know they're taking the right amount of change? Or even paying for what they take?	Theoretically, people see money on the counter and nobody around, they think they're being watched.
4 Honesty through paranoia. Why do you smell like shoe polish?	I had to use shoe polish to make that sign. The smell won't come off.
5 Do you think anyone can see us down here?	Why? You wanna have sex or something?
6 Ooh! Can we?!	Really?
7 I was kidding.	Yeah, right. You can't get enough of me.
8 Typically male point of view.	How do you figure?
9 You show some bedroom proficiency, and you think you're gods. What about what we do for you?	Women? Women, as lovers, are all basically the same: they just have to be there.
10 "Be there?"	Making a male climax is not all that challenging: insert somewhere close and preferably moist; thrust; repeat.
11 How flattering.	Now, making a woman cum... therein lies a challenge.
12 Oh, you think so?	A girl makes a guy cum, it's standard. A guy makes a girl cum, it's talent.
13 And I actually date you?	Something wrong?
14 I'm insulted. Believe me, Don Juan, it takes more than that to get a guy off. Just "being there"-as you put it-is not enough.	I touched a nerve.
15 I'm astonished to hear you trivialize my role in our sex life.	It wasn't directed at you. I was making a broad generalization.
16 You were making a generalization about "broads!"	These are my opinions based on my experiences with the few women who were good enough to sleep with me.
17 How many?	How many what?
18 How many girls have you slept with?	How many different girls? Didn't we already have this discussion once?
19 We might have; I don't remember. How many?	Including you?
20 It better be up to and including me.	Twelve.
21 You've slept with twelve different girls?	Including you; yes.

1 What the fuck did you do that for?	If you didn't want to go out with me anymore, why didn't you just say it? Instead, you pussyfoot around and see that slut behind my back!
2 What're you talking about?	You've been talking to her on the phone for weeks!
3 It was only a few times...	And then you pull that shit this morning, freaking out because I've gone down on a couple guys!
4 A couple...?	I'm not the one trying to patch things up with my ex, sneaking around behind your back! And if you think that thirty-seven dicks are a lot, then just wait, mister: I'm going to put the hookers in Times Square to shame with all the guys I go down on now!
5 Would you let me explain...	Explain what? How you were waiting until the time was right, and then you were going to dump me for her?
6 Veronica... I... it's not like that anymore... I mean, it was never really like that...

1 Oh shit, look who it is. The human vacuum.	Scumbag. What are you doing?
2 Nothing. Just hanging out with Silent Bob and his cousin.	He's your cousin?
3 Check this out, he's from Russia.	No way.
4 I swear to God. Silent Bob, am I lying?

1 Let me ask you a question: Do you think this guy's out of shape?	I don't know. I can't really tell from here.
2 He is.

1 You've never heard anybody say anything about either movie?	I find it's best to stay out of other people's affairs.
2 Well, how about these two movies? 

1 Did you catch that thunder?	No way, death-breath, that was too intense for thunder.  C'mon let's rock an' roll.

1 Jessie, Hal, come in...please report.  Over.	Where's the radio?

1 Glad you could drop in.	Hey, anything for a friend. How's the knee?
2 I think it's out.  No big deal. It's that old football injury.	Funny, he told me he twisted it gettin' out of a hot tub.
3 I love you, too.	Rescue One -- have located helpless climber, please prepare <u>idiot line</u> for transport, over.
4 Wait 'til you get into trouble, just wait.

1 I'm going with you.	Not on that leg.
2 Take the gun.	You keep it.  Get up there if you can, and if you get a chance, do me a favor and kill him.

1 Use your other hand!  Grab it!	Help me!  I don't want to die!
2 You're not gonna die.  Grab me with your other hand!

1 If he gets up there and the weather gets as bad as it can, they'll never make it down.  He needs someone who has emergency medical training and knows every handhold on these peaks.	He doesn't want my help.
2 That's not the issue here, those people are.  He can't do it alone.	He can handle it.
3 What if he can't?	I haven't climbed in months--you lose the feel.
4 You mean the nerve.

1 Why can't things stay the way they are...everything has to change.  What we had was perfect.	I don't know.  Here, lay down and get some rest.  We're going to need it.

1 They'll kill him!  He has no idea!	We gotta get out and fire a flare.  It's the only chance!

1 But maybe with a good start I can hit those hand-holds.	Hand-holds?!  I can barely see them.
2 We don't have time to argue about it!	Are you crazy?  Has the altitude shrunk your brain, Gabe?
3 Take the rope.	I won't do it.  No way.
4 Take the rope.	Enough's enough.  How could anybody in their right mind... then again, you never were in your right mind.
5 Wrap it around that rock twice.	I'm going to wrap it around your throat!
6 An' if I miss, dig in and try your best to slow the fall.	Forget it!  I refuse!
7 Fine, it shouldn't bother your conscience.	Don't lay any guilt on me. Suicide's a personal thing, best done alone.

1 Mr. Travers is not the athletic type, he needs something more direct.	The only faster way up is the East Face and it's smooth as glass.  Maybe a dozen guys in the world could do it in good weather, only a psycho would try it in a storm.

1 Yeah...	Anyone else following?

1 You gotta be kidding me!  Do you want me to fly up after you? Over.	<u>Negative</u>.  The winds are too high.  I'm going to ride out the storm here.  I'll take shelter in the Douglas Exhibition Shaft. Over and out.

1 Don't use my name!	Ask the questions.
2 You're both with the mountain rescue team?

1 Good, Travers.  It might catch on, like shooting skeet.	You dumb bastard, you waited too long.  If he made it back, this place would have been covered with police in a few hours.  The way we're moving, it's going to be anyway.

1 Sorry about the pain. Using the gulliver to much like, eh? Giving orders and disciplining and that perhaps, eh? You sure the pain's gone? You sure you'll not be happier back up in bed.	Lets get things nice and sparkling clear. This sarcasm, if I may call it such, does not become you, O my brothers. As I am your droog and leader, I am entitled to know what goes on, eh? Now then, Dim, what does that great big horsy gape of a grin portend?

1 Very kind of you, sir. Thank you very much.	I understand that you had a rather unfortunate encounter with the Police tonight.
2 Yes, sir. I suppose you might call it that, sir.	Hahaha, and how are you feeling now?
3 Much better, thank you, sir.	Feel like talking to us. Answering a few questions?
4 Fine, sir, fine.	Well, as I've said, we've heard about you. We are interested in your case. We want to help you.
5 Thank you very much, sir.	But first we'd like to find out a few things about you.
6 What would you like to know, sir?	Well, shall we get down to it?
7 Yes, sir. Rubinstein takes out a notebook.

1 Not tonight - not this nochy.	Come, come, come, Georgie Boy. You're a big strong chelloveck like us all. We're not little children, are we, Georgie Boy? What, then, didst thou in thy mind have? Confrontation. Georgie backs down.
2 It's this Health Farm. A bit out of the town. Isolated. It's owned by this like very rich ptitsa who lives there with her cats. The place is shut down for a week and she's completely on her own, and it's full up with like gold and silver and like jewels.	Tell me more, Georgie Boy.

1 Hello, heap of dirt. Pooh, you don't wash much do you, judging by the horrible smell.	Why do you say that, brother? I had a shower this morning.
2 Oh, he had a shower this morning. You trying to call me a liar?	No, brother. What d'you want?
3 What do I want?	Sorry, brother. I didn't mean any offence.
4 Oh. Oh, you're sorry are you, well you must think I'm awfully stupid. He slaps Alex in the face.	Why did you do that, brother? I've never done wrong to you.
5 You want to know why I did that, well you see - I do that... He stamps on Alex's foot.	... and this... He pulls Alex's nose.
6 ... and that... He pulls Alex's ear, pushes him off balance and plants his foot on his chest.	... because I don't like you horrible type, do I, and if you want to start something... if you want to start... go on... well, you just start. Please do. Alex retching.
7 I'm gonna be sick.	You're gonna be sick are you?
8 I wanna be sick.	You wanna be sick?
9 Let me get up.	You wanna get up? Well, you've gotta you see... well I want you to lick it. Go on... Lick it. Alex, gagging and coughing, licks the sole of his shoe.
10 ... And again... Go on!!! Again! There's a good boy.	And, O my brothers, would you believe your faithful friend and long suffering narrator pushed out his red yahzik a mile and a half to lick the grahzny, vonny boots. The horrible killing sickness had wooshed up and turned the like joy of battle into a feeling I was going to snuff it. Minister rises.

1 Good morning, Alex, my name is Dr. Branom. I'm Doctor Brodsky's assistant.	Good Morning, Missus. Lovely day, isn't it?
2 Indeed it is. May I take this She removes his tray.	How're you feeling this morning?
3 Fine... fine.	Good. In a few minutes, you'll meeting Dr. Brodsky and we'll begin your treatment. You're a very lucky boy to have been chosen.
4 I realise all that, Missus, and I'm very grateful to all concerned.	We're going to friends now, sir.
5 I hope so, Missus. She inserts a needle into the medicine vial.	What's the hypo for then? Going to send me to sleep?
6 Oh no, nothing of the sort.	Vitamins will it be then?
7 Something like that. You are a little undernourished, so after each meal were going to give you a shot. Roll over on your right side please, loosen your pyjama pants and pull them half-way down. He does, somewhat reluctantly. She gives him a shot in the bum.	What exactly is the treatment here going to be then?
8 It's quite simple really. Were just going to show you some films.	You mean like going to the pictures?
9 Something like that.	Well, that's good. I like to viddy the old films now and again.

1 If thou lose hope being weary in the days of distress, thy strength shall be diminished.	Fine, my boy, fine, fine.
2 Father, I have tried, have I not?	You have, my son.
3 I've done my best, have I not?	Indeed.
4 And, Father, I've never been guilty of any institutional infractions, have I?	You certainly have not, 655321. You've been very helpful, and you've shown a genuine desire to reform.
5 Father - may I ask you a question in private?	Certainly, my son, certainly. Is there something troubling you, my son? Don't be shy to speak up. Remember, I know all the urges that can trouble young men deprived of the society of women.
6 No Father. It's nothing like that, Father. It's about this new thing they're all talking about. About this new treatment that you out of prison in no time at all and makes sure you never get back in again.	Where did you hear about this? Whose been talking about these things?
7 These things get around, Father. Two Warders talk as it might be, and somebody can't help overhearing what they say. Then somebody picks up a scrap of newspaper in the workshops and the newspaper tells all about it. How about putting me in for this new treatment, Father?	I take it you are referring to the Ludovico Technique?
8 I don't know what it's called, Father, all I know is that it gets you out quickly and makes sure that you never get in again.	That's not proven, 655321. In fact, it is only in the experimental stage at this moment.
9 But it is being used, isn't it, Father?	It has not been used yet in this prison. The Governor has grave doubts about it and I have heard that there are very serious dangers involved.
10 I don't care about the danger, Father. I just want to be good. I want for the rest of my life to be one act of goodness.	The question is weather or not this technique really makes a man good. Goodness comes from within. Goodness is chosen. When a man cannot chose, he ceases to be a man.
11 I don't understand about the whys and wherefores, Father. I only know I want to be good.	Be patient, my son, and put your trust in the Lord.
12 Instruct thy son and he shall refresh thee and shall give delight to thy soul.	Amen. They cross themselves.

1 Pitiful rookerful...	And there's Will the English in the Muscleman coffee mesto saying he can fence anything that anything that any malchick tries to crast.
2 Yeah... Pete the English.	The shiny stuff. The Ice. The big, big, big money is available's what Will the English says.
3 Big, big money.

1 Shall we go to my office?	Thank you.

1 No, no way, I couldn't take that...	Yes, you could.  I think you need it more than I do.  It'll help.  I promise.

1 ...I was just a young cat back then, about nineteen, bussin' tables in this very place.  Didn't pay but shit, but that wasn't the point.  Being around the music, that was the thing.  And I was.  Take this one night...July 22, 1964...who walks in?  Mr. Louis Armstrong.	You're kidding me.
2 Right through those doors.  The man himself.	Jesus...
3 He'd come over from Queens to do the Ed Sullivan show.  After, he decides to come on up to Harlem and hang with the common folk.  That's how he was, you see.  Never forgot where he came from.  Money and fame an' all that?  Meant nothin', long as he could blow that horn.  So before you it, he's up on that stage, doin' his thing.	Was it great?  Better than great, it had to be...
4 Like Winton Marsalis says, it was pure, spiritual essence.  Louis was playing.  God was smiling.	You heard Armstrong play live.  I've never been this jealous.  You get to talk to him?
5 Did better'n that.

1 Tell me Vincent.  Tell me what you think.	I think...

1 Lemme tell you something.  Vincent and a few other guys like him are fucking ghosts.  Nobody even know what he looked like until now...	I don't know...

1 I was with Max when he got the call.	And you came all the way down here to see me?
2 It's nothing.	Tell my son.  You have to hold a gun to his head to get him to come see me.
3 Tell me about it.

1 You're kidding me.	I'll fuck you up, you don't hand it over.
2 <u>My hands are taped to the fucking </u> <u>steering wheel!</u>

1 Yeah?	Where you been the last two hours? Your mother's been calling every ten minutes whining about how you didn't show up.

1 He fell on my cab!  From up th-th-there.	You always stutter?
2 Yeah, yeah.  Shit, man.  Guy fell on my motherfucking cab.

1 Max.	It's not me.

1 Chopin prelude.  Stodgy, but nice.  Here's the deal.  I didn't want you involved in this.  Still breathing? But now that you are, we have to make the best of it, Max.  Improvise.  Life is that way.  Adapt to your environment.  Survive.  Darwin.  "Shit happens."  The I Ching.  Whatever. Roll with it.	I Ching?  You threw a man out a window!
2 I didn't throw him, he fell.	What'd he do to you?
3 Nothing.  I only met him the one time.	How can you kill him like that?
4 I should only kill people after I get to know 'em?  Six billion people on the planet, you're getting bent out of shape 'cause of one fat guy?	Who was he?
5 What do you care?  Ever hear of Rwanda?	Rwanda-Burundi.  Central Africa.
6 Tens of thousands killed before sundown.  Nobody's killed that fast since Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  Did you bat an eye, Max?  Join Amnesty International?  No.  I off one Angeleno, you throw a hissy fit...

1 Lenny?  You're an asshole.	Tell him next time he pulls any shit, you're gonna kick his fat ass.
2 Next time you pull any shit, I'm gonna kick your fat ass.

1 Show up for what?	Tell her I can't see her tonight, okay?

1 How long have you been a hit man?	Why?
2 In case he asks.	Fifteen years, although I prefer the term "assassin."
3 You get benefits?	No.
4 Paid sick leave?	You tell me to start a union, I'm blowing your head off.  Quit stalling and get out of the cab.

1 Max?	Let her go.

1 What're you thinking, Jerry?	Water mains usually go in the winter.  It's August 1st.
2 Tell you what.  Reminds me of life in the Delta.	Mississippi?
3 Mekong, my friend, Mekong.	You know, Flip, Vietnam War was fought because of a bet Howard Hughes lost to Aristotle Onasis.
4 Sure.  And the two of 'em used my legs for a wishbone.  Nearly snapped me in half.	I gotta go, Flip.  Thanks.

1 I bit the bastard's nose off.	You bit someone's nose off?
2 Yes!  Don't let's get into this thing where I have to repeat myself!

1 Lucky guess... Um, I'd feel a lot less naked if we could get outta here.	Don't tell me you're naked back there.
2 Figure of speech.  Could we go?

1 So I'm a little jumpy.  Who wouldn't be?	You're certifiable.
2 You wouldn't be sitting here if you didn't halfway believe me.	Believe you about what?

1 Was that who I thought it was?	Uh huh.
2 Has this happened to you before?	Never, but I've been practicing.
3 Who are you, Jerry?	Just a guy trying to put out a fire.

1 You're wrong.  Since I met you, I don't dream about holes anymore.	Holes?  I don't know what you're talking about.
2 Yesterday you were wondering about the wall.  How it was possible.	Now's not really the time to get into this --
3 It's Geronimo.  Love. It lets you see things.  It gives you insight. I've loved you since the first time I saw you.

1 How do you really know there's gold in Fort Knox?  Just because they say so?  We should go to Tennessee and demand to see it.	You go.  Send me a postcard.

1 Blue moon...	You saw me standing alone ...

1 I love you, too.	Now she tells me.

1 So he thinks NASA is plotting to kill the President?	You already asked me that.  Why do you insist on making me repeat myself?
2 And you have no idea where he lives?	You've asked me that one three times.
3 Here's a fresh one.  Why you? Your colleague Mr. Wilson says Jerry won't speak to anyone else. That seems oddly possessive behavior to me.	I'm sorry.  What was the question again?
4 <u>Why you</u>?	Honestly?  I think he has a crush on me.
5 A charming term.  Now, <u>why him</u>?	Excuse me?
6 Jerry's visits to your office. Why do you tolerate them?  Why him?	A year ago I was leaving work late one night.  Two guys tried to mug me.  It was horrible.  Jerry came out of nowhere.  To my rescue. Then he started coming to see me.  Could've been a storybook if he wasn't crazy.  At first I did my beat to avoid him.  But there's something inside Jerry and...  Jerry made me see it.  <u>He made me</u> <u>see him</u>.  That make sense?

1 Where'd you get it?	You do recognize it then?
2 It was my father's.  Kept it in his wallet.  He was murdered --	I know the story.  A federal judge.  He denied a man in prison an appeal for a new trial.
3 Not a man.  Ezekiel Walters.	Walters had nothing to do with your father's murder.
4 You sound so sure.

1 I've been given a cease and desist on all matters relating to Jerry Fletcher.  We're not to discuss him with the press, the N.Y.P.D., anyone.  Building police are to arrest him on sight and we're to report any attempt he makes to contact you.	This doesn't make sense.
2 It makes perfect sense.  Field work is not our oeuvre.	I don't like it.  Something's wrong.
3 Dr. Jonas thought you might be inclined not to cooperate.  Why is that?	We don't know who Jonas is.  We don't know who it is we're cooperating with.
4 I've had a lot of credentials flashed in my face, Liza.  What I saw yesterday, I know not to ask questions.  We're out.  Shut off. Terminated.  <u>Understood</u>?	-- Understood.

1 Do you believe me?	Yeah, I do.
2 I want to believe you, too.	What do you mean?

1 Dr. Arroway --	Michael Kitz, National Security Advisor.
2 Dr. Arroway, let me first say --

1 Mathematics is the only truly universal language, Senator.  We think this may be a beacon -- an announcement to get our attention.	If it's attention you want I'd say you've got it.  Just one thing:  Why Vega? Everyone's looked at Vega for years with no results, and now, yesterday, they start broadcasting primes. Why?
2 It's hardly yesterday; the signal's been traveling for over twenty-six years.  As for why...  I'm hoping your own expertise in decryption algorithms will help us find out -- to see if there's another message buried deeper in the signal.

1 ... Two years is still a hell of a long time -- and as far as we can tell there aren't any provisions in the machine design for storing food, water, even air...	... I can't believe they wouldn't take something as basic as our biological needs into account...

1 What...	In ancient times when parchment was in short supply people would write over old writing... it was called a palimpsest.
2 A third layer.

1 You've only searched -- what is it, sixteen hundred stars without a peep?  Try not to take it too personally.	Thank you, Mr. Sensitive.  I'm coming at this wrong... missing something... something...

1 Please answer the question, Doctor.	Is it possible.  Yes.  But --
2 Thank you, Doctor.  Now --	-- but I don't believe it to be the truth.

1 ... life is unspeakably rare.  So whenever we do find another civilization, especially one that's... struggling... We send a message.  Sometimes we can offer help.  Sometimes we can't.  But we always try.  Life is simply too precious not to.	Can you help us?

1 A sunrise and a sunset every forty- five minutes.	It's so... small.
2 Poor, tired, spinning girl... How we feasted on her.  And now that we've had our fill and given her a giant dose of the clap... we're pulling out.  That's Paris, where my daughter was born.  Moscow, where gangsters rule the night and I gave up smoking.  So many battles, so many lives... all that sturm, and drang.  As if it never happened.  If it weren't for a few power grids, you wouldn't know we existed.

1 I read your paper on ETI's.  It's brilliant.	Keep it down, okay?  Drumlin thinks I'm enough of a flake as it is.  Look -- everyone here has their little fetishes.  Caven goes to topless bars, Vernon's got his carnivorous plants... mine just happens to be extraterrestrial intelligence.
2 What a coincidence.  It happens to be my fetish too.

1 I agree with Mr. Rank that there are unavoidable religious implications here -- but I don't think it justifies taking an alarmist position.  Dr. Arroway is right -- their chosen means of communication was a scientific one, and a scientific approach is probably appropriate, at least until the theological dimensions of the problem become more apparent.	And where exactly does that put your position...?
2 I'd have to say I don't know enough to have one yet.  For the moment I don't believe the two approaches have to be mutually exclusive.

1 I read your book.	Really.
2 Losing Faith:  The Search For Meaning In the Age of Reason. Catchy.	What'd you think?
3 I'm more interested in the story behind the story... How a young man goes from living on the streets of South Boston to being the best- selling media figure rubbing elbows with the President.	I won't deny I was ambitious.  When I had my... experience... I wanted to tell my story to as many people as possible.  I'm the first to admit that process included making some compromises.  You didn't answer my question.
4 I thought it was well-written. Heart-felt.  And a little bit naive... But that's just the enemy's perspective.	I don't consider you the enemy, Ellie.  I'm not 'out to get' technology.  I only ask the question:  Does it have to have all the answers?  I look out there and I see so much emptiness... People are so starved for meaning, and it's something they just don't seem to be getting from science.
5 Did you ever stop to think that maybe that isn't science's fault, but meaning's?	I don't follow.
6 Maybe the reason people are having trouble finding meaning isn't because science has obscured it... maybe it's just revealed it isn't there.

1 Hi.	Hi.
2 I'm assuming you read my deposition.	It was quite a page turner.
3 Pretty ironic, huh?  I had to go all the way to the center of the galaxy... Just to find you.

1 You don't take another man's place, boy.	It wasn't his fault. Nobody said anything about seats. We --

1 You think life is some kind of ocean voyage and you start out with buntin' and hollerin' and high hopes, but the damn ship goes down before you ever reach the other side. Luke?	Here, Mom.
2 What went wrong?	Nothin'. Ever'thing's cool's can be.
3 No.	Tried to live always just as free and aboveboard as you been, and well, they ain't that much elbow room.

1 Then how come it ain't done yet?	I don't know, Boss.
2 You don't know!

1 Here, Captain.	Maliciously destroyin' municipal property while under the influence. What was that?
2 Cuttin' the heads off parkin' meters, Captain.	Well, we ain't never had one of them. Where'd you think that was gonna get you?
3 I guess you could say I wasn't thinkin', Captain.	Says here you done real good in the war: Silver Star, Bronze Star, couple Purple Hearts. Sergeant! Little time in stockades. Come out the same way you went in: Buck Private.
4 That's right, Captain. Just passin' the time.	Well, you got yourself some time now. Two years. Hell, that ain't much, we got coupla men here doin' twenty spots. We got one who's got all of it. We got all kinds and you gonna fit in real good. Course in case you git rabbit in your blood and decide to take off fer home, you git a bonus a some time and couple leg chains to keep you slowed down a little -- fer your own good. You'll learn the rules. It's all up to you. I can be a good guy or I can be one mean son-of-a-bitch, it's up to you.

1 Newmeat looks like a poker player, Drag.	Wouldn't surprise me none.  Wicker Man says you got a hundred- twenny and some change in the Captain's safe and you got your five dollars pocket money... That'll buy you a whole fistfull of cards. You in or out?

1 Lemme see it!	Get away!

1 Course not. He ain't in the box 'cause a the joke played on him. He's there 'cause he back sassed a Free Man. They got their rules and we ain't got nothing to do with that. Woulda probably happened to him sooner or later, to a complainer like him. He's gotta learn the rules same as anybody else.	Yeah, those poor old guards need all the help they can get.
2 You tryin' to say somethin'?

1 They don't know iff'n to smile, spit or swallow.	They ain't never seen a bull gang before.

1 Dragline gives out the names here. You'll get yours when he figures you out.	Maybe we oughta call you No-Ears. You don't listen much, do you, boy?

1 A bunch. Must be halfa dozen Newmeat.	No more than five. For a cold drink.
2 Bet! Babalugats, bet here!

1 Back a buck.	Kick a buck.

1 I don't see no sign of guts in you.	No. No chains either.
2 You ain't man enough to wear them!	But you're dog enough. Maybe they'll let you sleep outside the box near your master.
3 Big deal paper hanger! Hell, anyone who can write can pass fifty-sixty dollar checks. Like breakin' open a piggy bank.	You've been having bad luck with masters, haven't you? Your last one left you when the cops came... and now Luke. You should complain to the S.P.C.A.
4 You phony creep!

1 Cellulite.  What do you say I blindfold you and take you to the gym.  Aerobics with housewives...	Andy?

1 It's almost six.  And guess what? Hall likes me bathed and shaved.	Stop acting like a silly little fag!

1 The first two murders.	What first two murders.  We don't know about them here, do we?
2 He told me he had done two others just like it.	When was that?
3 When he was seventeen.	And you believed him when he told you he had done that.
4 Yes.  I believed him.

1 Hi.  It's your worst student, Peter Foley -- how do you grade me now, Doctor?	Who was the man in the basement?
2 You like that action?  Didn't that cop on TV look <u>solemn</u>?  The guy in the basement doesn't matter, anyway, just another lonely heart.	Where are you, Peter?
3 <u>You</u> thought I was going to do Ted Bundy next, so you sent your partner...

1 I want to tell you it's a great honor to meet you and talk to you.	You don't admire me.  No police admire me.  I got one of you killed.  Why don't you say right out what you're here for?
2 <u>You</u> called <u>us</u>, Doctor Hudson.	Yes, I did.  Poor impulse control. The accounts of the firs two murders made it so clear they were the work of the same man, but you kept announcing they were unrelated.  You'll never catch him that way.

1 She probably let him in the door without a thought.  Where are their mothers?!  Where are the mothers that are supposed to teach them to be wary and to tough and not afraid to fight?	Look at the sign.  'Hell'?  In the Festival of Love?  You make any sense in that?

1 Helen, hang up, let Ruben get on with his work...	What's that music.  It's Abba.  I can hear it.  It's Abba.

1 I am not going to talk about it. How do you <u>know</u> it was Andy if the head was gone?  Where is the head? Are you looking for it?  Oh, God, why him?  Because of me.  I can't talk about it.  I write about things like this, stuff it all in books and bury it in libraries. This is the first person close to me who's ever died.  And it's because of me.  This monster killed him because I loved him.	I've got to go.  I've <u>got</u> to go.

1 I know 'Halloran.'  What's the rest of it?	MaryJane.  We call her M.J.
2 MaryJane.  You think that logic and police procedure, order and science and method will hold back the horrors of a world gone mad and the sickness of the night.  I did once. But you know how he'll get caught? He'll have an accident, or some cop will get lucky.  You can't catch him by being intelligent and working hard.  Or the worst:  there are dozens of women slaughtered in the most horrible way, month after month.  The news stories grow more grotesque and bizarre and in the city people lock their doors and windows, and hurry home before dark.  And then, one day, there are no more.  What happened?  Did he just stop?  Get tired and disgusted and decide not to kill any more? Did he kill himself?  Did he die in an auto accident?  Or a fight.  Or get sick and die?  It's like the murderer walked off the edge of the earth.  And you never know.  But you keep asking yourself -- when you read about a new murder -- is he back?

1 Yes.	Is there a phone booth there?
2 They all have one...	Go and look for a note.

1 Whatever it is, I'm gonna find out and sooner is a hell of lot better than later.	Well, there's something missing in there.  There was something around her neck when I came in there, but it's gone now.
2 Who came in after you?	Lieutenant  Quinn.

1 You're good enough you'll never have to kill anyone.  I joined the cops to save lives, not waste them.	You know, M.J., when I watch you shoot, I realize I've got a little problem with my stance... could you just move over here and critique my legs?

1 Ruben, my God, I ought to put you on report.	You're right.  I can't stand that bastard.  Sorry.  This is something new.  Not the same guy, that's for sure.
2 Yeah, everything's different.

1 We're gonna have a bunch of clapped out old hippies blissing on the Grateful Dead!  Sleeping in the park, smoking dope and sticking tulips up their ass.	Good.

1 The prowler in Hudson's apartment turns out to have a meeting with a suspect...	You got a suspect...
2 How'd you get in on the deal?	I'm gonna drop charges on the break-and-enter at Hudson's...
3 You have no authority to make a deal like that.  That' s for the D.A...	Or the F.B.I.?
4 Saks.  If he knew you did that! They're all asking me, 'what is she doing,' as it is.	Give me Ruben back...
5 Nikko?

1 See, now you've annoyed her.  You know she doesn't like you to touch me.  Does she, widdle wee fing!  Wuhve you so much!  Did you feed her?	Yes, I fed her.  If she says she's hungry, she's lying to you.  Again.
2 She doesn't lie!  You sure you fed her?	She lies all the time.  Why would I say I fed her if I didn't?
3 That's what I don't know.  Why would you lie?  That's the problem... I can't understand why anyone would lie.

1 Renata tells me you're going to rent a car.	I can't sit on this balcony forever. I'm beginning to feel like a potted plant.
2 How can you drive? James... your legs. You can Barely walk.	Is the traffic heavier now? There seem to be three times as many cars as there were before the accident.
3 I've never really noticed. Is Renata going with you?	I thought she might come along. Handling a car again might be more tiring than I imagine.
4 I'm amazed that she'll let you drive her.	You're not envious?
5 Maybe I am a little.  James, I've got to leave for the office. Are you going to be all right?

1 You haven't told me where we're going.	Haven't I? To the airport, if you could.

1 What is it?	A complimentary ticket for a special stunt-driving exhibition. Definitely not part of the big auto show. There's a map in the packet and a note requesting you be discrete about the location.
2 Really? What kind of exhibition is it?	I suspect it involves reenactments of famous car crashes. You know, Jayne Mansfield, James Dean, Albert Camus...
3 You're kidding.	Serious. But you'll have to take your new friend, the female crash-test dummy. She dropped it off for you.
4 You're not jealous, are you? You have to understand... Helen and I had this strange, intense... experience together.

1 Hello, Letitia. I'm Dr. Emlee, and I have some questions to ask you...	I did this already.
2 It's hospital policy...

1 But what I really can't believe is that I'm starting to actually miss work.	Have you been in contact with the principal about your job?
2 I thought about calling, but I want to wait until I know when I'll be out.	Then, you should call.
3 What?	I think it's about that time, Letty. The charges against you have been dropped, the drugs have evened out and you seem to be dealing with your life quite well.
4 Are you saying I'm through with therapy?

1 You know what, Ruthie? I better get back to my class, OK?	And the party?
2 Yeah, it'll be fun.

1 What's all the dreck?	Sage, rosemary...  Les Herbes.
2 It'll be fine.	No, no. They've got to be Puglia olives, packed in a light brine with a flavor that doesn't overpower the palate.

1 How wonderful, darling.  What does that mean for you?	I'll be running it three days a week, and...
2 Will you get time off to do that?	Not now, but maybe later, if they like the program.

1 I'll see you soon.	Tomorrow?
2 As soon as Dr. Emlee says.

1 Honestly, Letty.	A deal's a deal.

1 Do you mind if I call you Letitia?	Letty.
2 First off, Letty, can you tell me where you are?	I answered these questions last night.
3 I know this can be a real drag, but the attending physician on day shift is required to do his own prelim exam when a patient is admitted during the night.

1 But you're checking it out.	I've already checked it out 17 times.

1 A daisy for the lady.	The lady knows this is a dandelion.
2 A rose is a rose.

1 John and Nurse Gates are waiting for you.	Oh, right.     I'm ready.   How do I look?
2 Great. I came to tell you to break a leg, and to give you this for good luck.

1 It's TV heaven.	I was tired of watching what everyone else wants to watch. Now we can watch two shows at once.
2 Let's try out the bed.

1 Sounds good. Oh, and Letty?	Yeah?
2 You've got one hell of a great body.

1 Hey, Letty. Mrs. Mayer.	I got worried. Are you OK?

1 I guess we need to talk.	I guess so.
2 It's hard to know where to start.

1 I guess I should go now.	You should go.

1 But what about that math project?	Paul, I just can't go. Is that OK with you or am I committing some horrible crime?
2 Forget I asked.	I'm sorry.  I'm just...I'm so tired lately.
3 Maybe you ought to see a doctor.	No, it's not like that.

1 No, you've done a perfect job.	So, what do you say, Let?

1 The Superintendent was just getting ready to leave.	I do apologize.    A student had a crisis.

1 You want the tapes for yourself.     You're going to sell them.	I'm going to retire with a shit-load of money. Find me a small country that doesn't have an extradition treaty with the States and live the good life.
2 You didn't have to kill Sophie.	Yes I did.    Lose ends are messy.
3 What about me? Aren't I a loose end?	When this is over you can say whatever the hell you want. I'll be long gone. Besides, who's going to believe you? You're just a two-bit crook.
4 And you're a dirty cop. At least I don't pretend to be something different than what I am.

1 Yes. We went to the address we were given and had to tie up the owner of the house who turns out to be some Mafia guy.	You're there now?
2 Oui.	You're calling me on your cell phone, right?
3 No.	You're calling me on is phone?
4 Oui.	My number's going to show up on his bill!
5 Should I call you back?

1 I understand Bobby Beans came to see you today.	Yeah. Seems Maranzano wants to talk about buying the Merchant Street warehouse.
2 And?	And nothing.     He's just feeling us out.
3 He's trying to get a foot hold in our territory.	He sticks his toes in the water again, we'll cut 'em off.
4 Business must be good if he can afford to buy up useless property.	I heard this quarter his profits are gonna be supernumerary.

1 This plane will take you to Canada. From there you can fly back to Paris.	Thank you.
2 You have something for me?

1 Get that, will you?	Why do I always have to answer the phone?
2 Because you're the closest.	I'm not any closer than you are.

1 Cut his pants up the leg to the groin.	And be careful when you get near the top. Zero has a very long one.

1 Fuck you! You know I'd never go along with something like this.	Do I?
2 This ain't about that and you know it. This is about you never forgiving me for leaving the crew.

1 What's the big deal? It's not like I was on guard duty or something.	You didn't think it was little suspicious that someone you only knew for a few hours wanted to sleep with you?
2 No.   Chicks dig me.

1 What?	Can I trust you, Sami?
2 Hey, who warned you that they were coming up to the room?	If they had taken us by surprise they would have gotten the tapes back. That would have left us with nothing.
3 No, that would have left me with nothing because all of you would be dead.	You haven't answered my question.
4 Does it really matter what I say?	I'm leaving you with my friends. I'm trusting you to do the right thing today.
5 I will.	You better.

1 What'd I tell you? Huh, Vinny? What'd I tell you when you came to me for money? Didn't I ask you not to do it? Did I not say that?  What'd I say to him?	You said don't do it, boss.
2 That's right. I said don't do it. Did you listen to me? No. You wanted the money. So, I lent you twenty large. Now it's been three weeks and you ain't paid a dime. What do you think that makes me look like on the street? I don't do something to you and everyone will think they can skate.

1 They don't have a wine list.	Oh, then we will have the house wine.

1 Maybe I'm missing the obvious, but why aren't we leaving town? Any place has to be safer for us than Chicago.	It doesn't matter where we go. Between Zammito and the FBI they'll find us. We have to end this here.

1 Going somewhere?	Oh, Marcel! I thought you were somebody else. If I knew it was you I would have never run.

1 How's my brother?	He's over at St. James. They had to put two pins in his arm.
2 I said a clean break.

1 He speaks about himself in the third person?	Feel free to correct him if you want.

1 Algeria.	And you don't speak French?
2 Well, you know, not all Algerians speak French. It's a matter of what school you went too. Me I never really --	-- Zero isn't interested in your life story.  Who gets killed?

1 You like shoes?	No, I like the bag. It would be good for the job tonight.
2 It belongs to Vincent Bastaldi. He left it last time he was here. I'm sure he wouldn't mind if you used it.

1 Jesus, Frankie, I'm your brother!	That's why we're only breaking one arm.

1 Do you think you are a real master?	Like most things, I am nothing. It's the same for this sword.  All of it is simply a state of mind.
2 Stop talking like a monk!  Just fight!	Then tell me where Jade Fox is.
3 On guard!	Real sharpness comes without effort.

1 I'm tired now.	Go to bed then.  Miss has grown up, and is getting married soon.  God knows what the future will bring.
2 It will be just the same.  Enough! I'm tired.	Autumn is coming.  I'll shut the windows for you.

1 Here you must be in proper attire.	I'm just borrowing some clean clothes.  I'm not staying.
2 I'll give them to you.	I was just passing by and wondered how you were.

1 You shouldn't have come.	With all the traffic on your rooftop these days... it took me a while to get in here.  I can't wait any longer.  I was wrong to let you go.  Come back with me.  You'll be happy in the desert.  You'll be free there.

1 Go.	Jen...
2 Don't ever come back.

1 You think Jade Fox will show up?	She's out there, but I doubt she'll show herself.  We'll keep our eyes open.  Sooner or later, she'll come for the girl.

1 Maybe the murderer and the thief are one and the same.	I doubt it.  This thief... it very unusual...

1 And you're gonna tell me who.	Who ever made that.

1 And I say I'm dead... and I move.	No further.  I'm serious.

1 I mean, I've done what I came to do.  It shouldn't hurt this much. But it will pass...	Right.  You sure I can't just take you to the emergency ward?

1 My mom works over there.  I'm waiting for her, but she's probably with him, right now.	Who?
2 Mister Funboy.	Mister Funboy lives there?
3 He has a room, upstairs.  I don't like him very much.

1 Chili dog for breakfast... it's original.	Mom tried to cook.
2 Oh.

1 Who gives a fuck!  I'm a businessman.  You gonna do me, then do me and shut you're face!	You don't even remember...
2 I never forget anything, dickhead. That building was a sweep-and- clear; the bitch was a nuisance with her goddamned petition.  It got a little rowdy... end of story.	Rowdy.  Let me fill in some gaps for you.

1 No, wait, no WAIT, that's too much, man, that's like overkill, nobody can take that much, you're wasting it -- !	Your pain ends now.

1 Blow yourself, bigmouth.	Whoa, hey, whoa.  Business.

1 I've got him if you want him.	No shooting.
2 Move in, guys.

1 Annette, how long have we known each other?	Forever.
2 Now it's my job to look out for you. You're like a kid sister to me. Do I look like some kind of gossip queen?

1 About what?	About what you said today in the stable. I'm not a happy person.
2 I never said that.	You implied it.
3 Look, I didn't mean to give you a hard time.	No, it's okay. I mean I look at you with all your morals and values and well, YOU seem to be happy in your choices. I envy you. No bullshit.
4 Thank you.	Seriously, you're amazing. You have everything going for you.  You're smart, you're beautiful, you're determined. You're everything I want in a girlfriend.
5 Shut up.	I wasn't kidding. I'd like to take you out.
6 Look, I'm flattered but, seriously it could never work.	Why not?
7 Because you act like a pig.

1 Well, I was just calling to tell you I was thinking about you and I miss you. I'll let you go.	Wait, don't hang up.
2 Okay?	What are you doing?
3 Reading.

1 You know what? I don't take it back.	Why are you doing this?
2 Because I'm in love with you.	I thought you said we were going to be friends.
3 I can't handle it. I can't keep my feelings bottled up like you. Can you honestly tell me that you feel nothing for me? ... Tell me!	I have feelings for you.
4 Then what's wrong? I love you Annette. It's not like you have a husband, unless your married to Jesus.	That's not fair.
5 Why can't we be together?

1 It's not you, it's me. I'm completely fucked up.	What are you saying?
2 Why aren't you understanding?	I love you.
3 I know. I wish I felt the same. Unfortunately, I feel nothing. I think it was just the conquest. Sorry, I'm completely fucked up.

1 Where did you find those?	Margarita found them while cleaning your room.
2 Those are my letters!	Don't you raise your voice at me. Go to your room, now.

1 Who is it?	It's Kathryn.

1 I'm sorry that was out of line.	I want to go home.
2 I was just kidding.	I want to go home.

1 Jesus. We've been at this for six months.	I know.
2 And you haven't made an ounce of progress.	I know.

1 Greg, is that you under the covers?	Get out of here.

1 What's wrong?	It's Sebastian. He's out of his mind.
2 What do you mean?	I think he's high on drugs. He hit me, then took off. I'm afraid to be alone. Please come over.
3 I'll be right there.

1 Jesus Christ, is she for real?	Oh yes. I've read it over and over again. This baby's the real deal. Daddy's little angel. A paradigm of chastity and virtue.
2 B.F.D. What do you plan to do? Fly to Kansas and woo little Dorothy.	It just so happens we're not in Kansas anymore. Our little angel's father has accepted the new headmaster position at Oakwood. She's staying with my aunt up in Connecticut while Daddy sells his house. Can you imagine what this would do for my reputation? Screwing the new headmaster's virginal daughter before school starts? It will be my greatest victory.
3 You don't stand a chance. Even this is out of your league.	Care to make a wager on that?
4 I'll think about it...	Oh well, duty calls. Time to add another chapter to my work of art.

1 I hate when things don't go my way. It makes me so horny.	I hate it too.

1 If your asking if I nailed her the answer is no.	She shot you down.
2 Exactly the opposite.	So what went wrong?
3 I don't know. She was lying on the bed, ready to do it, but I-- I don't, I was... I just didn't feel right about it.	You're telling me you had the chance to fuck her and you didn't. God are you a chump.
4 A momentary lapse of judgment, soon to be rectified.

1 Devastated beyond repair. I doubt she'll ever trust a man again.	Well done.

1 Don't worry, it's totally understandable. Most of the boys that matriculate at Oakwood are very upstanding gentleman, however there are the occasional bad apples.	Like your step-brother Sebastian. I can't believe they didn't expel him after what he did to the school nurse.

1 I'll do that.	It's really important.
2 I understand. Good night.

1 to a situation) Really, Mr. Reed, there isn't anything to worry about. It was only a slap --	That's exactly what I told Mr. Reed, but he insisted upon remaining home from business to talk to you, Miss Callahan.

1 You get your wish!	You know what I wished, Daddy? I wished I could be a good girl.

1 Oh, thank you, darling.	You can't open it yet. You have to put all of them under the tree until morning.

1 Did you hear the child out?	Well, it seemed to me --
2 You mean you didn't. It seems to me the least you could do. You can't just jump at conclusions that way. You're being unfair.	I'm never unfair.
3 You're shouting at me.	I'm not shouting at you, but there's no doubt in my mind that you spoil this child!

1 Hello, Amy.	Are you coming to see us. Miss Callahan?
2 No, darling, I hadn't intended to.	I live right here.
3 Maybe I'll drop in and see your Mommy.

1 I'm sorry. Daddy and Mommy are a little upset.	You're upset about me -- I made you fight --I hate for you to fight.

1 What'd you get for Christmas?	I don't know yet.
2 My goodness, don't you open your presents until Christmas morning?	No.
3 We open ours on Christmas Eve. That's considered proper.	Well, I guess we're not a very proper family.

1 So beautiful, Irena. So beautiful.	You wanted to share this moment with me.
2 It stands so still.	Because it knows it can move with the swiftness of strong wind.
3 I can sea its breath in the cold.	It's a warm breath -- warm and strong  warmed by the sunlight that shone on the deer's back in the hot summer; sweet with leaves and mosses.
4 May I pet the deer?	It is wildness and freedom. No one can touch it.
5 I want to touch it.

1 You're going to be busy all day long, Edward.	I do suppose so. But if you were there yesterday, guess you can get there today.
2 That means I can go alone?

1 I like stories.	Then I'll tell you a story  a lovely story. Do you know the story of Rapunzel?
2 Mommy read it to ne.	Do you know the story of "The Headless Horseman?"

1 My daughter, Barbara, died when she was six. That was long ago. You're only the woman who keeps care of me. I know you.	Look at me.

1 On the dark nights  on the stormy nights -- you can hear him. He passes like the wind; The flapping and fluttering of his great cloak beating like gaunt wings. The thunder of his horse's hooves is loud, loud and louder, beating hard, beating strong on the frozen ground as he comes riding, riding, riding.	Little miss, you can't stay here. You've got to come with me.

1 Amy looks happy  seems almost as if she were playing with another child; like somebody else were running with her and playing.	I like to see her happy.
2 So do I, Mr. Reed.

1 No way is that the same chick. The other one was a dog.	Jennifer gave her a make-over.
2 Looks like a helluva lot more than a make-over. Was there surgery involved?

1 How's the rest of your health?	Good. Except for PMS.

1 Or if there's a full moon.	Or if your boyfriend's an asshole.

1 I thought you were going to stop wearing your glasses.	My vision got worse again.

1 Charming Carlton.	It is so hot in here.

1 You're delusional. Maybe you had a bad dream and bit your lip -- so you tasted blood. And the severed arm... well I don't see it and... maybe this is all in your head.	It took me an hour to clean it up. That was not in my head!
2 Maybe the blood was from your period like before.	I haven't gotten it yet.
3 Frida, listen to yourself. If I said I was a werewolf, would you believe me?	I don't know. You have to take Sammy. He's afraid of me.

1 Peter knows something.	Well if he does, he didn't give you away. He must really like you.

1 You're kidding, really?	No, I'm serious. How about we have dinner and I tell you about it?

1 OUCH that stings! Damn, what am I going to do with my back like this?	Worried about what all your girlfriends might think?
2 Frida, you know you're it for me.	Yeah right... You better go.

1 I can't read any more crap. These women are all victims.	Yes, that's what we're looking for.
2 I think we should do something with strong female characters...	I'll make a note of that. Put the coverage on my desk.

1 I've read scripts about detectives, but never met one. Must be wild.	Sometimes it's frustrating. Like this Gregory Jameson case. We don't even know what killed him. I'm putting together little details to see if we're missing something.
2 Like what?	You know how moms always tell you to wear clean underwear in case you're in an accident? Well this guy wasn't wearing any underwear.
3 A lot of people don't wear underwear.	Yeah but a guy hung like a horse would need briefs to keep things in line.

1 Everything okay?	A man killed in Central Park.

1 Is it that funny?	No, it's just... no one's ever said that. And I thought if someone did ever say it, I'd have to say it first and then they'd sort of say "I love you too" cause they felt they had to after I'd said it.
2 Is that how you feel?	Like I had to say it? No, I wanted to say it.
3 You didn't say it.	I love you too.

1 Be careful!	Can't you bite me and then I'll be like you?
2 No. It doesn't work that way. Men can't get PMS. Unfortunately.	I'm staying here with you tonight. There's no getting rid of me.

1 A kiss? Did you have sex with him?	No, I said it was our first date.

1 It's for you. Frida.	Tell her I'm eating.

1 I didn't trust her. All that blood on the sheets. She may look sweet, but she could be a wolf in sheep's clothing. Something's weird.	That dude was torn limb from limb. No way a woman like that could have done it. You never seen blood on a chick's sheets from her period?
2 Hell no, I'm not into that shit. The sight of blood makes me sick.	Oh, so you decide to be a cop? Seriously? You don't have sex with a woman cause she's on the rag?
3 No man. Blood is not a turn on. You sure let that Frida off the hook. You weren't even going to take the sheets. If I didn't know better, I'd think you liked her.	I can tell she's not a killer. You just don't like her cause you have a hang up about menstruation.
4 Nah, man, I'm just saying, you should never date a woman who was the last one to see a guy alive.

1 Spencer's the key here. Frida is in no way associated with him. And her blood hasn't matched with any of the killings.	It's a bit farfetched that Mark would rip guys to shreds just outta jealousy. This makes no sense.
2 It's like some fucking monster dropped out of the sky and killed these dudes.	Like a vampire or some shit?

1 All the same entry wounds.  It's definitely him.  She lives...  lived here.  A prostitute.	The other one?
2 His wife.	Jesus.  Small world.  Where's the photographer?
3 No one available.

1 Was that for real down there?	I'm afraid so.

1 Dammit!	Sorry, sir.
2 Dont ever sneak up on me like that! Who are you?	Patricia Crenshaw.

1 People...  after me.	Who?
2 I don't know who they are.	Why are they after you?
3 Don't know that either.	Don't know much, do you?

1 Such a joker!  Like your father.	No.  Have a look.

1 What does she say?  The woman.	Asks my name.  Over and over.  Just like a broken record.  Only thing is, I can't answer.  I've no idea what my name <u>is</u>.
2 Your name is John White.	That's what people keep telling me.

1 What are you doing?	I have to go...
2 You can't go yet.  We've got so much to talk about...

1 You understand what you'll be doing?	Yeah... You just want me to wave, right?
2 Wave from the door... go down the stairs... get into the limo...	`Cause you know I can do other stuff. I mean,  if you wanted me to talk or...
3 Don't say a .	Right.

1 I'm not certain about...	Oh, sure.  Remember the convention speech?

1 What do you think you're doing?!	You mean the press conference?  I have a couple of ideas I wanted to share with the country.
2 Share...

1 Look, everything can be handled.  We'll just find a way to handle it.	Like how?
2 Well, start by going on television and saying that he's had a mild stroke...	Mild stroke?
3 Yes - - and that he ought to be up and around sometime soon.	Up and around?  Soon?
4 Soon.

1 Uh, let me get back to you...	You scheduled a whole day with the First Lady?
2 It's a homeless shelter.	Oh.  Excuse me.
3 It's gonna be great.  'Caring about his wife.'  'Spending time on her favorite issue...'	I don't want him caring about his wife! What about the Vice President!
4 Remember that First Liberty stuff we almost got nailed on?

1 So you want to go swimming?	Dave -- I'm working.
2 Oh yeah... Me, too.  You want to get dinner later?	I was gonna do something with Joan.
3 Oh. Okay.  I'll catch ya tomorrow then.

1 It's actually kind of serious, Dave. I'm afraid the President's not in very good shape.	Oh my gosh...

1 Fine.	Fine.

1 This is from the people of Burundi...	Oh... Thanks.
2 And these are a gift from the King of To go.

1 Your government needs your help.	What?
2 On occasion for security purposes, to double for the President at the Secret Service hires someone public functions and exposed situations.

1 Who?	The Vice-President...
2 Oh... right...  You know, ever since the stroke...

1 ... How could I what?	Oh, come on, Bill.  Don't patronize me.   I'm not one of your little...  Turn around.  I'm talking to you!... Turnaround!

1 Just souvenirs.  Towels and stuff.	You1re leaving, too?
2 I never wanted to hurt anybody.  In fact... I even thought I was helping.

1 That's a secret.	You have a lot of secrets.
2 I guess.

1 Hi.	Hi.
2 ) Thought I needed a little change.  You like it?	It's nice.

1 Please...senor...destroy me...one bullet...please.	Maybe. We'll have a little talk first. Then....maybe...I can help you out. String him up.

1 Are you alright, Doc? You look... you look real bad.	I have looked bad for four years. Everyone in the world has looked bad for four years. Thank God looks don't matter as much as they once did.

1 The man I was with...until today... believed that praying was for blind men who couldn't see the truth.	How we gonna break the curse without a prayer or two.
2 Curse?	What is it if it ain't a curse?
3 It's a disease. It's a...a bug...a parasite that infects the brain.	That sounds like a curse to me.
4 We thought we were escaping here. We thought we'd found an uninhabited island. Christ! This place is a worse nightmare than anything I've seen yet!	I'm sure that's true, miss. And that's why we're doin' what we're doin'. What's happenin' underground here is just what Lucifer planned for this sinful race o' man. But we're gonna beat Lucifer. We're gonna put an end to what's happenin' here.
5 Oh, what did I run into? A bunch o' Jesus nuts? Religiosos? Prayer won't stop a bullet from one of those storm troopers and prayer won't keep one of those monsters from eatin' your liver for lunch.	That's why we didn't use prayers on this here white coat 'til after he was destroyed. We ready to fight when we have to. And we gotta fight now.
6 Look. I BEEN fightin', mister. I been fightin' for what feels like a hundred years and I'm finished. I don't need religion. I don't need prayers. I need a couple guns and a couple hands. We can sail on outa here. Find another island where there ain't so much....traffic.	You think you can find your boat? There's a thousand little inlets and backwaters all through here. You remember all the ways you turned to get where you are now? You leave yourself a trail?

1 What'dya tell that soldier, soldier? You tell him we was rebels?	He's my contact for Chrissake! There's two crates. Can you get me into the hospital?

1 TONY....TONY....	PULL IN! GET THE OTHERS.

1 Toby...thank God...wait here. I gotta find out what's goin' on.	Hey. Slow down. What is it?
2 Some of Rhodes' men. At the door.	That bastard. I didn't think he'd make his move so fast.
3 It's because of me.	Oh, bullshit, Mary. It's because Rhodes is a prick.
4 I want you to leave. Then maybe...	We're both gonna leave. Leave the island. I've been talkin' to Tricks. We think we can smuggle out one of those inflatable rafts. They're crated up real small. They've got air canisters. There's food inside. Even a little motor.
5 I am not...a guerilla fighter, Toby. I'm not a pioneer. I'm not...I'm not strong that way. I need...	Need what? Civilised order like we have down here? Christ!
6 I can work here. Maybe my work can help...help everyone. I can do more good with access to this equipment than I can off in some wasteland.	For the good of mankind. That's what every monster-maker says.

1 Well, I'd better find Patsy.  Say hello to Mutt for me.	Will do.

1 I feel like I've never been alive.  For years I've been risking nothing.  I have no idea what I am or what I want to do! Neil, you know you want to act.  Knox wants Chris.	Needs Chris!  Must have Chris!
2 Meeks, you're the brain here.  What do the dead poets say about somebody like me?

1 Well...	Oh come on, Pitts...

1 It's such a strange name!  Won't you tell us what it means?	I told you, that's a secret.
2 Isn't he precious?

1 Who else was involved in this?	No one, sir.  It was just me.  I did the proofing so I inserted my article in place of Rob Crane's.
2 Mr. Dalton, if you think you're the first to try to get thrown out of this school, think again.  Others have had similar actions and they have failed just as surely as you will fail.  Bend over and grab your shins.

1 Charlie...	It's Nuwanda.
2 Nuwanda, what is going on?	Nothing, unless you object to having girls here.

1 Oh Chet, that feels fabulous,	It does?  What?
2 You know,

1 carpe breastum.  Seize the breast.	Huh?

1 Gather ye rosebuds while ye may.  The Latin term for that sentiment is "Carpe Diem." Anyone know what that means?	Carpe Diem... seize the day.
2 Very good, Mr._?	Meeks.
3 Seize the day while you're young, see that you make use of your time.  Why does the poet write these lines?

1 Come on boys, don't be shy.	I have something.

1 All right!  What'd she say?	I don't know.

1 If you have built castles in the air, your work need not be lost.  That is where they should be.  Now put foundations under them.	God, I want to do everything!  I'm going to explode.

1 Look at this.	What is it?
2 The god of the cave.

1 By the way, there's a meeting this afternoon.  You coming?	I guess.

1 You the Captain?	Yes.
2 How do we get out of here?	We have to make it to the third deck...

1 Right here...middle of nowhere...	And where is our point of arrival?

1 Now, where's Mulligan? Where's Vivo?	I told you...

1 Hey! Hey! Where are you going?	...there's got to be a way to access out back there...

1 So how do you get from the Bronx to the South China sea?	You quit high school, lie about your age, join the navy, and next thing you know, four years are up and you need a way to make a living...

1 Where's you friend?	He's not coming...

1 I think he knows that Joey.	Good! So maybe he also know where the hell am I going to get the parts I need...

1 You know what I think? I think our luck has just about run shit out...	A little to the left...
2 I think we gotta stop floating from one fucked up situation to the next...	Line it up now, nice and easy...

1 You know what my goal is? Before I die I want to make love to a woman from every country on earth.	You mean countries that are acknowledged by the UN...or like made up countires too?
2 What the hell does that mean?	Like Mamooli's country...

1 She fucked you?	She fucked me.
2 She fucked me too.	She fucked you?
3 She fucked me too.

1 Damn right!	What do you think, Sal? Jesus, you think we'd miss this?

1 Tell him, Vince!	Well... you remember Cynthia?

1 Fucking A.	Worse since she talked to who?

1 Wait! First I give you special fuck!	Elephants! Make way... I gotta get elephants!

1 'Course how could you miss, right? Twenty, maybe thirty feet. I mean, if I'd'a been where you guys were --	Psst. Vince!

1 I don't know what we've been waiting for!	I don't know! I don't know either!

1 Yeah... All the guys, we're all going huntin'. Like we did. You know? Like we always used to.	That's wonderful. I think you should... fresh air.

1 Humper's ready. Old humper's hotter'n damn hell!	There's Vince!

1 It's ahead, by the tree.	It's ahead, Vince.

1 You're one fuckin' bastard, Merle. You know that? You're one fucking bastard!	This is this, Vince. This isn't something else. This is this!
2 You know what I think? There's times I think you're a goddamn faggot!... I fixed you up a million times, Merle!  I fixed him up a million times! I don't know how many times I fixed him up... and nothin' ever happens... Zilch! Zero!... The trouble with you, Merle, no one knows what you're talking about! "This is this"? What does that mean, "this is this"? I mean is that some faggot bullshit, or is that some faggot bullshit!!! And if it isn't, what the hell is it???

1 It's Merle, Sal.	Merle? ... Merle's alive?  How do you know?
2 I saw him last night. I thought I was dreaming. I thought I was out of my mind.	Merle gave me this?
3 Yeah.	But, Nick... Hey, I mean, where would a guy like Merle get money like this?

1 What the hell was that!  What did you think? Did you think it was loaded!	You loaded it, Vince! I saw you!
2 The fuck I did!!!	The fuck you didn't!... Gimme that!

1 Mr. Murphy asked about you again at work yesterday.	He just wants me to make him cinnamon cookies like I made for you.
2 I think he wants more than your cookies.	Kimberly!
3 Mom, I hate to break this to you, but there's a whole other species out there you're neglecting.  If you've forgotten, they're called 'men'.  Sometimes referred to in more colorful language.

1 I'm not on the force anymore.	Well, you've just been taken off the bench.
2 I want to see my wife and kid.	Later.  I want Doucet first.
3 I told you.  I'm out of the cops and robbers business.  Retired twenty years ago.  I've been trained as a bus driver.  Got a whole route planned and everything.  Even nailed down the lingo - '<u>Exact change, please</u>'.	I'm going to bring this down hard. I've got an A-1 badass killer loose, an election day after tomorrow, and I'm risking everything on you. You're going to bring him in.  I don't care how.  If you do, you'll get your freedom.  An official pardon from me.  A clean slate.  A good job.  A chance to get back with your family.  If you don't want to, I'll put your ass back in the freezer so fast, you'll forget you were ever defrosted.

1 I want to stop aging.	And I want Doucet.

1 Doucet's just offed two of the jurors who put him away.  I'm rounding up the rest of them and putting them in police custody.  What's your status?	We seem to've come across a 211, sir.
2 Forget it.  Stick to the program.

1 Sir---	Shut up!  Drop it.

1 I'll inform dispatch.	There's no time.  There are civilians in there.  It's about to go down.
2 We don't know that for sure.  We'll have to wait until they move.	Well, I'm sure.  You're a cop.  I'm a cop.  Let's do what cops do.

1 You're saying you were put away for a crime you didn't commit?	'Bout the same time I busted Doucet I tried to nail this big-time dealer. I didn't have an ID, but I was close. Too close.  Gained the confidence of a badass named Dubbs.  He was going to turn me onto the big man.  He made me for a cop.  Mysteriously my fellow officers discovered ten pounds of heroin in my cruiser.
2 It doesn't make sense.  Who would want to do that to you?	Nothing makes sense when you're a cop.

1 Part of Doucet's cerebellum, a portion called the vermis is under- developed.  This area rates response to outside stimuli.  Com- pare it to that of a normal law- abiding citizen.  It could be why he kills.	Great.  My partner's Marcus Welby.
2 I'm just doing it by the book. Analyze then vaporize.  Crime's a science.  Everything's analyzed.	With all this technology you don't even have to show up for work.  Who needs cops when you've got gizmos.
3 You're just afraid to use this.  You have technophobia, Wade.  That's what you got.

1 What are you doing this for, Sanchez?	If you were set up, I want to find out who did it.

1 Bye.  Thanks.	Remember, get the seat fixed.

1 Hey, you! Watch out there -- you're scuffing my Brussels carpet -- Consarn them.	Jabez! Careful --
2 Oh --  Didn't mean to talk like that in front of a lady.  Get some wine for the Squire, Belle.

1 Make them go faster, Mr.... ?	No, Daniel -- they are not race horses. They are good old friends of mine. I call 'em Constitution and Bill of Rights, the most dependable pair for long journeys. I've got one called Missouri Compromise, too, and then there's a Supreme Court -- fine, dignified horse, though you do have to push him now and then.
2 Golly -- I'd like to see all your horses!	Maybe you can, sometime, Daniel. I'm a farmer, you know, and like to show my farm -- but the thing I'd like to show you most, you'll have to see for yourself.
3 What's that, sir?	Well -- it's high and it's wide and it goes a long way and there is a wind blowing through it and a blue roof over it -- it's the hills up here and the rivers running south and the new States growing in the West.
4 Anybody can see that.	You're wrong, Mr. Stone. There are people who live and die without e'er seeing it. They can't see the country for the money in their pockets -- And some think their state's the country, or the way they live is the country, and they're willing to split the country because of that. Well, I hope you'll meet all those, when you're grown. You'll meet the fire-eaters and the Circassian beauties -- that's part of the fair, to be sure. But if we'd had to depend on them, in a permanent way, the country would have stopped at the Allegheny mountains.
5 But it didn't stop. I know it didn't stop. Granny told me it didn't.	No, siree, it didn't. And it won't -- no matter what happens -- just as long as the folks at the fair believe in freedom and Union. So --  Giddyap, Constitution -- and let's keep going, Mr. Stone.

1 Sure does. But I'll have to sleep on it a couple of nights.	That's fair enough, Jabez. Man's got a right to mull things over. We'll drive round again, week or so.

1 Now run along, Daniel.	What a fine boy you have, Jabez. How old is he now?
2 Almost seven.  No -- no, he's not seven yet I am sure --	Well -- it seems to me -- I remember when you paid me--

1 Are they all as -- small -- as that?	Small? Oh, I see what you mean. Why, they vary.  Now a man like Daniel Webster, if I ever get hold of him, I'd have to build a special box for him and even at that, I imagine, the wing spread would be astonishing.  In your case --
2 My time isn't up yet.

1 Well -- Mr. Webster! This is a great day for me. Come on in, sir. I want you to take the seat of honor and meet all my guests!	That's just fine, Neighbor Stone -- but -- I have to be pretty careful of my seats of honor -- where I sit, I mean. You see, the whole country sort of has its eye on me, Jabez -- anybody in public life has that difficulty -- even you, Jabez. They watch us carefully, our neighbors and our enemies, and they see much more than we think they do -- and understand much more. My friends all like to think that I've got the good of mankind always at heart, and I've got to make sure that those I deal with have the good of mankind always at heart, too. Do you know what I'm talking about, Jabez?
2 What -- what's on your mind?	You, Jabez Stone -- you and a lot of poor farmers, hereabouts -- good men of the earth who are in trouble because of you. Or -- am I wrong about those contracts, Mr. Stone?
3 Contracts? -- Yes, they have contracts with me -- lots of 'em -- but -- but that's all right. Without me and my money, they wouldn't have anything.	They'd have a good neighbor, Jabez -- and that's worth much more than anything else -- much, much more!

1 Mighty good of you to come out, Squire -- sparing all this time to --  Sheriff, too -- and Schoolmaster -- mighty nice.	Ahem -- Neighbor Stone, we want--

1 I think his leg is broken.	Oh, Jabez.
2 Yep.

1 It feels fine now, Jabez.	Will you come into town with me tomorrow?
2 I'd love to.

1 Jabez -- once you said we'd never change --	I wasn't used to being big -- wasn't used to thinking in big ways. Now, I've made up my mind.

1 You must go now, Mary -- you must!	All right, Jabez ...

1 It won't be the first baby ever born in this house.  There! Made me drop a stitch!  Sit down, you make me nervous!  Lan's, that's the way a man always is. Thinks his son's the most important thing in the world.	My son! Do you really think, Ma....
2 Oh, go along with you! As if it mattered to a grandma! But p'raps you got an even chance.

1 Yep -- you can't get around that mortgage. -- I'm sorry, Jabez.	It's all right, Sheriff.
2 Wish I could really do something for you. But you know Stevens. He'll throw you off your farm tomorrow if you don't pay him tonight.	Let him try it.
3 The law is the law. Good-bye, Mary.

1 What a nice -- and kind girl --  Who is she --?	The new girl -- Jabez says; she is from over the mountain.
2 What mountain?

1 Jabez ...	Mary -- what love and trust could do for your husband, you've done. And frankly, in a very few moments, this is going to be no place for a lady.
2 Mr. Webster -- you will help him?	I'll do my best, Mary.

1 I wanted to give it all to the church.	My money? Why, Mister Stevens? What a quaint idea. Come over to the door. I want to speak to you privately. Stop throwing away that money. We mustn't let people see any softness in you, Mister Stevens.... People take advantage of softness, you know. Come out of there -- I'll give you an extension if you'll forget this stupid repentance idea.
2 That isn't it. It's ... the loneliness, Mr. Scratch ... the loneliness!	The loneliness? Lonely with all your gold, Mister Stevens? That hardly makes sense.
3 I want someone to talk to ...	You can talk to me ...
4 No, no ...  I want to talk to men ... to people in Cross Corners ...to my neighbors ...	Why don't you?
5 I can't be honest with them.	Oh, that's what you want -- well, you can be perfectly honest with Jabez Stone -- now.

1 I'm Special Agent Johnson of the FBI. This is Agent Johnson...no relation.	Dwayne Robinson, LAPD.  I'm in charge here.
2 Not any more.

1 You're very perceptive.	Hey, I read the papers, I watch 60 minutes, I say to myself, these guys are professionals, they're motivated, they're happening. They want something.  Now, personally, I don't care about your politics. Maybe you're pissed at the Camel Jockeys, maybe it's the Hebes, Northern Ireland, that's none of my business.  I figure, You're here to negotiate, am I right?
2 You're amazing.  You figured this all out already?	Hey, business is business.  You use a gun, I use a fountain pen, what's the difference?  To put it in my terms, you're here on a hostile takeover and you grab us for some greenmail but you didn't expect a poison pill was gonna be running around the building.  Hans, baby...I'm your white knight.
3 I must have missed 60 Minutes.  What are you saying?	The guy upstairs who's fucking things up?  I can give him to you.

1 The code key, please...?	It's useless to you!  There's seven safeguards on our vault, and the code key is only one of them!  You'll never get it open!

1 Hans.  Your Hans.	Put it down now.
2 That was tricky, with the accent. I bet you do a great Ed Sullivan. Why do you need the detonators, Hans? I already used the explosives.	I'm going to count to three...
3 Yeah.  Like you did with Takagi.

1 Go on.	We have a pregnant woman out there --  -- relax, she's not due for two weeks, but a marble floor isn't doing her back any good.  I'd like permission for her to more to one of the offices where there's a sofa.
2 No.  But I'll have a sofa brought out to you.  Good enough?	Good enough.  And unless you like is messy, you'd better start taking us in groups to the bathroom.
3 Yes, you're right.  It will be done.

1 Excuse me, I'm looking for --	Holly Gennero?
2 Yeah.  How'd you know?	I've spent half my life on airplanes,   * I can recognize someone who just got off one.  I'm Joe Takagi, Mr. McClane.  I have ...something to do with this company.
3 So I've heard.

1 Two.  And I'd sure like to see them swinging on the jungle gym with Al junior.	It's a date.  You buy the ice cream.

1 What's going on?	What's it look like?  We're going in.
2 Going in...are you out of your mind? There's 30 hostages in there -- for all we know --	-- all we know?  We don't know shit, Powell.  If there's hostages why hasn't anyone asked for ransom?  If there's terrorists, where's their goddamn list of demands?  All we know is that someone shot up your car, and it could be the same flake you've been talking to on the radio!
3 What about the body that fell out of the window -- ?	Who the hell knows?  Maybe he was a stockbroker who looked at the Dow Jones and opted for early retirement!

1 Aw, hey...	Come on, nobody's gonna get hurt. If they were gonna shoot, they'd shoot now.

1 Jesus Christ is coming back and he's really pissed.	Yeah, well I don't blame him.
2 You know, Sonny, I used to dope a lot, and I was into dipping?  And I did a couple bank jobs, and the Lord Jesus in his everlasting mercy saved me, you know how?

1 Let Sal come out, take a look. What hope you got?  Quit while you're ahead.  All you got is attempted robbery.	... armed robbery ...
2 Well, armed, then.  Nobody's been hurt.  Release the hostages, nobody is gonna worry over kidnapping charges, the worst you're gonna get is five years -- you can be out in a year.

1 We're all set at Kennedy.	What makes you think you'll be able to control it?
2 He's totally unstable.  He'll make a mistake.	He hasn't so far.  I'm the one who can make a mistake.  That's what scares the shit out of me.
3 Eugene, at 3:07, this became Federal.  Why don't I take it over now?

1 The gun's right on your back...	Give me the keys...

1 What?	The TV ... they want to talk to you ...

1 Mister Mulvaney?	Yeah?
2 Are you a lawyer?	No.  I had some legal training, but...
3 I want to dictate my will.  I need a notary?

1 How did you know your son was involved?	It was on the TV.
2 When was the last time you saw Sal?	Oh, a long time.  Because I kept asking my husband where the heck could Junior be?  He wasn't around here.  I thought maybe he was in prison or some place.
3 Did you know he was a homosexual?	No, not until after they killed him.
4 Did you always call him Junior.	Yeah.
5 Do you remember anything else about Sal?	No, that's all.

1 Sal, I'm sorry about this.  But we can get outta this thing.  There's a way outta this.	Are you serious?  About throwin' a body outta here if we have to?
2 Well, I stalled him for a while. When it comes the time, then we'll work it out.  Okay?	But do you mean in? ... But you just told him that if worse comes to worse...
3 I want him to think that.	But I want to know what you think.
4 We won't have to.	I'll tell you right now - that I'm ready to do it.

1 Sal?	They gotta stop sayin' that.

1 Nobody give their right name ... it's the FBI!	I just want to see all you young ladies are all all right in here.

1 Listen, we got young girls here... you could watch your language.	I speak what I feel.

1 What do you want here, Ma?  You could of watched it on TV.	My God, Sonny - you oughtta see - Alla Brooklyn is here!  On all 3 networks!
2 Mom - I got it all worked out; it's over.  The best thing is you go home.  Watch it on TV.	I talked to the FBI, I told them about you, they said if you just come outta the bank it's gonna be okay.
3 You did what?  Who did you talk to? What for?	Well, I'm only trying to get you outta this.  I told them you were in Vietnam, you always had good jobs, you were with Goldwater at the '64 convention, but you had marital problems...
4 Oh my God, mother!	I said you were never a faggot.
5 Don't talk to them anymore.  Sal and me are getting a jet, we're going to Algeria - I'll write you from there.	He was very understanding - you ought to talk to him ... Algeria?
6 We can't stay here.	Oh my God!  I don't understand.  If you needed money, why couldn't you come to me?  Everything I got is yours.  I got two hundred and maybe twenty-five in the savings.  It's yours.  You know it.

1 Morning.	<i>Morning.</i>

1 Fella could get used to a life this ordinary.	Maybe you should fuck her mom then.

1 Okay.	<i>I won't forget this, Domino. I'm sorry it turned out like this...</i>

1 <i>The driver's name was Locus Fender. We know that he was in on the heist.</i> <b> INT. ARMORED CAR -- NEXT </b> LOCUS FENDER  is behind the wheel of the armored car. His unshaven, disheveled appearance looks totally out of place in his security uniform. <b> INT. VEGAS SECURITY LOCKDOWN -- NIGHT </b> Taryn is now scrawling notes on a pad.	Where is the money?
2 I don't know.	I think that you're lying. I think you know exactly where the money is.
3 You're trying to scare me into falsely incriminating myself... and it's not working. I said I'd tell you everything I know. You and your friends behind the mirror.

1 Is that you, Domino?	Nice to see you again, Edna.

1 Don't fuck with us, Edna! There are at least three more limbs where that one came from!	I can certainly think of one more!

1 <i>I was asleep in mum's guest house.</i> <b> INT. SOPHIE THOMAS MANSION -- BEDROOM -- NEXT </b> Domino is asleep in bed. The TELEPHONE rings.	Hello?
2 <i>We gotta go to work, Domino.</i>

1 We're late.	Fucking Map Quest. <i>Never again.</i> <b> EXT. DOWNTOWN GARAGE ROOFTOP -- NEXT </b> Ziering and Green approach a LARGE TENT. The WINNEBAGO is parked off to the side. Alf is inside... doing something with a WELDER on the front of the RV.

1 You were good.	Real good.

1 What do you want to live in a Black neighborhood for?  Motherfuck gentrification.	I'm under the assumption that this is a free country and one can live where he pleases.

1 Why it gotta be about jungle music and Africa?	It's about turning that shit off and getting the fuck outta my pizzeria.

1 No!	No!

1 Doctor, this is Da Mayor talkin'.	OK.  OK.
2 Doctor, always try to do the right thing.	That's it?
3 That's it.

1 Stop trying to play big brother. I'm a grown woman.  You gotta lotta nerve.  Mookie, you can hardly pay your rent and you're gonna tell me what to do.  Come off it.	One has nuthin' to do with the other.
2 Oh, it doesn't, huh!  You got your little 250 dollars a week plus tips...	I'm getting paid...
3 ...peanuts.	Pretty soon I'll be making a move.
4 I truly hope so.  I'm tired of supporting a grown man.

1 WAKE UP!	Fuck!  My money!

1 ML stands for ML.  That's it.	Naw, that's some stupid shit.  Now you know how I got that name.
2 Negroes kill me, always holdin' onto, talkin' 'bout their dicks.

1 Sal, if you want me to deliver any faster, get me a jet rocket or something, cuz I can't run with pizzas, all the cheese ends up on one side and shit.	I didn't say nuthin'.  You must have a guilty conscience.  What are you guilty of?
2 I'm not guilty of nuthin'.	You must be guilty of something or you would have never come in saying the things you said.
3 C'mon, Sal.	Where we goin'?

1 And I really wanted some ice cream too.	I can run out and get it.
2 No!  No!  You won't come back either.	I can't be staying long anyway.
3 How long then?	Long enough for us to do the nasty.
4 That's out.  No!  It's too hot! You think I'm gonna let you get some, put on your clothes, then run outta here and never see you again in who knows when?	A quickie is good every once in a blue moon.
5 You a blue-moon fool.	Then we'll do something else.
6 What else?	Trust me.
7 Trust you?  Because of trusting you we have a son.  Remember your son?	Trust me.

1 Shaddup, Vito.	Fuck dat shit.  I deliver pizzas. That's what I get paid for.
2 You get paid to do what we say.

1 Mister Seor Love Daddy is cool.	Ya like him, huh?
2 Yeah.	Y'know, Vito, I know Pino is ya brother and shit, but the next time he hits ya, the next time he touches ya, you should "house him." Kick his ass.
3 I don't know.	If you don't make a stand, he's gonna be beating ya like a egg for the rest of your life.
4 That's what you think?	That's what I think.
5 I don't like to fight.

1 Fuck you and stay off the phone.	Forget it, Mookie.

1 Sal's Famous Pizzeria, yeah, two large pizzas, pepperoni and anchovies, hold on...  See, Pop, Mookie fucking talking on the phone and people are trying to call in orders.  He's making us lose business.	Mookie, you're fucking up.
2 Twenty minutes.  How come you niggers are so stupid?

1 Both of youse--shaddup.  This is a place of business.	Tell 'em, Pop.

1 I don't get it. Why'd you make him a pirate?	I'll tell you why!

1 What? Well now I'm in a position where I may just heed your help.	Po, po, position...? Hey, here's thought, have you a bathroom?
2 Just down the hall.	Very good. Back in a jiff.

1 Wow, a treasure map! What's the treasure?	It could be anything. You're going to discover a whole new world when you get to school.
2 Wow just like Marco Polo.	I don't follow.
3 You know Mom, like in the pool.

1 God, she's beautiful. My wiener's all tingly.	Shift to your left.

1 Oh, yeah. Well I almost always beat Captain Rob.	Who's Captain Rob?
2 Just a guy I hang out with.	I know the type. Lives in the basement, smells like a sponge...
3 No! Captain Rob is seven feet tall, wears an eye patch, got a hook for a hand...	Sounds like a pirate.
4 What? No no. He's got a parrot on his shoulder, buries treasure...	Yeah, he's a pirate.
5 I don't think so. This guy drinks rum from a barrel, says "yo ho ho" has a peg leg...	Peg leg?
6 Yeah, go-cart accident.	Exactly! A pirate!
7 If he heard you talking like that he'd make you walk the plank.  Three, two, one. Now it's your turn, spin.	A-ha! You landed on Candyland! Now swallow it!

1 Can he do that?	HARRY, he can and he did. And now it's on like Donkey Kong.

1 Nope. I was right.	Wanna bet?

1 Don't snap at me like that. You're lucky I don't punch you right in the face.	Don't snap at me like that. You're lucky I don't punch you right in the face.

1 Wow, we built a whole float in one afternoon. And now the reward.	What do you mean? We can't go in there or we'll be "it".

1 You know Lloyd, the real treasure is our friendship.	How true. But I still feel I deserve more than you do of this treasure. I mean, I found it.
2 But my mom gave me the map.	I lugged it all over town!
3 I made the polar bear pants.	But I ate your Mom's pie.
4 I... found that rock.	It was a diamond and you swallowed it.

1 Wait, wait!	HARRY, are we gonna build this thing or not?
2 LLOYD, what I'm saying is we may already have what we want.

1 She's one of a kind.	Try one in a million!
2 Well, what should we do?

1 I'm going to ask you one last time and if I don't get an answer, I don't even want to think about the consequences which would be frightening to say the least. Where's my chest, Jessica?	I don't know what you're talking about.

1 What?	You know, "some". The fag stuff.
2 HARRY and I have been talking about school. In fact, I want to ask you something.	I know, you want go for a ride.

1 Don't worry about me, I'll be fine. I can take care of myself and I'm getting the story every high school reporter dreams of.	"My dream date with Principal Collins."

1 Mrs. D! I was hoping you'd show up.	Oh honey, I wouldn't miss this for the world.
2 Have you got what I want?	You know I do!
3 Oh yeah, give it to me.

1 Looking for a scoop, huh? I'll give you a scoop... of short bus.  Lose her!	Loser... oh yeah he was a loser alright. A big loser.
2 What?	He was a big loser! What are you deaf!?
3 Uh, no and I don't appreciate...turn down here!

1 You know honey, I've finally figured out a way of bilking enough money from the school to get us that condo in Waikiki.	How baby-cakes? You've done it all.
2 Small potatoes. This one is big time. This is visionary. This idea is genius.

1 Baby, I'm going to spend the morning at the mall. You know, shop for Waikiki. Honey, what are you looking for?	The chest! The chest that I put my papers in.
2 What papers?	The documents. The photos! The tapes! The evidence.
3 The evidence of what?	Sweetheart keep up with me for half a minute. The evidence of every scam we ever pulled. The evidence that's going to put us away for twenty years.

1 I understand we have you to thank for these stillsuits, Doctor.	They are Fremen suits. I hope they fit well, my lord.

1 I can assure you...	Do not interrupt!!! Do not speak lightly of the spice... ONE SMALL POINT...

1 Gurney... I see Thufir Hawat among the captives.  Let him stand free.	My Lord?
2 Let him stand free!

1 Remove her gag!	Excellent!

1 Stop him yourself.	You saw a part of what the race needs in the beginning.  In time you perverted the truth.  You sought to control human breeding and intermix a select few according to a selfish master plan.  How little you understand.

1 We surprised a band of smugglers.	Too bad... thought they were Harkonnen.

1 Don't try your powers on me.  Try looking into that place where you dare not look. You'll find me there staring back at you!! You Bene Gesserit have waited ninety generations to produce the one person your schemes required.  Here I stand.  But... I will never be yours.	Stop him, Jessica!

1 Bring me two more Beefeater martinis. Eddie will have another whiskey, Dagmar's a Rum-and-coke, Moustapha and King are chablis -- hey Bela, would you like a wine?	No.  I never drink -- wine.

1 They don't want the classic horror films anymore.  Today, it's all giant bugs, giant spiders, giant grasshoppers -- who would believe such nonsense!	The old ones were much spookier. They had castles, full moons...
2 They were <u>mythic</u>.  They had a poetry to them.  And you know what else?  The women prefer the traditional monsters.	The <u>women</u>?
3 The pure horror, it both repels and attracts them.  Because in their collective unconsciousness, they have the agony of childbirth.  The blood. The blood is horror.	I never thought of that.
4 Take my word for it.  You want to "score" with a young lady, you take her to see "Dracula."

1 You're right, Bela.  Now Dracula, <u>that's</u> a part that takes acting.	Of course!  Dracula requires <u>presence</u>.  It's all in the voice, and the eyes, and the hand --

1 "Greetings.  I am the Count."	"Greetings.  I am Slick Slomopavitz, Seeker of Adventure." Audience laughs.  Applause.  "Say, that's a funny place to sleep."
2 "It is my home."	"Oh, tract housing, huh?"  Laugh. "You need a new real estate agent."
3 "Beg to differ.  This casket incarpratates, er, inporporates --"

1 In life, the decisions that haunt you are the ones where you just don't know... where right or wrong will never be answered.  Years ago, the Hungarians contacted me.  The government wanted me to come home, to be Minister of Culture.	Really?
2 It was a very impressive offer. Fancy offices, a big home... I'd be treated like a king.	So why didn't you do it?
3 I didn't know if it was a trick. They might arrest me and throw me in a gulag.  I am Hungary's most famous emigrant. they'd use me as a lesson to anyone who tries to leave.	But maybe not.
4 Correct.  So instead, I stayed here, waiting for my comeback.  Always hoping... the next film, the next film... that would be the one.

1 What are you doing?	I was thinking about killing myself.
2 Jesus Christ, what an evening.  What happened?	Eddie, I received a letter from the government.  They're cutting off my unemployment.  That's all I've got. Without it, I can't pay the rent...
3 Don't you have any savings?	I'm obsolete.  I have nothing to live for.  Tonight, I should die.  And you should come with me.

1 Last night was quite a romp.	Did you see that kid grab Vampira's tits?
2 I envied him.  Hell, I envied you too, having a girlfriend that would jump in front of a car like that.	Yeah, she's really somethin'.
3 I know none of <u>my</u> wives would've.

1 Hey Ed, shouldn't we do another take? Big Baldy kinda got stuck in the doorway.	No, it's fine.  It's real!  In actuality, Lobo would struggle with that problem every day.

1 Incidentally, you <u>promise</u> you're not going to scratch my car...?	I told you, the octopus is made of rubber.  This is a piece o' cake.

1 How long have you been doing this?	Since I was a kid.  My mom wanted a girl, so she used to dress me in girlie clothing.  It just kinda became a habit.
2 Jesus Christ!  And you never told me?	This is my way of telling you --
3 What, by putting it in a fuckin' script, for everyone to see?!  What kind of sick mind would operate like that?

1 It was the only way I could get the movie made!	Who do you think's been paying the rent?!  Who helped type your script, and did all your grunt work?!
2 I'm sorry!  What did you want me to say?	I wanted you to say, "No!  I wrote the part for my girlfriend Dolores."
3 But there's plenty of other parts.	Like <u>what</u>?!
4 The secretary.  Or the file clerk.

1 Perhaps you'd like to look at the photoplay.	Oh my, this is very interesting.  Say... do you think it would be possible for me to maybe play one of these parts?
2 Oh, of course!!  There's a couple characters you'd be perfect for: The secretary at the newspaper office, or the file clerk!	Hmm.  Those sound kind of small.  Oh, here's one that looks good: Janet Lawton.  I'd sure like to play her.

1 Well... I've got another project I wasn't gonna tell you about. Lugosi's in it, but he's got a smaller part.  The lead is an ingenue, a sterling young actress named Dolores Fuller.  The title is "Bride Of The Atom."	Ah!  Atomic Age stuff, huh?  I like it.  I'll tell you what, Mr. Ward.  Why don't you leave those film cans, and my associates and I will take a look at your little opus.  Maybe we can do business together.

1 Mr. Reynolds!	Yes?
2 We are gonna finish this film <u>just</u> <u>the way I want it</u>!  Because you can't compromise an artist's vision!

1 I'd be happy too, if I had such a great family.	Don't worry.  You just haven't met right woman yet.  Oopsy.  That cabbage goes right through me.

1 It opens in nine weeks in Tulsa.	Well, Mr. Weiss, I'm your guy.  I work fast, and I'm a deal: I write AND direct.  And I'm good.  I just did a play in Hollywood, and Victor Crowley praised its realism.
2 Hmm.  There's five-hundred guys in town who can tell me the same thing. You said on the phone you had some kind of "special qualifications."

1 I think it's fifty-seven minutes long.	Yeah?  Whatever.  So did you like it?
2 Ed, what was the one thing I asked you to do?  Make it <u>seven reels long</u>. I've got contracts with my exhibitors.  If it ain't over an hour, they won't play it.	Gee, I used every frame of film we shot.  Maybe they won't notice.
3 They'll notice.  Look, why don't you let me take over from here?  I can do a few tricks: Pad it out with more stock footage, add establishing shots...	Um, I guess --
4 Good.  And one more thing.  I think your "Written, Directed, and Starring Ed Wood" credit is a bad idea.	Why?!  I did all those things!  Hell, I even built the props.
5 And you did a bang-up job, too.  But you don't want other producers to know that's you in drag.  Trust me. It's a career killer.

1 Oh.  I loved those shows!  "Inner Sanctum"... "The Shadow" --	Yeah!  Don't forget "Mercury Theatre"... And then every Saturday, I'd go to the little movie theater down the street.  I even started ushering there.

1 Those assholes.	The poor girl's out of a job.
2 Yeah...  I should give her a call.

1 Look... would it be possible to make the "Ghoul's Wife" a little less prominent, so people won't really notice me in the movie?	You don't wanna be noticed?
2 Exactly.  Hey, how 'bout this -- what if I don't have any lines?  I'll do the part mute!

1 Norma, this is Bela -- Bela, this is Norma.  Norma, this is Tor -- Tor, this is Norma.  Norma, this is Paul Paul, this is Norma.	So how long have you known Eddie?

1 My goodness, you're embarrassing me.	You shouldn't be embarrassed by the truth.  Mind if I order some hotcakes...?

1 What do you love her or something?	Come on...
2 Look at your face. I had a car that color.

1 Yeah only I wish they had the sister on more.	Ooh, the sister! She is hot.
2 You know it.

1 Ed, everything goes off. "Cheers" went off. "Mash" went off --	Yeah, but when they went off people weren't making fun of them. They weren't bozos! I'm Pumpkin Ass again!
2 Ed --	You know, everything you asked me to do I did. I call you for advice about Shari you say -  "Leave her be, see other people for a while." You just wanted me to get involved with Jill because it made for a better show.
3 Ed --	No. You screwed up my life just so you could get higher ratings. You never gave a shit about me.
4 Yeah? Well I'm not starting now.

1 You know who we are?	Tell me.
2 We're the guys who clean up after the parade.	I'm gonna stick this right in your eye.
3 I was at this comedy club last week and this comedian says "If you're over thirty and your job requires you to wear a name tag, you screwed up your life." And I'm laughing and then I realize I wear a nametag.	So do I. So what? I'm doing all right.
4 Your brother's here.

1 I told you the facts! He abandoned us -- those are the facts.	So everything he told me yesterday was a lie. Everything.

1 Ed! How did you know I was here?	You're famous. Somebody called me. What are you doing in a place like this?
2 Why shouldn't I be in a place like this? I'm a whore!	Ma...
3 I'm a tramp  Meet your new father. The whole nation is laughing at us!	And how is this helping? come on say, good-night to all your new friends and let's go home.
4 I'm a whore!  Your bathrooms are filthy!

1 Oh! Oh -- okay, now I get it. It's "Star Search." You wanted me here because the camera comes with me.	Ed, he needs a break. You don't know what kind of bad luck he's had --
2 I can imagine. You said you wanted nothing to do with this. You swore to me. "Don't come near me. Don't bring this into my life..."

1 Don't defend that horse's ass to me.	I'm not. I'm not. I'm just Look -- you know, in a way, it's good. He got this out of his system now and he knows it's not worth it and, you know, someday if you guys got married or something --
2 Ha!	Okay ...
3 I've got news for you-- I never intended to marry him.	Oh... how come?

1 Um...	What?

1 This is going right up your ass.	Come on.

1 You would do this? You would actually --	In a second! In a hot second. Let me ask you something --
2 Why do you do that?	What?
3 Whenever you ask me something why do you always say "Let me ask you something?" Why don't you just ask me?	All right. Let me ask you something... are you happy like this?
4 I'm doing all right.	Oh Yeah? What's your master plan here?

1 Who is it?	It's me, Ed.

1 Come on, Ma.	Let's remember how I got into this. "Please, Eddie, do this for me. I can't get a break." 
2 You know what your problem is?	Yeah. My problem is I've got a brother who writes a sentence like "We grew up in a small, little bedroom." As opposed to a big, little bedroom?
3 I got paid by the word! No! Your problem is you don't ever want anything to be your fault.	Me?! That's you!
4 I commit. I take a chance. You wanted to be the guy on TV, but you didn't want to say you wanted to. So you have me talk you into it so you get what you want, but if it goes bad it's not your fault.

1 -- That we were doing "together." I finished it. It came out great! Because no one was standing over my shoulder bothering me - "That's too much glue. You're using too much glue."	Do you still have it?
2 No. Ray sat on it. I'11 see you.

1 Ohhh...	Ed?
2 Ohh... do you own a cat?	Yeah. Why?

1 Sherry   Sherry  Sheerrry. ...	He ended up moving back to Milwaukee to live with his parents. I haven't heard from him in a long time. Poor guy. I warned him.

1 Don't you smartass me!  Don't you dare smartass me!  You just shut your mouth I  Now your mother and I have had a long talk with Halt Hendricks  --- we just got off the phone with him at home. You know, he doesn't want you back at Millard.  He's fed up with you.  Fed up!  And I don't blame him!	Dick... Dick,..
2 What?	Tammy,  now we've come to a decision. He just think it would be best --
3 You're going to Catholic school next year.  You're going to Sacred Heart. Maybe they'll straighten you out!

1 Good morning, Mr. McAllister.	Not wasting any time, are you, Tracy?
2 You know what they say about the early bird.	Yes, I do.

1 You're the advisor.  You should stop her.  She's not qualified.  She's just a sophomore.	Calm down, Tracy.  Just calm down.
2 Are you sure all her signatures are real?  It's not easy to get all those signatures.	As far as I know, they--

1 Hello, Mr. M.	Hello, Tracy.

1 What a surprise.	Take as much room as you want

1 Could you get this? I can't	Sure.

1 Fine.  Let's say all you ever knew was apples.  Apples, apples and more apples. You might think apples were pretty good, even if you occasionally got a rotten one. Then one day there's an orange. And now you can make a decision. Do you want an apple, or do you want an orange? That's democracy.	I also like bananas.
2 Exactly.  So what do you say?  Maybe it's time to give a little something back.

1 Uhhh... teeth. Teeth.	Sorry.

1 Yes, Paul?	Have a great summer.  And good luck at college.
2 Thanks.  You too.  It was great working with you.

1 Can I get you a drink?	Yeah, plain scotch.

1 I want to know about Exley.	He's the opposite of you.  He's more like me.  Cold, calculating.
2 How'd you get to know so much about him?

1 You know him?	Seen him around.  He used to be a cop.

1 Where are we going?	It's a surprise.  You like surprises, don't you, White?

1 You expecting problems?	Patchett uses a lot of ex-cop muscle.

1 Where's the other guy?  Buzz.	He no longer works for me.  Find Susan's killer, Mr. White. I'll give you a handsome reward. <u>Whatever you desire</u>.

1 Whose shoe?	Susan Lefferts.
2 If she was sitting here, then it's facing the wrong way.  What are these smears in the blood?	It looks like she was flailing, trying to get away.
3 But she's moving away from the door.  Who was sitting at this table?	Dick Stensland.  Had to be dumb panic.  If she knew him she would've been sitting with him... Right?

1 You look like Robinson after that last LaMotta fight.  'Course LaMotta looked a lot worse.  So you're twenty-two, right?	Man, why do you keep asking me that?
2 Just getting my facts straight. Twenty-two makes it a gas chamber bounce. You should have pulled this caper a couple of years ago.  Get life, do a little Youth Authority jolt, transfer to Folsom a big man. Orbit on some of that good prison brew, get yourself a sissy --	I never truck with no sissies!
3 That fucking Larry.  I almost believed him.	Believed what?
4 Nothing, Ray.  That Larry, he's a pisser.  You did the Casitas Youth Camp with him, didn't you?	Man, why're you talkin' about Larry?  His business is his business.

1 That was his favorite toast.  I saw the test results on the lieutenant's exam.  You placed first out of twenty-three.	The youngest applicant by eight years.
2 You'll make lieutenant inside a year.  Patrol division?	I was thinking Detective Bureau.

1 No... Where'd the tip come from?	Anonymous.  Probably nothing.

1 Damnit...	What?
2 Glasses.	Just don't shoot me.

1 What are you going to do?	I'm going to Lynn Bracken's.  I'll meet you at the Dining Car.
2 Great.  You get the girl, I get the coroner.

1 How was I?	Oh, the best I ever had. Absolutely the best.
2 You sound like you mean it.	The silver screen's loss is your gain.
3 How about White?	You want to know what Bud's like in bed?

1 It seems like my Susan, but...	When was the last time you saw her, Mrs. Lefferts?
2 At Christmas.  We had fought.  I didn't like her boyfriend.  I -- she has a birthmark on her hip.

1 You're back, boychick.	Sid, how are they hanging?
2 Down around my ankles.

1 Fleaur-de-Lis.  'Whatever you desire.'	Dope, liquor, hookers that look like movie stars.  Pierce Patchett has it all.

1 Um...who's that?	Don't know. Did you check everywhere? Maybe it was hidden in something. Maybe there was someone else--
2 Someone else?	Maybe you bumped into someone who took it and you didn't even know.

1 Why don't you just call Brill directly.	I don't know who he is.
2 I'm told you had an affair with Rachel Banks four years ago.	Told by whom?
3 Considering the enormous exposure to which you've subjected this firm, I'd think you'd do best to simply answer my questions.	Really?
4 Yes.	Well considering what a colossal douche bag you are, David, maybe I'd do best to simply kick your ass all over the capitol.

1 The NSA's been in bed with the entire tele-communications industry since the 40's. They've infected everything: Banks, computers, phones, mail, name it.  The more technology we buy into, the easier it is keeping tabs on us. It's a brave new world.  At least it better be.	How do you know so much?
2 None of your business.	You used to work for 'em, didn't you?
3 I was a traffic analyst.

1 These guys are incredibly persistent.	Tell me about it.

1 He came in four minutes ago.	C'mon.

1 I think she'll like this very much.	Listen, Daniel, hang on one second.
2 For that matter, I think you will too.	Could you give me just a moment to talk to a friend of mine here? Not about this, but...Daniel?

1 I don't understand why Jerry couldn't clear this up.	Well, you know--
2 He's got his priorities?	There's just, clearly, some administrative snafu. I'm sure this is the worst of it.

1 Are you sure you're safe?	Yeah.

1 And then what?	I'll see if I can, you know, work things out.

1 Any idea what he looks like?	My guess is male, somewhere in his 40's or 50's.

1 Robert--	Gimme a week and four guys from litigation and I'll have the Post pleading with us not to sue for libel.

1 How long can you stay?	I'm not goin' anywhere, Eric. I live here.

1 Was Zavitz in trouble?	I don't know.

1 I sit on top of the greatest intelligence gathering organization in human history. Why can't I bring in a man whose name <i>is in the</i> <i><u>fucking</i></u> <i><u>phonebook</i></u>?!	He's clever. He had help.
2 He's clever? He had help?  Oh.	Sir--
3 No, no, I'm sorry. I didn't realize you were hoping to be transferred to a weathership outside Greenland.	I just meant--
4 I don't care if he's Solomon with Saint Joseph sitting in his <u>lap</u>. I want the tape and I want him. Now is--

1 Thank you.	I wanted to meet a man who could write such a long paper with so few adjectives.
2 A thing is still a thing no matter what you place in front of it.  Big car, slow car, chauffeur-driven car, still a car.

1 You should come into the shelter.	I'm quite all right, thank you.
2 Look over there.

1 When were you most happy?	Now.
2 When were you least happy?	Now.
3 Okay.  And what do you love? Say everything.	What do I love?  I love rice pudding, and water, the fish in it, hedgehogs! The gardens at our house in Freshwater - all my secret paths.

1 I just know - any minute he'll find out, we'll barge into somebody we'll - and it will ill him.	Don't go over it again, please.

1 Do you promise?  I wouldn't want to die here.  I wouldn't want to die in the desert. I've always had a rather elaborate funeral in mind, with particular hymns.  Very English.  And I know exactly where I want to be buried.  In our garden.  Where I grew up. With a view of the sea.  So promise me you'll come back for you.	I promise I'll come back.  I promise I'll never leave you.  And there's plenty of water and food. You can have a party.

1 What did you think you were doing in his tent?	Looking for the fossils.  Why should we wait until we're in London?  This girl was probably twelve years old.
2 You shouldn't go into another man's tent. It's inexcusable.	Her hands and feet were tied.
3 What did you do?	I looked at them.  They're shrubs, small trees.  Exquisite.  And fossilized, rock hard. He walks away to the nose of the plane.
4 I was talking about the girl.	Cut the ropes.  I left a note, on his blanket.  At the next Geographical Society I shall await with great interest the announcement of the Fenelon-Barnes Slave Knot.  The Girl wouldn't leave, of course.  Her father had sold her for a camel. He turns over the propeller, the engine cranks up.

1 How are you?	Okay.
2 Your leg will be fine.  A lot of shrapnel came out - I saved you the pieces.	You're the prettiest girl I ever saw.

1 Supper. Hana calls after him.	Where've you been?
2 Rabbit hunting.

1 I think anybody she ever loves tends to die on her.	Are you planning to be the exception?
2 Me?  You've got the wrong end of the stick, old boy.  So - Caravaggio - Hana thinks you invented your name.	And you've forgotten yours.
3 I told her you would never invent such a preposterous name.	I told her you can forget everything but you never forget your name.

1 You get to the morning and the poison leaks away, doesn't it? Black nights, fucking black nights, when you want to howl like a dog. I thought I would kill you.  You killed my friends, you ruined my hands.  But the girl was always here, like some Guardian Angel.	You can't kill me.  I died years ago.
2 No, now I can't kill you.

1 And a special thank you to Geoffrey and Katharine, without whose fund raising heroics we should still be kicking our heels. They toast the Cliftons.	To arm-twisting.
2 Did Katharine say? - Geoffrey has to fly back to Cairo.	Have to return the favor - take a few photographs for the army.

1 Excuse me -	Yes?
2 Can I ask - my friend, can he come in? Just for a few minutes?	Your friend?
3 He's going back to the front this evening.  I can't see him otherwise.	Just go off.  I'll be quite all right.
4 No, I can't go, but if it, if you weren't offended, it would be very good of you to allow us - every other cabin is crammed. This is as private as we'll get.	Well then - yes.  Of course.
5 Thank you.  Thank you.

1 You like him, don't you?  Your voice changes.	I don't think it does.  Anyway, he's indifferent to me.
2 I don't think it's indifference.

1 For my hair?	Yes, for your hair.

1 This is hot!	Nya-nya-nya!

1 I was looking for the Lieutenant Singh.	He's sleeping.
2 Only we have to go to work.	I'll tell him.  What is it?  Is it a mine?
3 A bomb.  At the Viaduct. She closes the door, then reappears.	Does he have to go?
4 Pardon me?	What if you couldn't find him?  Sergeant, not today, please. Not this morning.

1 Darling, Peter says I could stay	Why not?

1 Where were you? I called at 4:30 this morning.	There are times when you don't answer the phone.

1 We've got to catch him in the act.	Why didn't I think of that?
2 It's not the thinking of it, it's the doing it.	With that computer--nobody better. Out there...it's different. You twisted your ankle stepping over a curb on Madison Avenue.

1 Believe me, if you weren't so tiresome, I'd have one for you.	Something of great value, something of such artistic and historic significance that only you could truly appreciate...

1 You're shaking. Are you nervous?	No. Why would I be?
2 Because you young Americans think the world began when you were born. You fall apart when you don't get your own way.

1 Very nice.	Not a word.

1 What the hell was that?	Not bad. I didn't expect you to make it out.
2 You what--?

1 Nothing? You don't even lock the door?	I guess I have a more optimistic view of human nature than you do.

1 You don't have any idea how lucky you are!	A lifelong problem, I'm afraid.
2 No, dammit! I mean me! That Rembrandt...that Rembrandt!

1 Did I hear a car?	Our equipment has arrived.
2 Hmmm.

1 Won't take any time.	Straight down the drive, right at the hedgerow, follow the lane. Don't blink, you'll miss it.

1 Don't turn. I'm counting the steps to the entrance.	These rooms are solid stone. They haven't changed.
2 You can't be too careful.	Yes, you can.  You can spoil a perfectly nice dance.

1 STOP! You're making...mistake.	It's your mistake.
2 The big job.	There is no big job.

1 I'll need the Rembrandt now.	Sure, it's only worth 25 million or so, don't bother telling me what you're going to do with it.
2 I told you. It's the down payment. And thanks to you it's overdue.

1 Peoples China Bank.	Where the money is.

1 No way to take another day or two?	No. You'll see when we get inside.

1 And when, eventually, everyone discovers what transaction XJ6 was really about...	China will think it happened before midnight. Britain will swear it happened after midnight...
2 They'll each be positive the other guy did it.  I fear an ugly international incident.

1 Put this on!	I'm not leaving without you.

1 I'd give you a hand but it wouldn't look good.	Yeah, the lord of the manor doesn't haul his own groceries.
2 And you do it so well.

1 Oh, look at me, darling. I thought this gentleman was a waiter.	You damn well thought wrong.
2 I'm terribly sorry old man.

1 See you.	Probably not.
2 Yeah. Probably not.

1 Tequila.  From your drug dealer friend.	Carlos isn't a friend; he's a client.
2 He's a low-life.  Speaking of which, that's your nine o'clock in there.

1 This is a real nice place you got here.	Well it oughta be, with all the work I put into it.

1 You wouldn't happen to have a little time right now, would you, Donna?	For what?
2 Well, I was gonna head over to the Browns now.  I was thinking -- Mandy really values your opinion ...

1 You never called me back.  I left messages.	You did?  Wow, sorry about that.  Listen, Mario's a little not so bright.  He seems to think that you said --
2 There's two things I can't stand, Mr. Masry. Being ignored, and being lied to.  You did both.

1 Come on, I'm trying to help here.	Bullshit.  You're trying to feel less guilty about firing someone with three kids to feed.  Fuck if I'll help you do that.

1 Mr. Masry, Mario gets lost going to the bathroom.  They'll be driving around the valley for hours.	Yeah.  Isn't that a shame?

1 What now?	Another raise wouldn't hurt.  And with all the time I'm gonna be spending on the road, I'll probably be needing my own cel phone, won't I?

1 I like this case.	Really?  It makes me sick.
2 Me too.  That's why I like it.  It's been a long time since I had a case I cared about.	You didn't care about my case?
3 I would now.

1 What kind of things come up?	Things like the head counsel for PG&E calling me with an offer.  20 million, plus attorney's fees.  Take it or leave it.
2 Whoa.  No shit.	It's about 50 thousand per plaintiff.
3 So what are you thinking?	I'm thinking ... I wish someone else had to make this decision.  50 thousand bucks is more than any other California toxic plaintiff has gotten. Ever.  But ...
4 ... but it won't cover Annabelle Daniels's medical bills.	And it's less than pocket change for PG&E.
5 Do you think we'd do better by going to trial?	Maybe.  but maybe not.  We still don't have anything linking this to PG&E corporate. Plus, there's the statute problem.  Plus, we're way short on manpower, so we'd need to bring on more lawyers ...
6 Plus, 40 percent of 20 million's a whole lot of money.	It's eight million dollars, Erin.  Eight million dollars.

1 Don't give me that.  You've gotten plenty. You've been well-paid; you've gotten lots of perks ...	Perks?  Jesus -- <u>perks</u>?

1 When'd they file the demur?	Yesterday.

1 Pattee?  That your middle name?	Nope.  Maiden.
2 You're married.	Not anymore.

1 What are you <u>doing</u>?  Where's George?	I don't know.
2 George!

1 Randy's mom said yes right away.	Well, God damn it, Matthew -- Randy's mom doesn't work eighteen-hour days, and Randy's dad didn't leave her, so figuring out who's gonna take who where is a little easier over at Randy's house.

1 Ooh, now, see, if I'da known there was a beautiful woman next door, I'da done this different.  Let's start over.  My name's George.  What's yours?	Just think of me as the person next door who likes it quiet, and we'll get along fine.
2 Now, don't be like that.  Tell you what. How about if I take you out on a date to apologize for my rudeness?

1 You think it could make you sick, living in a place like this?	What do you mean?

1 I'm so tired I'm about to drive off the road.  Keep me awake, willya?	What do you want, a joke?
2 No, no jokes, I gotta pee.  Just tell me about your day.  What went on back there?	Well, come to think of it, we did have a big event around here.  Beth started talking.
3 What?  Beth?  My Beth?	Yeah.  We were sitting around at lunch and she pointed at a ball and said, "ball."

1 Thank you.	Mm-hm.

1 I'm embarrassed.	That's okay.  I understand.
2 It's just -- the pain.  It's only getting worse.  I can't be a good wife.  I can't be a good mother.	I'm real sorry, Laura.

1 I know.  It's an awful lot.	I'm surprised Donna didn't say anything.

1 It was .... the Emperor ....	The Emperor?
2 Yes, he commands you make contact with him ....	Move this ship out of the asteroid field and into a position where we can send a clear transmission.
3 Yes, My Lord.	And code the signal to my private chamber.

1 Told you, I did.  Reckless is he ... Now things are going to worse.	The boy is our last hope.
2 No ... there is another.

1 Howls.	We're not out of this yet.

1 Barks his consternation.	Chewie, head for the bottom of the city.

1 Commander Skywalker hasn't come through the south entrance, sir. Maybe he slipped by without checking in.	Not likely!  Where are the speeders?
2 We haven't got them adapted to this cold yet ...	We'll have to go out on Tauntauns.
3 The temperature is dropping too fast.	You bet it is ... and Luke's out in it.

1 Sir, I was wondering ...	Sit down, and shut up!
2 It can wait.

1 Now all we've got to worry about is what attacked him.	No kidding.  If this snowball's got nasty natives, they could be anywhere.

1 That was no laser blast .... some- thing hit us ....	Or you ran into something ....

1 Sure.  I guess I make it difficult sometimes.	Yes, you do.
2 You could be a touch warmer, though.  Admit it, against your better judgment you think I'm all right.

1 Couldn't be, I checked the transfer circuits, just like you said!  I tell you this time it's not my fault.  I'm sure I checked it.	No lightspeed?
2 It's not my fault.  I can't under- stand it!

1 He found him in a junk pile ...	Something's wrong here.  Your friend Lando is very charming, but I don't trust him.
2 Well, I do trust him.  Lando's an old friend.  Must have been an accident.	Chewie, do you think you can repair him?

1 That won't be easy, my friend ... What brings you here, anyway?	Repairs ...
2 What have you done to my ship?

1 I'll take what's mine now.	Take them, but I'm keeping a detachment of troops here to watch over them.
2 That wasn't the bargain.  You said the Empire wouldn't interfere in--	I'm altering the bargain.  Pray I don't alter it any further.

1 Very noble.  Not smart, but noble.	You've probably never done an honorable thing in your life.
2 Sure I did ... once.  It turned out lousy.	What chance have we got in here? What are we going to do when they cut ...

1 The speeders should be ready in the morning.  They'll make the search easier.	Is there any chance of them surviving out there?
2 Slim, but yes, there's a chance. They have a shelter.  It's not much, but ...

1 Rather touchy, aren't they.	I thought you knew this person.

1 I have followed my feelings.	You are reckless!

1 I feel cold.	This tree is strong with the dark side of The Force.  A servant of evil it is.  Into it you must go.
2 What's in there?	Only what you take with you.

1 There is no escape.  You must join me or die.  Don't make me destroy you here ... The Emperor is strong with The Force.  But if you join me, together we could overthrow Him.  Do not resist. It is our destiny!	Never.

1 Zira, are you mad?	Dr. Milo, please don't call my wife mad.
2 I did not call her mad.  I merely asked her if she was.  And I repeat the question.  Are you mad?

1 ComStat did a psychosearch on him. Used a database of 5 million sociopathic personalities. He hit the bottom of the curve.	Perfect for the mission. Nobody else can pull it off - not an army, not a man.
2 Zero emotional developments. Total lack of compassion. A highly developed psychopathic instinct to survive.

1 Come on, Cuervo. I delivered him, didn't I? All I'm asking for is what you promised.	We'll see.

1 I need a favor.	What's in it for me?

1 Shut up, Plissken.	What's the little black box do?
2 Top secret. Only on a need to know.	And I don't need to know. So fuck you, I'm goin' to Hollywood.
3 That's right, big shot. Unless you do what we want you're not coming back.	So what's the deal, huh? Go into L.A., find the President's daughter, secure the box, and bring 'em both out - and I'm free?
4 That's the deal.	Tell the President to adopt. I think I'll like L.A.

1 Got a smoke?	You're gonna have to learn to respect the law, Snake. The United States is a no- smoking nation. No smoking, no drinking, do drugs, no women unless you're married, no guns, no foul language. It's a brand new day for you, Snake.
2 The name's Plissken.

1 Where is it?	Right over there.

1 What're you doing in here?	Looking to get out.
2 Good. I want you out. This is my sewer.	Which way?

1 How do we get out of here?	Sewers. Come on.

1 You owe me. You left me holdin' everything back there in Cleveland.	Hershe, you were in Cleveland?
2 Yeah. With me and Texas Mike O'Shay.

1 Fight me from your horse or on foot, but fight me. Your avoidance mocks me.	I sought only not to harm you, sir.

1 Arthur.	Lancelot, I will save you... Don't die.

1 It is whispered in the forest that...  ...Leondegrance's castle is under siege by Lot and Uryens.	Yes, yes, I know that. Everybody does. Lord Leondegrance is my only ally among the barons and the great knights. I can't lose him.
2 Well there. You don't need me half as much as you think you do. You already know what must not happen.	I must find the means to save him, then. I was hoping I could ask you for a little magic help, but if it makes you so tired...
3 Thank you.

1 The knights of Galys approach the camp. It would be politic...	...to ride out and meet them.

1 Father...	Rise, Mordred.
2 I have come to claim what is mine, Father.	I recognize you only as my son, no more.
3 And you are the great King? The lords have rebelled. Invaders attack the coasts. Crops don't grow. There is nothing but plague and hunger in the land. Only I am feared. I will be king. You may have lost Excalibur, but I have found my own weapon of power. There.

1 No, I think it's better if you just stay here to heal. At least a week.	I'm going.
2 Quiet, or I'll sew up your mouth too.

1 There are things about love--	--Nothing!

1 When Arthur built the castle, I carved out a place for myself, where I could laugh or sleep, and no one would bother me.	People make you laugh?

1 I have walked my way since the beginning of time. Sometimes I give, sometimes I take. It is mine to know which, and when.	Dumb riddles, Merlin. I am your King.

1 Quite frankly, we don't know much about it except that it's starts with some conflict or guilt that eventually leads to the patient's delusion that his body's been invaded by an alien intellegence; a spirit if you will.	Look, I'm telling you again and you'd better believe it, I'm not about to put her in a goddamn asylum!
2 It's-	And I don't care what you call it! I'm not putting her away!
3 I'm sorry.	You're sorry. Christ, eighty-eight doctors and all you can tell me is all of your bullshit...

1 Where do you want this?	What is it?
2 Phonograph.	Storage.

1 Good morning Madame.	Good morning Karl. Oh Karl, we've got rats in the attic you better get some traps.
2 Rats?	Uh huh. 'Fraid so.

1 Is it coming out Willie?	Yes, I think so.

1 Oh, I'm very sorry Father. Hi.	That's okay. I should've told you I wouldn't be in uniform.
2 Yeah, it would've helped. Have you gotta cigarette Father?

1 Yes. He's already here.	Father?

1 Captain Howdy, Do you think my mom's pretty? Captain Howdy? Captain Howdy that isn't very nice.	Well, maybe he's sleeping.
2 You think?

1 All done.	Honey this is Father Dyer.
2 Hi Father.

1 Lieutenant?	I came to say goodbye.
2 You just missed them.	How's the girl?
3 She seemed fine.	Ah, that's good. That's all that's important. Back to business. Back to work. Bye now, Father.
4 Good bye.

1 What's that?	Holy water.

1 Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day, our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation.	But deliver us from the evil one.

1 Why this girl it makes no sense?	I think the point is to make us dispair... To see our selves as... animal and ugly... To reject the possibillity that God could love us.

1 Almighty Lord, word of God the father Jesus Christ, God and Lord of all creation, who gave to your holy apostle the power to tramp underfoot serpents and scorpions. Grant me, your unworthy servant pardon for all my sins...	Bastards! Stop!

1 What're you saying, Charlie?	Look, Frankie.  You and Jack been playing here, a long time.
2 Twelve years.	Right, twelve years.  Couple times a month.
3 So?	So maybe it's time we took a vacation from each other.
4 Vacation?  Christ, Charlie, it's a Monday night. You said so yourself.	It wasn't half full out there tonight, Frankie. I got six waiters standing in back listening to baseball.  I gotta move the liquor. To move the liquor, I gotta fill the tables. It's a matter of economics.  Me, I love you. I love both you guys, you know that. You're class.  But people today. They don't know class if it walks up and grabs 'em by the balls.

1 Knee.  Tore it up against St. Anthony's.  Right before the accident.	Accident?
2 The fire.  The way we're going we'll be lucky to buy a carton of jockstraps, let alone a new gym.

1 Tag 'em, Willie.  The Regency downtown, Thursday-Friday.  Thanks.	My pleasure.

1 Listen ... why don't you come out to the house this weekend.  Say hello to the kids. They've grown.	I hate your kids, Frank.
2 You're their uncle.	Only by relation.  Besides, they hate me, too.
3 They don't.  They're always asking about you.	They tried to electrocute me, Frank.
4 It was an accident.	It was no fucking accident, Frank. The little one ...
5 Cindy.	She threw a goddamn radio into the bathtub. How do you explain that?
6 She didn't know what she was doing. You're too sensitive.	You got weird kids, Frank.
7 Look, I just thought if you came out you might see what you're missing.

1 Yeah?	It's me.
2 Frank?	Yeah.  Listen ... come out to the house tomorrow, will ya?
3 I've had enough family for one month, Frank.	It's not family.  It's business.
4 So talk to me tomorrow.  After the gig.	We don't get a gig.
5 What're you talking about?	Something came up.  Don't worry, Charlie stayed true.  Both nights. I'll give you your share tomorrow. At the house.

1 Jack.	Let's get it over with.
2 All right.  What's your name?

1 See anything?	How about these?
2 Jack, for crying out loud.  Your bachelorhood's showing.  Ah, here we go.

1 When's the last time we played a wedding, Jack?	Two years ago.  March.

1 Thank you, thank you.  You know, Susie and Jack and I only just arrived here yesterday, but already the people here at the King Corporation's Moorish Manor have made us feel, well, a part of the family. And it's their hope that, before you leave, everyone of you will feel a part of that family also.  So, if during-the next few days, we should happen to pass one another in the hallway or in the lobby or wherever ... don't be a stranger. Stop.  Say hello.  Introduce yourself.  Because here, there are no strangers, only friends. And family.  Right, Jack?	Right.  I love you, Frank.
2 What?	I love you.  I just wanted to say it.

1 The Royal.	Right.  The Royal.  When's the last time we were there?
2 Couple years.	February?
3 April.	Right.  It's incredible how you do that.  Remember things.
4 A useless talent.	Drove me crazy when we were kids. The way you never looked at the music. Miss Simpson would just play it and ...

1 What's happening to you, Frank?  You been kissing ass so long you're starting to like it?  You let that guy turn us into clowns tonight.  We were always small time, but we were never clowns, Frank. What's happened to your dignity?	Dignity?  Who the hell are you to talk about dignity?

1 Charlie called.	Yeah?
2 Yeah.  Larry Shelton.  Blackie.  Couple others. Donna said even Lloyd called the other day. Nothing like a little absence to make the heart grow fonder, huh?	Yeah.

1 This where the auditions are?	This is where the auditions were.
2 What do you mean?	We're finished.
3 What about me?

1 Ready?	What are we, an orchestra all of a sudden?

1 We need scissors over here! Who's got scissors?  Okay, remember.  Jack and I go on first, I do the set-up, then introduce you. And you say ...	Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I can't tell you how thrilled I am to be here. It's like a dream come true. And speaking of dreams ...
2 Right.	Piece of cake.

1 You two could play checkers.	Maybe we should just listen to the radio.
2 Sorry.  It only plays static.

1 Oh yeah?	He's just afraid to show it. Aren't you, little brother?

1 Tom here tells me there's a problem with the pianos.  We were assured they were in tune.	Yes, well, they are.
2 Then I'm afraid I don't understand.	They are in tune.  But not with each other.
3 Is that important?	Uh, well ...

1 You should've brought a leash, Mr. Barker. The doctor doesn't like to be bitten.	He doesn't bite.
2 They never do, Mr. Barker.	Baker.
3 Right.  In there.

1 The Park?  It's only two nights. Why throw away a night?	Because Blackie Carson books the Park and whenever we've needed a gig he's come through.
2 Oh.  Well, for Blackie then.

1 It wasn't business.  It was pleasure.	Just dinner and dance, right?

1 The both of them?  In there?	He called her.
2 Oh. So what's it doing here?	Long story.
3 You sending me home?

1 Tell egghead I said hi.  If you see him.	If I see him.

1 Hey, what do you want to do?  Grow a beard?	Why not?
2 Well, let's get your first prom under the belt, okay?	What's a prom?
3 Ever go to church?

1 How's that dog of yours?  What was his name?	Eddie.
2 Yes.  Right.  Eddie.  How is he?	He's losing his teeth.

1 I hear you're a manicurist now -- got your own business and everything.  I'm glad you've stayed clean.	Like I had a choice with that anal-retentive Jon Archer rising my ass at the probation hearing.  At least he took an interest. You took off without leaving so much as a Post-it.
2 I'm not the same person you remember.

1 I was in a coma, Pollux. I still feel like shit.	Let me have a look.

1 Is someone there?	Eve, listen carefully.  The man you think is your husband -- isn't.

1 How's Loomis?	Apparently, fine.  He's coming into work.  That's the good news ...
2 Go on.	Castor's still alive --  Technically.  He's a turnip, on total life-support ...

1 -- Castor?	Not anymore.
2 It can't be.  It's impossible.	I believe the phrase Dr. Hoag used was "titanically remote."  Who knows?  Maybe the trauma of having my face cut off pulled me out.  Or maybe God really is on my side after all.  By the way, I know you don't get the papers in here.

1 You better be nice, Castor. You could get mighty lonely now that Pollux is gone.	Pollux is -- what?
2 Archer cut him a deal for turning state's evidence. He's free.	Walton, you have to let me see the warden --
3 Or what?  You'll have me fired?

1 You've got someone in your office.	Get rid of them.
2 The Admiral?

1 We gut the organization -- and rebuild it with more reliable friends.	Most of the current chiefs -- they must have pretty hefty prices on their heads.
2 All of them do.  We'll kill twelve birds with one bomb.  And we'll be rich.	Good, because I checked your salary -- and it bites.  How the everyday working-class stiff survives in today's economy is something I'll never ...

1 Why do I feel like I'm on a blind date?	They say love is blind. Do you think that's true?

1 I'll deal with her later.	Good.  Because I'm fed up.

1 Sorry, Jack.  I told Dee and the kids I'd be home by dinner.  You know, it being Christmas Eve and all.	Is that tonight?

1 Take you, for instance...	What about me?
2 You drink about sixteen Diet Cokes a day. Youre an excellent father, but you feel guilty about the time you spend away from home. You drink bourbon, but you offer your clients scotch...

1 This isnt my real life. Its just a glimpse...	Wheres my real dad?
2 I dont know...

1 Is it morning yet?	No, honey. Go back to sleep.

1 Cmon, Evelyn Thompsons got no class.  She doesnt marry Dr. Steve, the womans living in a trailer.	Hey, is that really necessary?
2 All Im saying it there isnt a guy in Union County who wouldnt give his left nut to be married to Kate...

1 You know you seem pretty relaxed for a guy who just had a gun pulled on him.	There's no way I was gonna die in that deli...  Let's just say I've been on a lucky streak lately.
2 A lucky streak, huh?

1 Might wanna fasten your seat belt, Jack...	What the hell is happening to me?!

1 Ive got kids, Im going home...	You know what the word glimpse means, J? Its by nature an impermanent thing.

1 I'm thinking I might walk tonight, Frank.	Nice night for it.  I'll have Louis send your car home.

1 Every one of these songs will remind you of me in a slightly different way...	All in one tape?
2 I also put side two of London Calling on there...

1 Christ...  Where the hell is the bathroom?	Funny, Jack.  Im laughing on the inside.

1 Thanks, Jack...	No, Im serious...youre really stunning...
2 This is good stuff, Jack, keep it coming...	I mean back in college, you were a very pretty girl, theres no question about that.  But this...  ...youve really grown into a beautiful woman...

1 Our life in a nutshell...	If you want to look at it that way...
2 How would you look at it?

1 I found it at an outlet store.  I know its a knock-off, but I think itll look great on you...	Zeena...

1 I think its good to be a little unsure about who you are.  Its very human.	But you always seem so certain.
2 Cmon, Jack, you think there arent mornings when I wake up and wonder what the hell Im doing in New Jersey...	Thats a big one for me, too.
3 My office is a dump, I answer my own phone...and youve seen my pay check.	Your pay check is a disgrace to pay checks.
4 I mean yes, I help people that need it...	I guess...some of them are probably faking.
5 God, sometimes I think it would be so nice not to have to stretch ground beef or maybe drive a car with a CD player...

1 This place is a perk, Kate.	A perk for what?
2 A company called P.K. Lassiter and Associates Investment House uses it to attract new executives...

1 I'm sorry...	Dont worry about it, Jack...

1 Peter Lassiter...	Do I know you?
2 Not exactly. Ive seen you on CNBC.  You look taller in real life...

1 It's Christmas Eve, Jack.	So we'll get egg nog.

1 You don't know what it's like out there.  Walking around like some kind of circus freak.  People staring, whispering --	I wouldn't know anything about that.
2 I mean...	Tell me.  When you grew up in Brooklyn, how many astronauts did you know?  You went your own way then.  You didn't listen to people.  So why start now...?

1 What about his first born?	Ben, the money's not important.  We could <u>save lives</u>.

1 You go through something like this, makes you appreciate having the right woman in your life.	Yeah, you and Debbie and perfect --
2 Reed, I'm not talking about Debbie.

1 Time for <u>your</u> lesson, Vic.  Chem 101: what happens when you <u>supercool</u> hot metal...?  Ben...	Got it, teach.

1 No more cracks about how I look.	Hey, I'm Mr. Sensitivity now.  Clear the way, wide load coming through.

1 Reed said it'd be weeks till --	He <u>also</u> said we'd avoid that storm in space.  And we know how that turned out.

1 <u>Where is Reed</u>?	Victor must've taken him.

1 Twenty?  From outside the place looks a lot taller.	Oh, it is.

1 You're hot!	So are you!
2 I mean, you feel a little feverish.	I've never felt better in my life. When do you get off work?
3 My shift ends at four, but I couldn't --	Meet me at 4:01, top of the run. That'll give you a minute to freshen up.

1 Uh, we call my sister the invisible girl...the Invisible Girl.	<u>Girl</u>...?!

1 Our numbers are through the roof.  The IPO's tracking at fifty, sixty a share.  The bank's five times oversubscribed --	It's not just the money.  I could make money in my sleep.
2 Then what is it?	History, Leonard.  <u>History</u>. Everything else is conversation...  How's the other matter?

1 Funny how things turn out, isn't it?	Hilarious.

1 You're, you've, I mean, how have you bee--	Never better.

1 It has to be the cloud.  It's fundamentally altered our DNA.	Let's not jump to conclusions, we need a <i>massive amount of evidence</i> before making that leap.

1 There were a lot of variables to consider --	No.  There weren't.  There was <u>you</u>. And <u>me</u>.  No variables, no math.  It was actually the simplest thing in the world.  But your head got in the way... like it always does.

1 You always talked about how you liked the kind of man who could approach you...speak his mind.  One who wasn't afraid to tell you what he wanted.	I did.  I did, Reed...but I wanted <u>you</u> to be that man.

1 Victor, I'm sorry I --	Just <u>find</u> him.

1 Benes' natural defenses. White Corpuscles -- Antibodies. Once you begin to grow -- and become a menace to the body -- you'll trigger them off... MICHAELS With all the unknown factors in the body, I still say risking five lives for one is something we should reconsider --	We understand your concern, but we've made our decision, Doctor. Any questions? Anybody?

1 Another delay... With only forty-two minutes left.	It'll be close -- but there's still a margin of safety.
2 Let's find what the devil's holding them up!  Contact the Proteus!

1 Wish I knew why.	Tell him where he fits in, will you? I've got a few things to check out.

1 Oh yes, great. The only problem is, he can't remember what he came to tell us.	Can't remember?... What do you mean?
2 He's blanked out on that one particular point.

1 Wouldn't it be quicker if we all helped?	Yes, there's no time to spare. And those fibers can be quite tenacious.

1 That'll teach you where to keep your hand.	Now I know...

1 If you had a transistor about this size and power output, and a thin enough wire --  -- could you piece it together?	No, it requires such absolute precision --
2 A surgeon might...	Oh yes, I'm sure Dr. Duval could. If we had the parts.
3 I've got a source. All I have to do is tap it.

1 We can't take a second more.	Captain -- head in the d1rection of the flow and drift with it.

1 Only to the naked eye.  Those corpuscles -- carrying oxygen -- give the stream its color. But the rest of the plasma's very much like sea water. An ocean of life...	Quite a piece of plumbing.

1 You said there was a quick way out!	What about Dr. Michaels?
2 It's too late!

1 At this size, I would certainly think so.	If those Corpuscles can take on air, no reason why we can't.  All we have to do is hook up the snorkel to that air chamber you were talk1ng about, and when Benes inhales, there should be plenty of pressure to force the oxygen into the tank.  How's that sound to you, Skipper?

1 Looks like somebody declared war.	Just what it is. Antibodies, destroying Bacteria -- or any other foreign invader that threatens the System.

1 Atomic fuel?	Nothing you could see with the naked eye. But there's a microscopic radio-active particle inside.

1 Yes, there is.	Could I run a tube through that Wall, without harming Benes?

1 We could never fight that current it's physically impossible.	Then don't drift down further.
2 I'll do what I can.

1 Just in town on business. Just in and out. Ha ha! A little of the old in-and-out!	Wuddya do?  Carl looks around.
2 Have ya been to the Celebrity Room before? With other, uh, clients?	I don't think so. It's nice.
3 Yeah, well, it depends on the artist. You know, Jose Feliciano, ya got no complaints. Waiter!

1 She started shrieking, you know.	Jezhush.

1 Well, he never done this before, but seein' as it's special circumstances and all, he says I can knock one hunnert off that TruCoat.	One hundred! You lied to me, Mr. Lundegaard. You're a bald-faced liar!

1 Where you girls from?	Chaska.

1 No, see, I don't need a finder's fee, I need - finder's fee's, what, ten percent, heck that's not gonna do it for me. I need the principal.	Jerry, we're not just going to give you seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars.

1 ...You're the owner here, Mr. Lundegaard?	Naw, I... Executive Sales Manager.
2 Well, you can help me. My name's Marge Gunderson -	My father-in-law, he's the owner.
3 Uh-huh. Well, I'm a police officer from up Brainerd investigating some malfeasance and I was just wondering if you've had any new vehicles stolen off the lot in the past couple of weeks - specifically a tan Cutlass Ciera?

1 Yah!	Jerome Lundegaard?
2 Yah!	This is Reilly Deifenbach at GMAC. Sir, I have not yet received those vehicle IDs you promised me.
3 Yah!  I... those are in the mail.	Mr. Lundegaard, that very well may be. I must inform you, however, that absent the receipt of those numbers by tomorrow afternoon, I will have to refer this matter to our legal department.
4 Yah.	My patience is at an end.
5 Yah.	Good day, sir.
6 ...Yah.

1 You're sayin' that we put in all the money and you collect when it pays off?	No, no. I - I'd, I'd - pay you back the principal, and interest heck, I'd go - one over prime -

1 Where is everybody?	Well - it's cold, Margie.

1 How we doin' on that vehicle?	No motels registered any tan Ciera last night. But the night before, two men checked into the Blue Ox registering a Ciera and leavin' the tag space blank.
2 Geez, that's a good lead. The Blue Ox, that's that trucker's joint out there on I-35?	Yah. Owner was on the desk then, said these two guys had company.
3 Oh, yah?

1 ...I'm sorry... I shouldn't a done this... I thought we'd have a really terrific time, and now I've...	It's okay...
2 You were such a super lady...  and then I... I been so lonely...	It's okay, Mike...

1 Whose car?	My car! My car! Tan Ciera!
2 Don't go in! Wait for back-up!

1 I love you, Margie.	I love you, Norm.

1 You are a moron.	I'm afraid I have to insist you leave.

1 We need to talk.	Okay.  Where to begin?  With your constant absenteeism?  With your unpresentable appearance?  You're up for review...
2 I Am Jack's Complete Lack of Surprise.

1 I... I don't know.  I guess... when people think you're dying, they really listen, instead...	-- Instead of just waiting for their turn to speak.
2 Yeah.

1 How did you find me?	The forwarding number.  I haven't seen you at any support groups.
2 That's the idea -- we split them.	You haven't been going to yours.
3 I found a new one.	Really?
4 It's for men.	Like testicular cancer?
5 Look, this is a bad time...	I've been going to debtor's anonymous.  You want to see some truly fucked up people?
6 I'm just on my way out...	Me too.  I got a stomach full of Xanax.  I took what was left of a bottle.  Might've been too much.

1 Make sure.	Okay.  Okay, I'm sure.
2 You feel nothing?	Nothing.

1 Marla...	Your whacked-out, bald freaks hit me with a fucking broom.  I thought they were going to break my arm.
2 I'm sorry, I...	The were burning their fingertips with lye.  The stink was unbelievable.
3 Marla... I need to talk to you.  It's going to take a tremendous act of faith on your part for you to hear me out.	Here comes an avalanche of bullshit.

1 I'm not paying this back.  I consider it "asshole tax."	Yes, fine.  Just, get on.  Stay away a couple of weeks, at least.

1 Tonight, we're going to open the green door -- the heart chakra...	I wasn't really dying, I wasn't host to cancer or parasites; I was the warm little center that the life of this world crowded around.
2 ...And you open the door and you step inside.  We're inside our hearts.  Now, imaging your pain as a white ball of healing light.  That's right, the pain itself is a ball of healing light.

1 What do you do, Tyler?	What do you want me to do?
2 I mean -- for a living.	Why?  So you can say, "Oh, that's what you do." -- And be a smug little shit about it?

1 ... Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.	He farted on meringue; he sneezed on braised endive; and, with creme of mushroom soup, well...
2 Go ahead.  Say it.	You get the idea.

1 "I am Joe's Lungs."  It's written in first person.  "Without me, Joe could not take in oxygen to feed his red blood cells."  There's a whole series -- "I am Joe's Prostate."	"I get cancer, and I kill Joe."

1 If you ever say anything about me or about what happens here in this house, to her or anyone -- I will find out.  And you'll never see me again.  Promise me.	Okay.
2 Promise you won't.	Yes, I promise.
3 Promise?	I said I promise!
4 That was three times you promised.

1 Listen to me.  You have to consider the possibility that God doesn't like you, he never wanted you.  In all probability, He hates you.  This is not the worst thing that can happen...	It isn't... ?
2 We don't need him...	We don't... ?

1 I feel sick.	Imagine how he feels.

1 What are you talking about?	Nothing.

1 No!  This isn't true.  We... we were around other people, together, both of us...	You never talked to me in front of anyone else.
2 Wrong, wrong -- what about the car crash... the two guys in the backseat?	What about them?  They're lunatics.
3 You took me to the house.	The house is rented in your name.
4 You have jobs.	Night jobs -- while you were sleeping.
5 What about Marla?	What about Marla?
6 She's... you... you're fucking her.	Um, well... technically, no.

1 Ask me nicely.	Defuse the bomb, please.
2 Defuse the bomb?	Yes.

1 Why are you going with this, Ikea- boy?	It's the only way to get rid of you...

1 S-S-Stuff.	"Stuff."  Were the mid-terms hard?

1 The second one just dies.  A 16 year old kid.	I hope you're ready for this.

1 What did you see?	I was dead.  And came back to life. An EEG machine.  Where's Eugene?

1 I'm not sure I understand.	Being alive after our time caused an outward ripple - a rift in Death's design.

1 Look, you weren't there.  It was weird.  She knew that log truck was gonna cause an accident, she knew.  Never mind.	I thought we were finished with this bullshit.  This is police work, not the psychic Hot Line.

1 Last July I dialed a wrong number and got a radio station by accident. They asked me what number means "good luck" in Jewish.	Eighteen.  And it's "Hebrew".
2 Anyway, I guessed it right and won these.

1 I didn't.  Until I was dispatched to clean up one of the Flight 180 survivors.	Clean up?  I don't...

1 Stop it, don't move him!	He can't breathe damn it.  I think his lung's collapsed!

1 Want me to drive?	No, I'm good.

1 Thanks, Dad.  I'll call you.	You have everything, Kimberly? Credit card, cell phone, AAA card?
2 Relax, Dad.  It's Daytona, not Mongolia.	Fix-A-flat?  Road flares? Sunblock?  Mace?

1 You're all certifiable, you know that?  I can't believe I've been listening to this crap.  Come on, Tim, let's go outside.	Jeez, Mom, stop trippin'.

1 That... him?	I think. But why'd they make him up like... Michael Jackson?
2 That's him, but... he's not here.

1 Those guys are probably fifteen minutes away.	No.. I mean, I don't have anything on me. This won't be safe.
2 Nothing is... anymore.

1 You're payin' for my trip, Browning!	I wish you were on the plane!

1 And then the cabin banged and the left side exploded. The the whole plane... blew up. It was so real. Exactly how everything goes.	Been on many planes that blew up, have you?

1 I'm sorry we broke in.	No harm. No foul.

1 SHUT UP, BILLY!	WE DON'T NEED THIS NOW!

1 Again.	Insertion.  Call in to base camp by TRANSAT.  Proceed to point Tango November for rendezvous with our ground contact.  Indigenous agent. Co Phuong Bao.  We've been over this three times.
2 You stopped.

1 Cocktail party.  Uh huh, right.  Let's saddle up.	Where's your stuff?

1 These guys look like they'd sell their mothers.	Sometimes they do.  They're river pirates.  Opium runners.
2 Pirates?  No kidding?

1 Gawd, you look awful.	You comin'?
2 Hold your pantyhose.  Here, gimme a hand.

1 Where's Nguyen now?  What city?	Huntington Beach, California.
2 It's nice there.  He's probably digging every minute.  Got a surfboard.  Breaking girls' hearts.	Nguyen is good boy.

1 Alternate LZ Zulu Sierra at 0500. It says "May have heat.  Don't be late.  All our love."	Let's get that tent down!

1 How long before you're fully on line?	Couple hours.  Let me buy you a coffee.

1 Who're you?	American.  Come to get you out.
2 Man, you are one scary-looking motherfucker!	Can you walk?
3 I could a couple of days ago.  Gonna be... stiff.

1 Let's do it.	Keep it clean, Rambo, or I'll nail your hide to the shed.
2 You got it, sir.

1 ...My mother calls every week. Like a recurring nightmare. "So, have you met anyone?"..."No mom".. "So what's going to happen?"... "I don't know Mom"... I only thank God I moved out.	I can't believe you lived with her for that long. If I had to live with my mother, I'd stab myself six times.
2 I think some people are meant to be alone.  Maybe I was a man in a former life and I used women for pleasure so now I'm paying for it - which would be fine, if I could just remember some of the pleasure parts... 	I don't understand you. What is the problem?
3 I don't feel like I make any impression on people... At office parties I spend my time re-arranging the hors d'oeuvres as people eat them, so the platters will always look full. I don't start conversations because I have no idea how to end them...I think I'm just meant to live in the background of things.	That's not true...You gotta ease up... Conversations have a life of their own. You gotta just go with it...We're having a lovely conversation.
4 I'm paying you.

1 Well, it's funny!  Whatta want from me?	It's not funny.  It's... sophomoric and mindless... and dumb.
2 Then why the hell do we watch all the time?	Because it makes me feel good to see how not funny it is and how America doesn't know the first thing about funny which makes it easier not being a famous funny TV celebrity because that would just mean that I'm not really talented.

1 Can I have my desk please.	Hello, I'd like to speak to Lydia?
2 Lydia?!  Lydia who!?	I don't know her last name... I'll be off in a second.
3 You're calling <u>Lydia</u> in <u>my</u> office. You must think I'm some dope.  You fuckin' bastard... You...  ... stay out all night long...	What... No... Lydia... I want to speak to... her name is Lydia... I...uh...
4 ... I don't get a friggin' phone call.  You stroll in here at noon.  I got... two people out sick.  Ya think I need this?  I Do Not Need This!	...<u>Forget it</u>... <u>Goodbye</u>!

1 It's so great to see you like this, honey... I can't tell you.	Thanks.
2 Ya know, I'm thinkin' -- with another income coming in, I would love to get a bigger place.

1 Parry?	He can't hear you.  Hi...I'm Dr. Weintraub....  I was on duty when they brought him in...I've been going over his record... He was brought in once before I understand...  ..."catatonic  stupor"...condition  rendered him non-verbal for a period of -...
2 Yeah so? The guy's beat up - he...he probably has a concussion or something, right?  He'll snap out of it?	I'm afraid not ... Then again, I'm not sure. The beating's bad but it's not the problem... It seems he's.. re-experiencing the catatonia... So, like before, he could snap out it in an hour or in thirteen months or thirteen years... ....I don't know. There's no way to tell.
3 But..How could that happen?	Well, it's not unusual in his case... Sometimes victims of tragedies are subject to the brain's replay system. The brain never loses anything - it just stores it up and waits. A person could actually re-experience the full effect of a tragedy, long after the event took place. Are you relatives?  Well, it doesn't matter. We'll take care of it. He'll have to be sent back to the same institution.. 
4 What if I was a relative?	You'd have the option to care for him at home but my advice is it wouldn't be the best thing for him. He needs hospital care. I just thought you could sign the release forms, but the city can do that. I wouldn't feel responsible in any way. There's really nothing you can do. I'm sorry.

1 Um...I've got to run. I've bee doing this all day.  Are you going to be all right?	Oh please!...I was born a Catholic in Brooklyn... I've been to hell and back.... I'll be fine...  ....Thanks...You're a gem.

1 Your name was picked.	Well, I don't understand.  What did you do -- did you pick my name out of a hat or... or... a list?
2 A list.	Well -- were there a lot of people in the room or just you or what?
3 Well there....  What's the difference?	Well, I mean... I don't know you... This has never... I've never won anything and... I don't have a VCR.
4 You get a VCR with the membership.  ... For a short time until you get your own.  Listen, why don't you come down to the store and you can check it out.  See if you're interested.	Did Phyllis in accounting tell you to call me?
5 <u>No!</u>  <u>I told you</u>! <u>You won a contest</u>!

1 This is it. I'm in hell. Damned to an eternity of idiotic conversation.	Great place huh?

1 Thanks... You can keep the doll.	Thanks a mill --  And I'll give you a buzz as soon as I hear from the people upstairs and we'll get this thing off the ground... Thanks for stopping by, Jack.  Give my love to the wife and kids.

1 Pretty impressive huh?...Don't let it scare you. I'll admit it's formidable but everything has it's weakness.	You can't just break into Langdon Carmichael's house. This man has done nothing.
2 O.K...let me explain this one more time...The Holly Grail is in -....	All right! Listen - please...don't start drooling or...rolling your eyes when I tell you this but - You shouldn't do this..There is no Holy Grail.
3 Of course there is, Jack. What do you think the Crusades were - a frat initiation? I don't think so...There has to be a Grail.	Look, you're only sort of insane, really. People like you can lead semi-normal lives. You could get a job...
4 I don't need a job. I have a quest.	I take it back - you're fucking deranged... And you're going to get yourself killed trying to get in there!
5 Tch. You are so sweet...Now I know why you're saying this. ...You're afraid I'm in danger and you're trying to protect me.	No. I think you're a moron and I don't want to get into trouble.

1 .....What are you doing?	Have you ever done any cloudbusting? You lie on your back and you concentrate on the clouds...and you try yo break them apart with your mind. It's wild.

1 Unhand that degenerate - you adolescent ass of a one balled donkey!	It's just a bum...You know, there's enough in here for the two of you.
2 Ha, ha, ha, ha rubbish...now begone...before somebody drops a house on you!...

1 ...I..uh..I get to read some of the books but mostly I..just calculate production costs from first edition hard cover publication to paperback. After paperback it's basically someone else's problem.	It sounds exciting.
2 Why does it sound exciting? There's absolutely nothing exciting about it.

1 Well, id'n that nice.	It's ridiculous! I'm sitting here, listening to some asshole cracker compare his life to mine!

1 I'm tryin', baby, so don't start gettin' mad now.	No, I'm not mad at you, hand. It'll be all right. Just spot and follow through...

1 What?	I'll tell you...  ... l-a-t-e-r.

1 Bobby...	I can't talk to you right now, leave me alone...

1 Hey, mack!	Shut up.  You have bread, don't you, and a toaster of some kind?

1 Tea.	Would you tell her Bobby's here?

1 I'd rather drive up myself and... maybe go into Canada after... And I can't stay long, Tita, probably a week, at the most.	I know.

1 Oh no... Why? What is it? The way I look?	No, I don't really think you're a freak.
2 I probably am, but I don't care. I mean, I wasn't that blessed to begin with, and when would I have had time to make any improvements...	What about Carl and Catherine? Is he just coaching her, or what?
3 Constantly. Night and day. And unless I get up before the birds, I can't get in any practice time for myself...	Uhm hmm.
4 Actually, it's very admirable, the way she works. She'll probably be enormously successful, because she's attractive as well, not that that's so important in music, but...	You're attractive, Tita. If you just did a little more with yourself...
5 Like what?	Well, if you just maybe did something with your hair, or...
6 Oh, let's not talk about my hair, it does what it wants to, and anyway, who cares, I want to talk about you...	There's nothing to say, Tita...

1 You're leaving?	Yeah. I said a week, and I've overstayed myself...
2 You were going without saying goodbye?	I didn't want to say goodbye to anyone.
3 But what about me?	I'll say goodbye to you, Tita.

1 I mean, how could you not play anymore? That's so strange to me...	I have played a few times. Here and there. As a matter of fact, I was once a rehearsal pianist for a Las Vegas musical revue.
2 You don't call that music, though.	Of course I do. It's music. You know...

1 No, don't do that...	Shut up...

1 No. It's useless, Robert. It wouldn't work, not ever...	Just give me a chance, will you?
2 I'm trying to be delicate with you, but you're not understanding me. It's not just because of Carl, or my music, but because of you...  I mean, what would it come to? If a person has no love for himself, no respect, no love for his work, his family, his friends, something... How can he ask for love in return? I mean, why should he ask for it?

1 See? There's nothing wrong with the way I walk. Now where are we?	At game, Carl.

1 You know, just after I came back off tour with the Betenthaller Quartet, Dad, myself and Herbert had a summit conference about you...	Oh, my, "a summit conference." I wonder where I was, polishing silver behind the coal bin.
2 I don't know where you were, penis envy.	I hope I didn't hear that.
3 At any rate, Dad wanted to hire a private detective to ferret you out, and I said, "What for?" Whatever the hell he's doing, even if it's a completely wasteful escapade, it's entirely his business. Simple as that...

1 Mass production is what does it.	What do you mean "mass"... I have to come out and tell you, you're not that clean, either.
2 Wait a minute. I'm not that neat, maybe, but I am clean.	Well, you're not that bad, but some people... I mean, people's homes, just filth. I've been in people's homes...
3 In my personal observation, I think that more people are neat than are clean...	In my personal thing, I don't see that. I'm seeing more filth. A lot of filth. What they need to do every day, no, once in a while, is a cockroach thing, where they spray the homes. And uh... can you imagine, if their doors were painted a pretty color, and they had a pot outside, with...
4 Yeah, it could be adorable...	And they picked up! I mean, it wouldn't be filthy, with Coke bottles and whiskey, and those signs everywhere...

1 I told you, no. I'm not that type.	Then I want you to go to whoever's sayin' that and tell them to stop.
2 Alright.

1 See, I got you, you are so scared. I don't believe that you kissed no girls. That you got three girls and that you faithful and this and that.	I did.
2 Well, you know I'm standin' here and you say I look good?	I kissed those girls.
3 No you didn't, you ain't provin'it.	I aint gotta prove nothin' to no girl, 'cause I got it like dat.
4 Oh, 'cause you got it like dat?

1 Amanda is Eddie's cousin.	Eddie from Compost?
2 No, Baruch.

1 You looking for somebody?	Wha'?
2 You here to see somebody?	Yeah.
3 Who?	A girl named Amanda.
4 What she look like?	She's like this high, dark hair, skinny
5 Yo, that's my girl.	She didn't say she had no man.
6 I suggest you turn around and go back to where you came from.

1 Never heard of him. Thanks anyway.	You mean her.
2 What?	Sally Ann Cavanaugh. Oh wait, she couldn't work in your office, she's not from around here.
3 Oh, thanks.

1 After I shoot you, I stick the knife in my arm, then place it in your dead hand. Self-defense. We don't do this very much anymore... but we have. Got rid of a lot of minorities that way.	My God, you're serious.
2 Ask anybody.	Can I ask anybody now?

1 Jerry, you're simply going to have to trust me. I've got a foolproof way to get rid of this guy and now you're jeopardizing everything.	Your 'foolproof' way is going to land my ass on the front page while you're basking in Rio.

1 Is there anything particular you're looking for?	My associates did a biopsy on this man recently.  He's supposed to have a melanoma, or a carcinoma, some kind of noma. Hmmm. I can't seem to find any record of it.
2 Well, if he had one, it would certainly be in here.  Wait. Here it is. Yep. Surgical removal of two moles. Tissue was benign.	That's it?
3 That's it.	This was last month. So Alan Stanwyk does not have cancer.
4 I guess not.	He'll be so relieved.

1 He doesn't read my stuff well.  'Sally Ann and Alan were married four years ago and never divorced, making Stanwyk a bigamist even in Utah. Stanwyk is also traveling with three million dollars in cash, the result of Gail Stanwyk's conversion of Boyd Aviation stock. Mrs. Stanwyk believed the money was to be used to purchase property in Utah, but it wasn't; a fact that can be confirmed by realtor James Swarthout of Provo.'  That was stupid, Alan.	I'd have been long gone.
2 Ahem.  'Sally Ann can confirm all this when the police pick her up at the Airport Marriott.'

1 Has he?	Boy, what the hell's the matter with you?
2 Then he has.	Course he has. That's his wife.

1 Fat Sam is turning state's evidence.	What's that?
2 He wrote me a nice deposition. He says he just received the drugs. You did the selling.	I didn't sell nothing! I didn't sell nothing! I just carried the drugs from the Chief to Sam.
3 Sure you did.	Fletch, I never sold nothing.
4 Twenty years.

1 LAX. Go to the Pan Am desk. There will be a ticket waiting for you.	Where am I going?
2 Rio. Flight 306. Departs at eleven PM.	They serve dinner on the flight?
3 It'll be a first class-ticket. I'm sure you'll enjoy the ride. I would recommend staying down there at least a year, Mr. Nugent.	You've certainly thought this out, haven't you?
4 I am not someone who leaves a great deal to chance, Mr. Nugent.	You sure those doors will be open?
5 Yes. All you provide are the gloves, the passport, and the aim. I'll take care of everything else.	The gun, the money, the tickets, and the dying.
6 That's right.	You sure got the hard part.
7 What do you say, Mr. Nugent? You'll be doing me and my family a great service.

1 My hero.	Nothing to it.

1 Stay!  I must be having an off day. I'm really a fabulous player.	I have this effect on lots of women.
2 I bet you do.	Say, the reason I asked about Alan is that I bumped into him this morning and you know what I can't figure out?
3 Alan's in Utah.	I can't figure out why I went to Utah for the morning.
4 Okay. I'm delighted to have someone to talk to, and you're very cute, so I'm very flattered, but I'm also very married so you may as well forget -- You are trying to hit on me, aren't you?	I'm such a heel. How'd you guess?
5 If I had a nickel for every one of Alan's flyboy buddies who tried to pick me up, I'd be a rich woman.	You are a rich woman.
6 See what I mean?

1 'I've been so many places in my life and times. I've sung a lot of songs, I've made some bad rhymes...'	It's amazing.
2 'I've acted out my life on stages, with ten thousand people watching...'	Your bone structure, shoulders, neck...
3 'But we're alone now, and I'm singing this song for you.'	Just like Alan. It's freaky.
4 Can I ask you a question?	Depends on the question.
5 Are you still in love with Alan?	No.  I mean, 'no you can't ask me that.' I mean, ask me something else.
6 Why'd you let me in?	Because I'm bored. Oh, that sounds terrible, doesn't it. I'm sorry. If it makes you feel any better, I also let you in because I'm hungry.
7 Thanks, I feel much better. Listen, if you're so bored, why didn't you go to Utah with Alan?	Utah is not exactly a cure for boredom.
8 Good point.	Oh, listen to me. I've never even been there and look what I say about it. Anyway, I know there'd be nothing for me to do. I don't even know anybody there.
9 What about his parents?	He never sees them and I never met them.
10 How come?

1 What's wrong, Gail?	I decided I was going to tell my husband about you today.
2 No.	But first I called the Hall of Records in Provo. They checked on the deed. You're telling the truth. A minute later Alan came in the room and asked me why I was shaking.

1 Your call is come through.	Far out.  Larry? It's Fletch.  Well, it's not 'Fat Sam's', but... any port in a storm.  Oh, tell Frank I need a couple of months. The fifty grand's lasting longer than I thought.

1 Now, Irwin, try to follow me. You can't run the ad and then not run the story.	Why not? Oh shit... really?

1 Oh, Margie, sorry, Frieda lost the number of Alan's realtor in Provo. Can you give it to me real quick?	Jim Swarthout?
2 Yeah.

1 Now that we've broken the ice...	I need you to find my little sister. She goes by the name Zuzu...
2 Zuzu Petals.  You want me to rescue her from the gorgeous hell that is L.A.	But how did you know?  Here, take this picture...

1 What cheap shit... hey, waiter!	We invested in these factories. In Vancouver.
2 Hold that thought.  Are we being shot at?

1 Thanks for the promotion, man.	No prob...

1 Sorry, Jazz.  After this, I'll throw a burger down your throat, okay?	You're a fucking gentleman.  What do you want from me?
2 This Colleen Sutton woman I'm with. If she flees me to go powder her whatever, I need you to keep tabs...

1 Hello, Ford...	What are you doing at the office? You wouldn't believe what I've gone through tonight... I'm calling from the Mega Beta Pogo Sorority.

1 Zuzu Petals!  Zuzu Petals!  Yes! Who killed Bobby Vomit?  Who killed Johnny Crunch?  Why do people want you so goddamn bad?	I don't know.  I'm so scared. Help me.

1 Why are you depressed?  You get in all the clubs, you never pay cover...	Stop.  We still got serious detective stuff to do, but we've been up all night so we should hit the sack for...
2 What a perv...

1 Suck a dick, I left my purse...	As Clark Gable said to Ava Gardner in Mogambo:  'Fuck the purse, we're gonna die-e-e.'
2 Reality-reality-reality -- Outrageous building, huh?	Ye-ah.

1 So, Zuzu.  Are you okay?	Yeah, Ford.  I'm okay.

1 So, did you find my dad?	Well, I got some good news and some bad news.
2 Yeah, go on...	Good news is that yeah, I found him.  The bad news is...

1 I want you to say that you're the biggest sissy in the whole wide world.	<u>I'm.  The.  Biggest.  Sissy.  In</u>. <u>The.  Wide.  World</u>.
2 Okay.  'B-y-e!

1 Actually you're a bit off in the motivation department... I mean, revenge is so... Bronson.  Wait, where's the third C.D.?  How could you come here without proof? It's a three piece set here!  A computer disc from Colleen, Bobby's computer disc, and Johnny's computer disc.  Together they make, oh fucking forget it!	Yeah, yeah, I know the third one unscrambles the high bits and the low bits.  Shit, just start torturing me, man.  I didn't even know Johnny had a disc and I can't deal with any 'Don't play games with me, Mr. Fairlane' bullshit.
2 Don't play games... ugh.  Did you say you don't have the third... ugh.  I'm not going to torture <u>you</u>, Ford.

1 I'm still the king!	Julian, you're fired.

1 What about you?  Can you stand a toss?	I'm clean.
2 You don't use shit?	No. 

1 Calm down -- Henri!  You must trust me -- this is an extremely complicated situation to which there is a simple solution if you do exactly what I tell you.  It's worth more money to you.	Goodbye.

1 Are you sure it is dead?	I'm going to put them on the cat.
2 That's a relief.

1 I got no music!	Fake it.

1 I got this little chick I'm tryin' to hit on.  She's about 20, 21... I take her to Jilly's last night and she's tellin' me about how she wants to settle down one day, get married... I says, "Hey, this is 1971, baby, I'm just a dirty old man lookin' to score with some pussy."	Strike out, eh?
2 Yeah.  In the late innings.  Ya look like a night's sleep wouldn't kill ya.	A piece of ass wouldn't kill me.
3 When ya go back on?	Morning.  Sometime.
4 Whyn't ya stretch out on the pool table for a couple hours.  The kid comes in at six will wake ya.  A couple eggs and a beer is cheaper than keepin' a dog around the joint.

1 Come on -- one drink.  Whatta you say?	Drink this.
2 Whip it out.

1 I'm goin' check on this address in the Bronx, if you're bullshitting me, it's your ass.	Tell everybody we'll be back in an hour.
2 We're goin' now!  Goodbye.

1 This fella Nicoli's got a record in France, Walter.  He's wanted for questioning in the murder of a French cop.	I say we keep sittin' on Boca.

1 What am I, a shmuck?  What's the hurry?  He could see a couple of shows and visit the top of the Empire State Building.	Joel, don't jerk me.  I spent a lot o' time settin' this one up.

1 Frank.  We gotta go back.  Frank...	Stay with me, Gib.  We're gonna do this.
2 I should'a been a fucking mailman.

1 Butch called.	Did he?
2 He did.	It was under control, Bud.  Butchy's just getting tight in his old age.
3 Nothing wrong with old age, Frank...long as you get there.

1 Then you gotta hide it somewhere. Somewhere where nobody's gonna find it...for 29 years!  Put it under the loose floorboard by the window!	I gotcha, I gotcha Chief!

1 Frank, this is not the time to be worried about covering up if you had a thing with this girl.	He's not gonna stop, Satch.  He's gonna keep on...
2 Are you listening to me?  You're in a world of shit.  An eye witness has you outside the dead girl's apartment.  We got your prints all over the place.  Plus the fucking driver's license, Frank.  You gotta give me something here. Something I can believe.

1 Uh, hello?	WB2YKXB, who've I got?
2 Name's John.

1 29 years...?	My dad's name was Frank Patrick Sullivan, he was a fire fighter and a die-hard Mets fan.  And every night when I went to bed he sang to me...  Take me out to the ball game, take me out with the crowd...

1 No, not yet.	Too busy playin' ball, huh?
2 Nah, I gave it up.

1 Right here, Chief.  Sorry I lost you last night.  Damn thing keeps cutting out.	Dad...Dad... There's... I need to...
2 Are you alright"?	Something happened, something...
3 What?  Johnny, what's wrong?	It's Mom.
4 What?  What is it?	She's not here.
5 Whatta you mean she's not here?	She...she died.  It's like it just happened.
6 She just died, your mother just died?	No Dad, it happened a long time ago, a long time ago for me.

1 Hang on a sec, John.	You there?

1 Dad, what the hell is going on?	Just a minute, John...okay?  Don't go away.

1 John.  John, you all right?	Longbranch...?
2 What?

1 She makes ten.	Ten?  No.  I remember this case.  Three. He killed three women.
2 What're you talking'?  You know better than anybody, John.  You've read this file a thousand times.

1 So how'd you like LION KING?	Oh, I loved it.  I wish you'd gone.
2 I know.  I'm sorry.  Work.	You work too hard, John.
3 Look who's talking.

1 Hell-	You have the right to remain silent.  If you give up that right...

1 What're you gonna do?	Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.

1 That was the best yet.  Was it you... me... or the hammock?	I vote for me.
2 I vote for the hammock.

1 What's the matter?!	Nothin'.  I was just foolin' around.
2 Don't do that to me!

1 This door was open just a minute ago, wasn't it?	What?
2 Nothing.

1 You know him?	Sort of.

1 I don't see anything.	Keep looking.

1 Why do you do these stupid things?!	I have to.
2 You don't "have to."	I just want you to like me.
3 I do like you.  But not when you act like a jerk.	Being a jerk is better than being nothing.
4 I never said you were "nothing".	You don't to say it.  I can tell.
5 You're wrong.

1 Oh, jeez.	That's it.  We're driving this baby back to town... in reverse.

1 Once we nail Roy, that's it. Victory is ours.	This is taking forever.  I'm starving.
2 That's your problem, Larry. That's why your sales are always below quota.  Your instinct to eat is stronger than your instinct to win.	My ass.
3 Yeah, that's fat too.

1 Rick.  Keep and eye on our wacko kid.  I'll be back as soon as I can.	Daddy, what is going on?
2 And make sure my daughter stays put...  ...She's grounded.

1 Sorry, Megan.  Not this time.	Wait a minute. I just...
2 I thank you for getting me out. But I gotta finish what I started.

1 I can't believe no one called back.  I better...	Who ya calling?

1 Jason is alive.  We dug up his body.  I was gonna cremate it and...	Hold it.  Whoa... What's your name, son?
2 Tommy Jarvis.  We gotta do something.  He's even more powerful now that...

1 With extreme car, for God's sake. If that kid is with her, there's every good chance he'll do something crazy.	Please don't do anything crazy.

1 Steven...	I'm here.
2 I'm scared.  I'm very scared.

1 Hello...	June the 19th.

1 Jessica, I'm so sorry.  I...I wanted to have this cleaned up before you got here.	That's all right.  I was just...

1 Well?	I'm sorry.  I have to bring you to a cell.
2 Are you crazy?!	I know, I know, I'm sorry but the Sheriff is just berserk right now. C'mon.

1 Have you seen Tamara?	No. And I'm not losing any sleep over it.
2 But she might be in trouble...	So what else is new?  Look Eva, you're asking the wrong dude to feel sorry for Tamara Mason. Wise up -- it's not hip to be her friend.
3 I don't care about being hip anymore.

1 Well...how do you feel?	Ask me in about five minutes.

1 What's that?	The fire alarm...

1 Let's go -- we're running two minutes late.	Charles, there's someone else coming along too.

1 There must be a phone around here somewhere.	A wonderful choice of places to dock a boat, Mr. Robertson.

1 Whatever you've been...imagining... has nothing to do with Jason Voorhees.  I want you to be safe, Rennie. That's all I care about.	I'm not staying in my room, Uncle Charles.
2 This isn't a request.

1 I had a skiing accident in high school, broke my left leg. It took three winters before I would even look at the snow again...but the solution kept eluding me.  I finally took lessons. I've never broken a bone since.	It's not that simple.
2 Maybe not. But you're not telling me everything, are you?	Whenever I get near the water, I see this young boy drowning. He tries to pull me down with him.

1 I don't know...we've gone off course or something...	What do you mean???

1 I wrapped my sandwiches in tinfoil. I ate and drove. I had one of those big checkered cabs.	You are going where?
2 Crosstown.	Very bad today.

1 How is Lillian? I haven't seen her.	She wants a divorce.
2 Don't talk like that.	It's over, finished and done with.
3 That sounds so final. But are we really surprised?	I'm completely stunned. I don't want this to happen.
4 But didn't we know it would happen?	Don't needle me, Elliot. Tell me how bad you feel. We're suppose to feel bad together. This is what friends do.
5 Joanna Bourne. So rich and crisp. This woman lets you touch her body? You put your hands on her personal parts?

1 In other words why should we suffer silently at this kind of abuse? The man is out there ruining lives.	It's your best play, Nicky.
2 He'll hate it.	He'll kill it. He'll write a review so devastating it will shatter your career and cause the most unmanageable psychic grief. What happens to your apartment on the East River? Your house in Connecticut, where you watch things grow.

1 I'm proud of this play. It's so different from anything you've done.	This is how we've managed to last.
2 We're able to surprise each other.	In and out of bed.
3 Because we're completely mismatched.	We don't even like each other, do we?

1 And you blame me. It's because we never talk. Let's talk.	I have a class. I'm late.
2 Can we talk later? Will you be at the party?	I'm not sure.

1 I have this thing where I have to know a person is being honest with me before, you know, I can feel completely free to be myself.	We're strangers in the night. The last thing we want is honesty.
2 What do we want?	Mystery. Deception.
3 Deception isn't something I personally consider sexy.	What's sexy?
4 Knowing who a person is. Down deep.	Even if the truth about a person is sad or depressing or shocking?
5 You won't even tell me your name. What's shocking about a name?

1 Great game. Red Sox are winning.	They're always winning. Until they lose.

1 It's a constant shock to me, how small this place is. How did we do it? Five people in these little rooms.	Get yourself something to eat.

1 You're a family man, Frankie?	Wife and daughter. My father's still alive. He outlives me, starting tonight. Because the Mets just tied the score. It was only a matter of time, wasn't it?
2 An how many years does it take a person to make his family safe and secure and happy, and then in one dumb moment, what does he do?	I don't know Toyota. What does he do?
3 And the people he hurts the most are the people who love him. Despite who he is and what he does for a living. We're always saying we want to take control of our lives. You don't want to take control. You want to lose control. Jesus knows it.

1 Then they lost?	Why does it matter?
2 If they lost tonight, they'll lose tomorrow. It's all over.	Why do you care?
3 They're my team.	No. They're not your team. They're my team.

1 What do you mean?	To go to the theater. Wears I don't know what. Make-up, padding.
2 Why?	Because he is so deeply hated by so many people in the business.

1 What? Come on, Paisley.	Our Steven not only disguises himself.
2 Yes.	He goes to the theater armed.

1 Sora was sent to tell me I -- I must rake and cover the latrine.	Everyone takes his turn.
2 It is the work of untouchables.	In this place there are no untouchables -- and no work is beneath any of us!
3 I am your wife.	All the more reason.

1 Enough.	One more.

1 I'm sure your legs are quite as handsome as mine.	Ah, but my puritanism runs the another way. I'm far too modest for such a display.

1 Maybe I'm wrong... maybe we're not ready yet. In South Africa the numbers were small...	The Government's afraid, and they don't know what to do. But they're more afraid of terrorists than of you. The Viceroy has agreed to your release if you will speak for non- violence.
2 I've never spoken for anything else.

1 It's beautiful.	Even as a boy I thought so.

1 We hope you intend to join us in the struggle for Home Rule, Mr. Gandhi.	I --

1 We need your help!	There is nothing I can give.

1 Hm. Of course it is not quite that simple.	Somehow I expected not.

1 Bapu, for me, and the rest,  if that is what you want, we will accept it. But out there  already there is rioting because Hindus fear you are going to give too much away.	If you did this, no one could control it. No one.

1 How much extra?	It would be five thousand more.

1 The skin flake was found in Michael's Restaurant. The employees are all accounted for.	A customer?  Does this Michael's cater to misfits?
2 No.  But one or two "borrowed ladders" have shown up there in the past.

1 We believe we have a suspect.	What a relief.
2 This unaccountable specimen was found in the south wing corridor.

1 What's wrong with it?	I think I'd better choose the menu.  After all, you're learning how to be me, I'm not learning how to be <i>you</i>.
2 Suit yourself.	Listen, I don't want you to think I'm ungrateful --I know you and that little broker--what do you call him?
3 German.	You're both going to a lot of trouble--  Maybe you can con somebody into believing you're me to get your foot in the door--but once you're inside, you're on your own.  I'm sure you're sincere...  ...but I was being groomed for something like this myself.  Even without the accident I don't think I would have made it.  My point is--how the hell do <i>you</i> expect to pull this off?

1 Let's get out of here.	You're right, there's more atmosphere where you're going.

1 And keep your lashes on your lids where they belong.  How could you be so careless?	I'm sorry.  I think I was crying.

1 I have your samples ready.	Have you forgotten?  I don't need any samples where I'm going.
2 No, but you might need them when you get back.

1 	That's the hair color in his profile?

1 Perhaps we ought to celebrate, Irene.	You celebrate, Jerome?

1 What happened?	You remember the '99 Chrysler LeBaron? It's the exact height of the front fender.  Looked right instead of left.
2 So you're not so smart after all.  I want you to know--if it ever came to it-- I'd be willing to get an ovum from the Egg Bank.  In fact, I'd <i>rather</i> use a donor egg--  --<i>if</i> it came to it.	But "if it came to it" then it couldn't have your--  --nose.  How perfect does your child have to be?
3 You hypocrite.  Do you think for one moment you'd be doing what you're doing if it wasn't for who you are--<i>what</i> you are?  Don't you get <i>any</i> satisfaction knowing that your children will be able to live to a ripe old age unless they do something foolish?	That's precisely what <i>scares</i>me--that they won't do anything <i>foolish</i> or <i>courageous</i> or <i>anything</i>--worth a Goddamn.

1 What are you doing?	I can't do this.
2 I told you, the government pays.  It's all taken care of.	No, you don't understand.  I <i>can't</i>.

1 Hello, McCoy.	Beynon.
2 News said two persons killed.

1 I'm sorry I was late... I got my hair done... the girl was slow.	It looks fine.

1 Wait... give me a minute.	Sure.

1 You know how I feel?	My mind's not on guessing games.

1 How long ago.	Fifteen minutes.
2 Sure?

1 That would be the first time.	When are you going to learn?
2 I did I killed a man.

1 Do what I tell you, it's not a game.	It's all a game, don't bother me.

1 You're crazy.	Get your clothes on, move your butt.

1 Three years ago I dynamited some fish at the reservoir.	Oh my God.
2 That little job cost me a hundred dollars... didn't even get to keep the fish.

1 How was that?	Just fine.
2 Where we go in1?	Mexico. I'd like to find a quiet place to cross.
3 Why not?

1 I don't think you have to worry much about Harold. He won't do anything.	That right?
2 You can trust him...	How long have you been married?
3 Two years.	Can he trust you?
4 That's what matters, isn't it?

1 What about the brakes?	Fine. Nowt wrong with them.
2 How'd it happen, then?	He was drunk. Drunk as a lord.
3 Was he?

1 Who paid you to see me off?	I can't Jack. How can I?
2 Yes you can.

1 It is. Honestly.	You bloody whore. Frank was too careful to die like that. Who killed him?
2 I don't know nothing.

1 Does Brumby get a kick out of that crap?	Especially when I play the lead.

1 You all right now?	Yeah.
2 You coming to South America?	No.

1 Said he'd heard you were up in town. Wondered if I knew where you was staying. Wanted to look you up. Old time's sake.	That's nice. What'd you tell him?
2 Nowt.	Good lad.

1 Ta.	I'll bet this one's seen some action.

1 Thorpey nearly died laughing.	That little shit!
2 What about Keith?	What about Keith?
3 What you going to do?	Pension him off.
4 You're a bastard.	What am I supposed to do?  I don't know where they've taken him. Do you?

1 Well, well. Small world, isn't it?	Very...  So, who you working for these days Eric?
2 Oh, I'm straight.  Respectable.	What are you doing? Advertising Martini?
3 Oh, you've been watching television.	Yeah,  Come off it, Eric. Who is it?

1 Not going, Jack?	I have to. Things to see to.
2 Of course, of course. Well, any time, just drop by.	Yeah, I'll do that.  Told you it wouldn't take long, didn't I?

1 What's that? A hundred?	That's right, Harry.
2 Your hundred, and another hundred.

1 They did.	They killed the goose.
2 They did.	And now...
3 We're stuck with this...	We're stuck with this fucking shit...
4 ...this shit...	It's too...
5 It is.	Eh?
6 It's too...	You get a bad month, all of a...
7 You're on this...	All of, they got you on this "board..."
8 I, I...I...	Some contest board...
9 I...	It's not right.

1 What could somebody get for them?	What could we get for them?  I don't know.  Buck a throw...buck-a- half a throw...I don't know...Hey, who knows what they're worth, what do they pay for them?  All told...must be, I'd... three bucks a throw...I don't know.

1 A job with Graff.	Is that what I said?
2 He'd give me a job.	He would take you on.  Yes.

1 Fine.	Uh-huh.
2 If anyone's going, I could use some coffee.

1 See...?  Were you the guy who broke in?	Was I?
2 Yes.	No.
3 Then don't sweat it, George, you know why?	No.
4 You have nothing to hide.	When I talk to the police, I get nervous.
5 Yeah.  You know who doesn't?	No, who?
6 Thieves.	Why?
7 They're inured to it.	You think so?
8 Yes.

1 I don't know, George, why?	'Cause, you know, 'cause they weren't, I know that Mitch and Murray uh...

1 And I don't want any fucking shit and I don't give a shit, Lingk puts me over the top, you filed it, that's fine, any other shit kicks out you go back.  You...you reclose it, 'cause I closed it and you...you owe me the car.	Would you excuse us, please.

1 John...John...John.  Okay.  John. John.  Look:  The Glengarry Highland's leads, you're sending Roma out.  Fine. He's a good man.  We know what he is.  He's fine.  All I'm saying, you look at the board, he's throwing...wait, wait, wait, he's throwing them away, he's throwing the leads away.  All that I'm saying, that you're wasting leads. I don't want to tell you your job. All that I'm saying, things get set, I know they do, you get a certain mindset... A guy gets a reputation.  We know how this...all I'm saying, put a closer on the job. There's more than one man for the... Put a...wait a second, put a proven man out...and you watch, now wait a second--and you watch your dollar volumes...You start closing them for fifty 'stead of twenty- five...you put a closer on the...	Shelly, you blew the last...
2 No.  John.  No.  Let's wait, let's back up here, I did...will you please?  Wait a second.  Please.  I didn't "blow" them.  No.  I didn't "blow" them.  No.  One kicked out, one I closed...	...you didn't close...
3 ...I, if you'd listen to me. Please.  I closed the cocksucker. His ex, John, his ex, I didn't know he was married...he, the judge invalidated the...

1 Alright.	And fifty bucks a lead.
2 John.  Listen.  I want to talk to you. Permit me to do this a second.  I'm older than you.  A man acquires a reputation.  On the street.  What he does when he's up, what he does otherwise...I said "ten," you said "no." You said "twenty." I said "fine," I'm not going to fuck with you, how can I beat that, you tell me?...Okay.  Okay.  We'll...Okay. Fine.  We'll...Alright, twenty percent, and fifty bucks a lead. That's fine.  For now.  That's fine. A month or two we'll talk.  A month from now.  Next month.  After the thirtieth.  We'll talk.

1 Ah, fuck.  Leads!  Leads! Williamson!  Send me out!  Send me out!	The leads are coming.
2 Get 'em to me!	I talked to Murray and Mitch an hour ago.  They're coming in, you understand they're a bit upset over this morning's...
3 Did you tell 'em my sale?

1 Okay: I...look: I'm going to make it worth your while.  I am.  I turned this thing around.  I closed the old stuff, I can do it again. I'm the one's going to close 'em. I am!  I am! 'Cause I turned this thing a...I can do that, I can do anyth...last night.  I'm going to tell you, I was ready to Do the Dutch.  Moss gets me, "Do this, we'll get well..." Why not.  Big fuckin' deal.  I'm halfway hoping to get caught.  To put me out of my...  But it taught me something.  What it taught me, that you've got to get out there.  Big deal.  So I wasn't cut out to be a thief.  I was cut out to be a salesman.  And now I'm back, and I got my balls back...and, you know, John, you have the advantage on me now: Whatever it takes to make it right, we'll make it right.  We're going to make it right.	I want to tell you something, Shelly.  You have a big mouth.

1 ...the fuck is that supposed to mean...?	Will you shut up, I'm telling you this...

1 Just now.	Guess who?

1 Mr. Morton's with American Express... he's...  I can tell Jim what you do...?	Sure.
2 Ray is director of all European sales and services for American Ex...  But I'm saying you haven't had a meal until you've tasted...I was at the Lingks' last...as a matter of fact, what was that service feature you were talking about...?	Which...
3 "Home Cooking"...what did you call it, you said it...it was a tag phrase that you had,,,	Uh...
4 Home...	Home cooking...
5 The monthly interview...?	Oh!  For the magazine...
6 Yes.  Is this something that I can talk ab...	Well, it isn't coming out until the February iss...sure.  Sure, go ahead, Ricky.

1 Money?  If that's what it signifies to you. Security?  Comfort?  All it is is THINGS THAT HAPPEN TO YOU.  That's all it is.  How are they different?  Some poor newly married guy gets run down by a cab.  Some busboy wins the lottery.  All it is, it's a carnival.  What's special...what draws us?  We're all different.  We're not the same.  We are not the same.  Hmmm.  It's been a long day.  What are you drinking?	Gimlet.
2 Well, let's have a couple more.  My name is Richard Roma, what's yours?	Lingk.  James Lingk.
3 James.  I'm glad to meet you.  I'm glad to meet you, James.  I want to show you something.  It might mean nothing to you...and it might not. 

1 Today.  Today.  Which, in any case, it was not, as there were a couple of points on the agreement I wanted to go over with you in any case.	The check wasn't cashed?
2 I just called downtown, and it's on their desk.

1 You cashed the check?	Not to my knowledge, no...

1 They didn't get your contract.  I filed it before I left.	They didn't get my contracts.
2 They--excuse me...

1 ...Mr. Williamson...	Your check as cashed yesterday afternoon.  And we're completely insured, as you know, in any case.

1 Who is the greatest man you can think of?	Go on, answer him when he talks to you.  Tell him: Columbus, Marconi... Garibaldi.

1 Honey!  Wait a minute; let's go for a drive.	I just had a drive; besides, I want to see my brother-in-law Michael.
2 Yeah, but I don't want him to see you.

1 I think there's only two hundred dollars under my hat.  I'm right.  Only two hundred dollars.	I'm a little short.  I've been out of work.  Let me owe you the money for a few weeks.
2 Ah, you're a sharp young fellow. How is it I've never noticed you before  You're too quiet for your own interest.  I could find some work for you to do that would be very profitable.  No hard feelings, eh?  If I can ever do you a service let me know. You've done a good job for yourself tonight.

1 Mike, I got something special up my sleeve for these boys.  You ever hear of &quot;Superman?&quot; And I don't mean the comic book.	No.
2 Wait'll you see!

1 What did I tell you.  The one who cut him was found in an alley.  And the family of the others paid Fanucci all their savings to make him forswear his vengeance.	 And he agreed?
2 He took the money.  Now he wants double from everybody in the neighborhood, including Papa.

1 You're going to talk to him now.	Yes.
2 Will you tell him?	I don't know.

1 Do you think they have somebody to back up Cicci?	No.  But if they do have somebody, you'll do three years for perjury if you give them so much as a wrong middle name.

1 It might show.	Mike wants it.

1 What the hell are you talking about?	We know you're a busy man, with plenty of enemies -- we saw the opportunity to do you a favor, and we did.  No strings.
2 No strings.	You know there's a Senate Investigating Committee recently set up; we thought it would be unfortunate if they were to trace anything though-provoking to your name.
3 No one can trace anything to me; I pride myself on that.	Do you gamble?
4 A little; what's so thought- provoking about that?	Do you owe markers?
5 Maybe two, three thousand dollars.

1 Leave her alone!  You're talking as though she has no right to be frightened when there are machine guns going off in her backyard.	Have Tom Hagen meet me in the Harbor House.

1 You have to be careful what you say in front of the others... they frighten easy.  It's always been that way, most men frighten easy.	We're making a big investment in Cuba.  That's my only concern.
2 My concern is that the three million never arrived at Batista's numbered account in Switzerland. He thinks it's because you have second thoughts about his ability to stop the rebels.	The money was sent.
3 Then you have to trace it.  Michael, people here look at me as a reliable man.  I can't afford not to be looked on as a reliable man.  But you know all that; there's nothing you can learn from me.  You shouldn't have to put up with a sick old man as a partner.	I wouldn't consider anyone else.
4 Except the President of the United States.

1 The hotel's registered owners are one Jacob Lawrence, and Sidney Barclay, both Beverly Hills attorneys.  In reality it's split between the Old Lakeville Road Group from Cleveland, and our friend in Miami.  He takes care of others outside the country, you know who I mean.  Meyer Klingman runs the store, and does all right, but I've been instructed to tell you, that if you move him out, our friend in Miami will go along with you.	He's very kind, tell him it's appreciated.  I'm sure it will be profitable all the way around.
2 He always makes money for his partners.  One by one, our old friends are gone.  Death, natural or not, prison, deported.  Our friend in Miami is the only one left, because he always made money for his partners.

1 The Corleone family controls two major hotels in Vegas; one in Reno. The licenses were grandfathered in, so you had no difficulties with the Gaming Commission.  But I have the idea from sources...  ...that you're planning to move in on the Tropicana.  In another week or so you'll move Klingman out, which leaves you with only one technicality.  The license, which is now in Klingman's name.	Turnbull is a good man.
2 Let's forget the bullshit, I don't want to stay here any longer than I have to.  You can have the license for two hundred and fifty thousand in cash, plus a monthly fee equal to five percent of the gross...

1 I have already rented the apartment to another family.	I told her I would speak to you, that you are a reasonable man who acted out of some misunderstanding. She has gotten rid of the animal that caused all the trouble, so why shouldn't she stay.  As one Italian to another, I ask you the favor.
2 I've already rented it; I cannot disappoint the new tenants.  They're paying a higher rent.	How much more a month?
3 Eh...  Five dollars more.

1 You know what?  I think you guys are all jealous.	What's to be jealous of?
2 I've gotten to know someone who's famous.	Not so famous any of us have ever heard of him.
3 If he were that famous, he probably wouldn't give me the time of day. This way, he's like <u>my</u> famous person.  Yeah, my own personal famous person.  Who treats me like I'm somebody worth talking to.

1 The Master is dressing.  I am to offer you a drink.  There is whiskey and there is iced tea.	Tea is fine.

1 You must leave.  You were not here this morning.	But I didn't do this!
2 The police will not know that. They will want to investigate.	We have his note.
3 Do you want to be questioned about you and Mr. Jimmy?  Please, Clayton.  It will be better if I find the body alone.	But how're you going to explain this?  How did you get him out of the pool?
4 You are right.  Yes.  We must put him back.

1 I apologize for going on like this. It's the Sunday painter in me.  Of course I can understand your refusal.  It's a great deal to ask of someone.	You mean -- you really want to draw me?
2 Indeed.  I'd pay for the privilege of drawing your head.	But why?
3 Even an amateur artist needs a subject to inspire him.	And it's just my head you want? Nothing else?
4 What are you suggesting?  You'll charge extra if I include a hand or a bit of shoulder.	You don't want to draw pictures of me in my birthday suit, right?
5 I have no interest in your body, Mr. Boone.  I can assure you of that.

1 You have to excuse me, Mr. Boone. Since my stroke, I am often overcome with nostalgia.	I don't mind.  I'm not crazy about my old man either.

1 Can I see what you did so far?	It will only make you self-conscious.  You'll have to remove your shirt.
2 Sorry.  Not today.	But we have to match the other sketch.
3 I just feel more comfortable keeping it on.  You just said you didn't want me self-conscious.

1 Isn't it enough you told me you're a fairy?  Do you have to rub my nose in it?	I assure you, Mr. Boone, I meant no --
2 From now on, Mr. Whale, I cut your grass and that's it.  Understand?

1 If you don't mind driving, I'd like to take you as my guest.  There should be lots of pretty starlets to keep you amused.	I'm game.  Sure.
2 Very good, Clayton.  May I call you Clayton?  Or do you prefer Boone?	Clayton is fine.

1 I better get you home before you catch your death from pneumonia.	Catch my death.

1 The morning after Pearl Harbor, he drove down to St. Louis to reenlist.  He was so damn excited. World War II was going to be his second chance.  They told him he was too old...fat ...nearsighted.  Said he'd be more use to his country if he stayed home and looked after his family.	Is that why you joined the Marines? For your father's sake?
2 I figured he'd think, you know -- it was the next best thing.  Hey, I loved it too.  A chance to be a part of something important. Something bigger than yourself.	What happened?
3 I didn't have the guts for it.

1 All right.  Let's take it off now.	What was that?
2 It's too tight.

1 I'm up.  Thanks.	Hasta la vista, Boone.  And give the jail bait a squeeze for me.

1 Where's Betty?	She took the night off.  Heavy date.  Some guy she's had her eye on for a while.

1 My God.  Is the audience to presume that Colin and I have done her hair?  I thought we were mad scientists, not hairdressers.	Only a mad scientist could do this to a woman.
2 Oh no, my dear.  You look absolutely amazing.  There's no way I can compete with you.  The scene is yours.	In the sequel, James, two lady scientists should make a monster. And our monster would be Gary Cooper.
3 I would've thought Mr. Leslie Howard would be more your line.	More your line.
4 My line nowadays runs to Rin Tin Tin.  Dogs are so much more dependable than men.

1 Mr. Kay, sir.	Yes?

1 Does the yardman come today?	Of course.  This afternoon.

1 So, Mr. Kay?  What do you want to know?	Everything.  Start at the beginning.
2 I was born outside London, the only son of a minister who was a master at Harrow.  Grandfather was a bishop.  Church of...Church of Eng...

1 Can that count as one question?	Of course.
2 I can't believe I'm doing this.

1 How's the leg?	Only hurts when I breathe. Lookit you. Where are Barney Fife and Aunt Bea hanging out? And Opie ... Where's Opie at?

1 Yeah -- ?	Yeah Tell him to lay off Kip and them Tell him it's on

1 Sound it out for me.	Your brother has four days. Fifty cars. Five-zero. For that he gets 200 large ...
2 And if he doesn't make it -- ?

1 Let's get out there. And have them run down every 167 Shelby Mustang in the area ... Find out where they're at.	What for?
2 You spend enough time down a man's throat, you get to know his tonsils. Do it ...

1 I know you.	You know my back.

1 I guess ...	You got a school teacher or Nancy from accounting, you don't put on Sly Stone or James Brown. You put on Ravel. Rachmaninoff. But if you got some wild one you just picked up at the track, you wouldn't put on Cat Stevens or James Taylor. You'd put on Prince. Or Isaac Hayes. Or, if you really wanted to get after it: Miles.
2 okay ...	It's the same way with cars. Different cars. Different tunes. You can't steal a Maserati listening to Sinatra. You gotta get urgent. You gotta get Sonny Rollins or Led Zeppelin IV, on that shit. But never, never-ever take no Allman Brothers into a Lincoln Town Car. Could lead to disaster. Got it... ?
3 Got it ...	Good.

1 For real. Okay. Gimme COLUMBO...	Peugot convertible ...
2 What color?	Gray.

1 We're on a truncated time-table. Take a day to shop it; a day to prep it ... And we're still going to need to expand the crew...	There's no one left ...
2 We've got several Italian cars on the list. Always tricky, always timeconsuming. So we're gonna need a specialist ...

1 You look good...	You, too, Ma...
2 What are you doing back?	How's Kip?

1 okay, sir. Let me just get the-order. Yes. We'll be doing some work out your way. We've got a power leak. And it's unsafe. We're moving residences to the... Marriott Long Beach ... Just for the night ...	Oh, for God's sake
2 I know, sir ...

1 Hey, Kip ...	Hello, Memphis --

1 So what are you gonna do?	About what?
2 "About what?"	About Calitri? No worries, man. I'll call him. He's a reasonable dude ...
3 I can see that -

1 You okay -- ?	I'm cool.

1 Where you off to -- ?	Thought I'd go for a ride -

1 Okay. We're all here. Today's Wednesday. D-Day is Friday night ... That gives us two days to prep ... We're going to find the ladies on our list, find out where they live, when they're home; that they're properly insured ... Let's get into the vans --	Where we going -- ?
2 We're going shopping -- !

1 What kind of trouble -- ?	Kip took a job. Fifty ladies in two weeks. Only the two weeks have turned into four days. And not a single lady has been snared.
2 And you got some Italians -- ?	Six or seven...
3 I'm not doing it anymore. Haven't for a while. I've carved out something for myself. It's pathetic, but it's mine ...	I understand -

1 Ready -- ?	Oh, yeah.

1 Donny got shot ... A jacker ...	How is he -- ?
2 They got him to the hospital. He's stable ...

1 You think it can be done?	Are you considering a comeback tour?
2 Tell me...	It can be done. Take two days to shop; one to prep. I'll offer up my bible for a small fee. You also have to hope Kip's jerk-circus didn't undo Castlebeck's linkage so much so that he's setting up surveillance teams on every city block. And then get yourself a crew...
3 The hard part ...	"A people is a detour of nature to get 6 or 7 great men - Yes, and then to get around them..." Nietzsche said that.
4 Is he still working here ?	The old crew. Go find them. I can't help you with that. Since I've cleaned up the act a bit, they no longer come around... A pity how legitimacy makes you unpopular -
5 I Just don't know how happy they'll be to see me

1 This Eleanor's been living at the International Towers for 3 years now.	Who's "Eleanor?"
2 The 167 Mustang Shelby Mustang GT-500.	Why do you call it "Eleanor?"
3 All the vehicles get code names. Female names. You say "Eleanor lives at such and such... " and no one listening on the waves is the wiser ...

1 Which way's out, man -- ?	Shit all looks the same here --

1 Paulie.  You're all I got.  I need help.	You treated me like shit.

1 I'm gonna need some money.	How much?

1 I had everybody working.  Even our old babysitter.	She's beautiful.  Look at her. Henry, look at her.
2 Hello!  Hello!  Have a good flight?

1 We got a problem, that thing we took care of upstate?	Paulie was just talking about him.
2 Well, we gotta dig him up again.	What?
3 The guy just sold the property. They're gonna build condominiums and I don't want anybody digging up the little bastard.	It's been six months.
4 It's still better than letting somebody find him.	If Paulie finds out, we got problems.
5 Fuck Paulie. If Batts' crew finds we whacked him, we got real problems.

1 I can't eat,  just get me some coffee.	He was jumpy. He hadn't touched a thing. In the old days, Jimmy would have ordered doubles and eaten it all.  On the surface, of course, everything was supposed to be fine. We were supposed to be discussing my case, just like we always would, but I had a feeling Jimmy was trying to sense whether I was going to rat him out to save my neck.
2 I think you got a good shot at beating the case.	How?
3 It's that rat bastard from Pittsburgh. He ratted you all out. He's been a rat since he got busted in Pittsburgh.	Yeah.
4 He's hiding, thE son of a bitch, in Florida.	Yeah.
5 I want you and Anthony to go down there and take care of that bastard. Without him, they've got no case.

1 I gotta go home.	What for? I got a pound of stuff in my jacket I've been carrying around all day. We gotta start taping it to your leg.
2 I gotta go home and get my hat.

1 The third store down.	Jimmy just stood there on the sidewalk. It felt funny. I started walking down the block, but I noticed the stores were empty.

1 Who's she talking to?	That fuckin' guinea, Will knows him.

1 She didn't do it again did she?	Jesus Christ. Not even close.

1 How's the woman?	Gone.
2 What?	She went to Medical school in California.
3 Sorry, brother.  I don't know what to tell ya. You know all the girls I been with. You been with 'em too, except for Cheryl McGovern which was a big mistake on your part brother...	Oh I'm sure, that's why only one of us has herpes.
4 Some shows are worth the price of admission, partner.

1 Oh, right.	This is your house, right?

1 Morgan, I'm not goin' to "Kelly's Roast Beef" just cause you like the take-out girl. It's fifteen minutes out of our way. MORGAN What else we gonna do we can't spare fifteen minutes?	All right Morgan, fine. I'll tell you why we're not going to "Kelly's." It's because the take-out bitch is a fuckin' idiot. I'm sorry you like her but she's dumb as a post and she has never got our order right, never once.
2 She's not stupid.

1 Chuck, let's go.	You're walkin' bitch, Will's takin' the car.

1 Hey, come on pal we're in classes all day. That's one thing about Harvard never seizes to amaze me, everybody's talkin' about school all the time.	Hey, I'm the last guy to want to talk about school at the bar. But as long as you're here I want to "seize" the opportunity to ask you a question.

1 Excuse me. Is this the buildings and grounds office?	Yeah, can I help you?
2 I'm trying to find the name of a student who works here.	No students work for me.
3 Could you just check, because the young man who works in my building--	Which one's your building?
4 Building two.

1 Oh, for God's sake, Will.	Oh, come on! You're not pinnin' this one on me. He left, I wanted to talk to him for another twenty minutes. I was havin' fun.
2 I told you to cooperate with these people.	C'mon, that guy was a fuckin' piece of work.

1 This job... Do it if it's what you really want.	I appreciate that.

1 I've been busy, Gerry. I got a full schedule.	This kid's special, Sean. I've never seen anything like him.
2 Not much free time, Gerry. LAMBEAU Have you ever heard of a man named Ramanujan?

1 Seems like it's going well.	I think so.
2 Well, have you talked to him at all about his future?	We haven't really gotten into it. LAMBEAU Maybe you should. My phone's been ringing off the hook with job offers.
3 Jobs doing what?	Cutting edge mathematics. Think tanks. The kind of place where a mind like Will's is given free reign.
4 That's great, Gerry, that there's interest-- But I'm not sure he's ready for that.	Sean, I really don't think you understand--
5 What don't I understand?

1 Sean, do you have any idea what the odds are against winning the lottery?	I don't know... Gotta be at least four to one.
2 About thirty million to one.	You're pretty quick with those numbers. How about the odds of me buying the first round?
3 About thirty million to one.

1 That's why I love stock-car racin'. That Dale Ernhart's real good.	Now you know Will, and I know, what you need to be doing. You have a gift.
2 I could work the pit maybe, but I could never drive like Dale Ernhart--	--you have a quality-- something you were born with, that you have no control over- and you are, in a sense, hiding that by becoming a janitor. And I'm not saying that's wrong. I'm friends with the janitor that works in my building. He's been to my house for dinner. As a matter of fact I did some free consultation for "Mike" -- that's not his real name. That's in my book.
3 Yeah, I read your book. "Mike" had the same problems as "Chad" the stockbroker.	Yes. The pressures you feel, and again, I am neither labeling nor judging them, are keeping you from fulfilling your potential -- you're in a rut. So stop the Tom Foolery -- the Shenanigan's, Will.
4 You're right. I know.	Will, your not getting off that easy.
5 No, but, I mean you know...I do other things. That no one knows about.	Like what, Will?
6 I go places, I interact.	What places?
7 Certain, clubs.  Like, Paradise. It's not bad.

1 If you ever disrespect my wife again...I will end you.	Time's up.

1 Do you think you're alone?	What?
2 Do you have a soul-mate?	Define that.
3 Someone who challenges you in every way. Who takes you places, opens things up for you. A soul-mate.	Yeah.

1 I just want you to know, Sean...	You're Welcome, Will.
2 I'll keep in touch.	I'm gonna travel a little bit, so I don't know where I'll be.

1 I really don't 'date' that much.	You know what I mean. I know you've at least thought about it.
2 No I haven't...	Yes you have. You were thinking you were gonna get a good night kiss.
3 No I wasn't...	Yes you were.
4 I was kinda' hopin' to get a "good night laid" but...I'll take a kiss.

1 Why do we always stay here?	'Cause it's nicer than my place.
2 I've never seen your place.	Exactly.
3 What about your friends? Or your brothers? When do I get to meet them?	They don't come over here that much.
4 I think I can make it to South Boston.	Aah, it's kind of a hike.
5 Is it me you're hiding from them or the other way around?	All right, all right. We'll go.
6 When?	Sometime. I don't know. Next week.
7 What if I said I wouldn't sleep with you again until you let me meet your friends?	I'd say...  It's only four in the mornin', they're prob'ly up.

1 Yeah.	I love you, Will.  No take-backs.

1 Go on. Get in your tent. You don't know nothin'.	How 'bout you?
2 *Some*body got to take the blame. They just *got* to hang it on somebody, you know.  An' I ain't doin' nothin' but set around.	But ain't no reason--
3 Lissen. I don't care nothin' about you, but if you mess in this, your whole fambly li'ble to get in trouble, an' Tom get sent back to the penitentiary.	Okay. I think you're a darn fool, though.
4 Sure. Why not?

1 Tom? You can come on. They gone.	We got to get outa here right away. Ever'body here? Where's Uncle John?

1 Want to work?	Sure, but what is this?
2 That's not your affair. Name.	Joad.
3 How many men?	Four.
4 Women?	Two.
5 Kids?	Two.
6 Can all of you work?	Why, I guess so.
7 Okay. House 63. Wages 5 cents a box. No bruised fruit. Move along and go to work right away.

1 This used to be mine. I give it to Grampa when I went away.  You reckon they could be dead?	I never heard nothin' about it.

1 I guess that's right. Have to take a beatin' before he'll know.	We was outa food. Tonight we had meat. Not much, but we had it. Think Pa's gonna give up his meat on account a other fellas? An' Rosasharn needs milk. Think Ma's gonna starve that baby jus' cause a bunch a fellas is yellin' outside a gate?
2 Got to learn, like I'm a-learnin'. Don't know it right yet myself, but I'm tryin' to fin' out. That's why I can't ever be a preacher again. Preacher got to *know*.  I don't. I got to *ask*.

1 I never asked you!	Sure, but you'd a throwed a fit if I hadn't tol' you.

1 What's the matter, Grampa?	Ain't nothin' the matter. I just ain't a-goin', that's all.

1 We gonna live here?	Why, sure. It won't be so bad once we get her washed out.
2 I like the tent better.	This got a floor. Wouldn't leak when it rains.

1 That!	They charge extry at the comp'ny store but they ain't no other place.

1 Ma, you sick?	Ya say we're acrost?
2 Look, Ma!	Thank God!  An' we're still together-- most of us. 
3 Didn' you get no sleep?	No.
4 Was Granma bad?	Granma's dead.
5 When?	Since before they stopped us las' night.
6 An' that's why you didn't want 'em to look?	I was afraid they'd stop us an' wouldn't let us cross. But I tol' Granma. I tol' her when she was dyin'. I tol' her the fambly had ta get acrost. I tol' her we couldn't take no chances on bein' stopped.

1 What is it?	Don't know--but it's better'n this.

1 Well?	They come. They come and pushed me off.

1 Either we got to tie him up and *throw* him on the truck, or somepin. He can't stay here.	Can't tie him. Either we'll hurt him or he'll git so mad he'll hurt his self.  Reckon we could git him *drunk*?
2 Ain't no whisky, is they?

1 Whatta you think you're talkin' about? I got a han'bill here says good wages, an' I seen it in the papers they need pickers!	Awright, go on! Ain't nobody stoppin' ya!
2 But what about this?	I ain't gonna fret you. Go on!

1 Jes' like in the catalogues, ain't they!	I seen 'em b'fore you did.
2 What's this?	Now don't you go monk'ing--

1 We had pictures put on, that way everybody knows who everybody was!	Wonderful.
2 So, what are you doing now?	Whatever I can get away with.

1 Oh I see. You got your individual slices of hope, dignity, confidence, self-love, justice, and harmony.	You open 'em up and there's the sayings, stories, little bites of insight. It's the P.P.P. Six Day Week.
2 So you eat-- read it everyday?	Yes.
3 And these pan pizzas have opened up the doors to heaven?	Correct.  That's for you. Keep it.

1 Are you there?	Yes.
2 Pick me up at my father's house at around seven. And don't be late this time.

1 He was trying to kill you, right!	Yes.
2 Not the other way around...?	No.
3 Is it something you've done?	It's something I do...

1 Anyway, that never use to happen. I was always the prodigy. Now I'm just one of the guys.	Maybe some of the discomfort you're feeling is... guilt. Remorse. Over the innocent people you've killed.
2 If I show up at your door, chances are you did something to bring me there. I don't care about that stuff, anyway.	What stuff?
3 Morality.

1 It's a free-market evolution. You'll wake up to it... c'mon Kid. We used to run together when you were a rookie. I don't want to run against you. This thing's real. Everybody's in.	Not me. So don't paw at me with your dirty little guild.
2 I'm gonna get you, kid.

1 I'm an attorney. I'm with Moss, Brice & Fromeyer.	That sounds pretty interesting...

1 He's falling for her. Look at him.	He using her.
2 You're wrong. Look at his face.	One cannot love and kill.
3 I love. I kill.

1 This is not good.	I'll do it tomorrow.

1 So what happened to you?	Same thing that happened to you-- I stopped poutin' there on the sidelines. Got in. Got on the team. I joined the working week, you slick fucking asshole, so why don't you valet park your high horse and take it easy on your old buddy, Paul.
2 Fair enough.

1 Good evening, Mr. Newberry.	Good evening, Mr. Blank.
2 How are you? How's business?	Martin, I don't know where you've been since you abandoned my daughter ten years ago, and I don't care. It was good that you left, and I'm glad you did. So what do you want to talk about? You've grown up a bit. Maybe I had you figured wrong.
3 How's that?	I visualized you, in a haze, as one of the slackster, flannel-wearing, coffeehouse-misanthropes I've been seeing in Newsweek.
4 I took the other road. I'm more of a self-reflective young lion who does business with lead-pipe cruelty and goes home to drink light beer in milky-eyes isolation. I love sports and sex and have no real relationships with anyone. And you?	Oh, you know me, Martin. I'm the same old sell-out baby-boomer, exploiting the oppressed I got shot for at Kent State. But why don't we have a drink and forget the whole thing?

1 I don't have a problem with that. It's up to Annie.	Well, it's worth it, really? I mean, how much longer do you think you need to work with Pilgrim?
2 That's up to Pilgrim.

1 He's beautiful.	Why don't you ride anymore? Grace told me you used to ride when she was younger.
2 She did?

1 I hear that! See, I knew she was never going to be a ranchest, but I wanted to try -- I thought maybe she'd give music lessons to the kids in town or at the school, maybe even recitals. My son would grow up here. Maybe have one or two more. I'd teach 'em what I could. They'd play with my brother's kids. All grow up together. And even if they all decided to go out into the world, they'd always know where home was -- cause we'd keep it for 'em...	That's very important to you, isn't it? Home.
2 Yeah, I think it is. And I don't mean everybody's got to be married, have kids -- It's more like, knowing where you're from, where you belong, what feeds you, where you can go no matter what happens... Knowing what you're supposed to be doing while you're here.	How did you find out all that?

1 I don't know any other way, Annie.	Why?

1 IT'S ALMOST LUNCHTIME. ARE YOU HUNGRY!?	Whatever you want.
2 Fine!	Fine.

1 We'll have more room because we're moving onto the ranch. They have this empty house near this creek. It's actually pretty... OK... I love you.  Dad wants to talk to you.	Hi.

1 I don't deserve that. I have never looked at you as a disappointment. If I'm on your back to do better, if I push you to try harder it's because I want you to be the best you can be.	FOR YOU! Because I'm your daughter which means you're the best mother! Isn't that what you're always talking about in interviews -- having it all, the great career, the great family... Proving everybody wrong. Wanting everybody to think you're this perfect woman!

1 Smokey told me he left last night to look at some horses in Sheriden. He won't be back for three days. I can't believe he didn't want to say goodbye.	Well... honey... you know... that's just not his way. Maybe you can write him a letter or something. Say thank you... Don't think about it... You take care and I'll see you home.

1 I'm sorry about last night. I shouldn't have brought it up over the phone.	That's okay. We have to talk about it and we're not always in the same place ... so... I just have to get used to it.  What do you want to do about dinner?
2 I don't know. We'll figure it out.

1 "... FRESH, WIND IN HER HAIR... LIFE WITHOUT CARE... SHE'S BROKE... BUT IT'S 'OK'...	Sing it to me, Frankie!
2 How's my pregnant chick!

1 Yeah. She seems to be getting more comfortable on the ranch, which is why I said yes to this move. But, whenever it's just the two of us, I don't know... Anyway... what's happening with the Delco lawsuit?	Taking forever. I just got an additional list of sixty-two employees to interview before Monday. I don't know how I'm going to do it.
2 Well, it's good that you're there.

1 Was the trip okay?	Mmm. I made good time.  Pilgrim's in the back. I found a new stable, but they can't take him until tomorrow.

1 How's Peterson's holding up for you?	It's fine. Comfortable. I still can't get used to how dark it gets around here, though. When we leave the ranch, I always hold my breath until I can see the motel.

1 What?	Annie, I'm not good at this kind of talk -- goes round and round a thing but never comes to it -- so let's just say what it is. When you first came here, I didn't like you and I was worried. Tom means a lot to me and this family. Don't go looking here for whatever you looking for. Don't make that man go through something it took him a long time to see his way clear out of the first time.
2 I don't think anybody can make Tom do anything he didn't want.	He's a good man, Tom is. He's got a gift, come from heaven above, I swear. But he's still a man. And a woman can lead a man into the middle of a mountain lake -- and still make him think he's on dry land.

1 ... well, I just think she's got a lot of nerve showing up here. Draggin' that child and that poor animal all the way...  You eat with those fingers again and you know what'll happen!  Frank, don't you think she's got a nerve?	Oh hell, I don't know... According to Tom, she's a pretty determined woman. Must've thought it was worth it.
2 I guess they'll want feeding and all, out here all day long.

1 He says if you do it soon as they're born, it makes them real easy to handle later on.	That's what some folks say.
2 There was this thing on the TV about a guy who does it with geese. He has this airplane and these baby geese all grow up thinking it's their mom, and he flies it and they just follow.  You hear 'bout that, Uncle T?

1 We thought we lost him in the snow storm... Told the kids. Had a funeral for the damn thing. Finally, snow stops. Staring to warm up. I go out and start cleaning the truck... Goddamn if that dog doesn't jump out from the back seat covered in snow... I nearly stained myself.	He thought it was a ghost.

1 I can't...	I don't have all day.

1 It's warmer than I thought.	You want to go to a movie tonight?
2 I thought your mom's coming up?	So?

1 You want to watch some television?	Maybe... look -- just...

1 Is the poverty worse, now, you think?	I haven't been back in over twenty years, but I wouldn't be surprised. The population's larger.

1 Welcome to our show!	Hack the Planet!

1 Shit!	Shh!
2 Was that her top?

1 Ta-da!	Yo, brain dead, the manual!

1 One-handed!	Difficulty rating?

1 Due to Mr. Gill's untimely demise and everything, I guess you two will have to improvise the next round.	Right. If I win, you wear a dress on our date.

1 Lauren Murphy is now a wanted felon in the state of Washington. Forgery, Embezzlement, two drug convictions, plus she jumped parole. When she's arrested, she will not have a trial, she will not pass go, she will go directly to jail. Then I change this file back to the original, and your mom disappears.	That's bullshit.
2 What can I tell you. Computers never lie, kid. Your mom will be arrested at work, she'll be handcuffed, and later, strip searched.	You lay a finger on her and I'll kill you.
3 Kid, don't threaten me. There are worse things than death and, uh, I can do all of them!

1 Two days.	And judging by this segment alone, it's already eaten about...

1 Burn. You're Acid Burn. You booted me out of OTV!	What?
2 I'm Crash Override.	You're the moron that's been invading my turf?

1 Why did he come to you?	I got a record. I was Zero Cool.

1 Oh, wow, she's great.	Yeah.

1 Hello?	We caught 'em.
2 Good.	Red handed! You won't be having any more trouble from them.

1 I need a handle, man. I don't have an identity until I have a handle.	You know, you're right about that.  Check it, Friday.

1 A hacker planted the virus.	Virus?
2 Yesterday, the ballast program for a supertanker training model mistakenly thought the vessel was empty, and flooded its tanks.	Excuse me?
3 The little boat flipped over. A virus planted in the Gibson computer system claimed responsibility.	What, it left a note?

1 Purpose of visit?	A patient pickup and transfer to Smith's Grove.
2 You're late.	Yeah.  Should be on the road.
3 Yeah, ha, hell of a night huh?	Real charmer.
4 I'll take you down there.	All right.

1 You think she stands a chance?	She's not dead!

1 Mom, please	You'll have to watch Jamie tonight.
2 Not tonight. I've got that date with Brady. You know how important that is.	Well tonight is very important for your father and me.
3 Can't you find somebody else?	Its too late.
4 What am I supposed to tell Brady? Sorry, but I've got to baby-sit my foster sister, go and have fun by yourself.	Its not exactly the end of the world, for goodness sake

1 Yes.	I'm Dr. Hoffman, Medical Administrator.
2 Has he been prepped?	Ready to go.  Who signs for him?
3 I do.	Outside.
4 Check him out.

1 Kido. It's four in the morning.	I can't sleep.
2 What is this? Four nights in a row?  You going for a record here?  The seven year olds insomniacs hall of fame?	Do you love me Rachel?
3 Oh, serious questions tonight.  Of course I love you.	Like a sister?
4 Jamie, sometimes it's...	Like a real sister?
5 We're not real sisters Jamie, but that doesn't mean I love you any less.

1 Come on Rachel!	Coming.
2 I thought you said you were ready.	I'm ready. I'm ready. Okay, let's go.

1 You don't believe that do you?	No.

1 Logan, I want you to stay here in case the family gets back.	Right here, Ben.
2 You look sharp. You understand?	No problem, Sheriff.

1 Something?	He's been here.
2 How do you know?

1 How's it powered?	Batteries. I planned the generator for the house next week. I wished I hadn't waited.  This is squawk 79er zero of Haddonfield broadcasting on the state police emergency frequency. Can anyone hear me?

1 Hi, Annie, Laurie...	Hi, Dad. What happened?
2 What?	What happened?
3 Someone broke into the hardware store. Probably kids.	You blame everything on kids.
4 The only things missing were some Halloween masks, rope, a set of knives. What does that sound like to you?

1 Look.	Look where?
2 Behind that bush there.

1 Fancy.	This has not been my night. My clothes are in the wash, I spilled butter down the front of me, I got stuck in a window...
2 I'm glad you're here because I have something I want you to do. I want you to call up Ben Tramer and tell him you were just fooling around.	I can't.
3 Yes, you can.	He went out drinking beer with Mike Godfrey and he won't be back until late. YOU'LL have to call him tomorrow. Besides, I'm on my way to pick up Paul.

1 I wonder where they went.	Annie probably took Lindsey out or something. Let's look for a note.

1 Anybody live here?	Not since 1963, since it happened. Every kid in Haddonfield thinks this place is haunted.
2 They may be right.

1 Annie, some day you're going to get us all in deep trouble.	Totally.

1 Laurie...	I'm so embarrassed. I couldn't face him...

1 I'm scared!	There's nothing to be scared of now. Get changed.

1 What did he say?	He asked me if I could help him find his purple lawnmower.
2 I don't think this is any time to be funny...	He said something else. "It's all right now. He's gone. The evil's gone."

1 What are your favorite buildings, David?	You want to see some?
2 Oh, yeah.	Well, let's do it.
3 Great.

1 Oh!	Oh, is that what it is?
2 Uh-- APRIL  I-i-it has an o-organic quality, you know.	Right.
3 It's almost...almost, uhhh, entirely wholly interdependent, if you know what I mean.  I-I... I can't put it into words.  The important thing is-is-is it-it breathes.

1 Mm-hm.	Yeah, it was funny, it was very funny.  But the show was about the two Frenchmen, now that was funny and it was warm.

1 The design's deliberately noncontextural.  But I wanted to... keep the atmosphere of the street, you know, and the proportions.	Uh-huh.
2 And in the material. That's...that's unpolished red granite. 

1 Now I ca-can't remember.	Let's take a look.

1 Hi, Dusty.	Hi.

1 Yeah.	...ex-husband on the street the other day.

1 Fine.  Oh, we went to the Caravaggio exhibition at the Met.  It's such a treat to go through a museum with Frederick.  I mean...you learn so much.  Do you like Caravaggio?	Oh, yes.  Who doesn't?  Look!

1 Uh...did you ever get around to e.e. cummings?	Yes, he's just adorable.

1 O-o-o-okay, Lee.  Okay, okay.  You, you, y-you've said enough.  It's my responsibility now.  I will work things out.	Look, don't do anything on my behalf.  I live with Frederick, and Hannah and I are close.
2 Yes, but you, you do care about me.	Oh, Elliot, please!  I can't be a party to this!  I'm suddenly wracked with guilt just standing her talking to you on the street!

1 But it hasn't been forever. 	It's been nearly a year since our first time and you're still married to my sister, which...I now realize is fine because you're probably much more in love with her than you know.
2 Yeah, but we-we made so many plans.	Yeah.  Uh, well, sure we did.  An- an-and in a way you led me on, because I truly believed you were unhappy with Hannah.  Otherwise, I would never have let myself be drawn in.  I was very weak.  So were you.  Now I've met someone else.

1 Yes.  I know.  The last few weeks, you haven't been yourself.  And tonight at, tonight at dinner, you, you were kind of curt with me.	Was I?
2 Yes, you were.  A-and when I, when I brought up the idea of having a baby, you just, you jumped down my throat.	Well, I-I don't think it's a very good idea.
3 Why not?	Because it's the last thing in the world we need right now.
4 Why do you say that?  Is there something wrong?	I don't know.
5 Well, tell me.  Should I be worried?	But, you got four children!
6 I want one with you.	Well...I-I think we should wait till things settle.
7 But what do, what do you--  what's that mean?  W-w-we've been, we've been married for four years. How settled can things get?	You know, y-you have some very set plans on how your life should be structured.  A-a house, uh, kids, certain schools, a h--, a home in Connecticut.  I-it's all very...preconceived.
8 Yeah, but I...uh--I thought you needed that.  When-when-when we met, you said your life was chaos.	I-I-I know, but there's got to be some give and take.

1 ...this is a toast!  This is a toast.	Get his wine away.
2 This is a toast.  You know this beautiful Thanksgiving dinner was all...

1 Why should I be afraid?	Oh! 'Cause you won't exist!
2 So?	That thought doesn't terrify you?

1 Elliot lusts after you.	Based on what?  You never even see him.

1 Oh, God, that's too much responsibility for me.  It's not fair!  I want a less complicated life, Frederick.  I want a husband, maybe even a child before it's too late.	Jesus...Jesus!
2 Oh, God, I don't even know what I want.	Oh...
3 Tch, oh, what do you get out of me, anyway?  I mean...  it's not sexual anymore.  It's certainly not intellectual.  I mean, you're so superior to me in every way that--

1 Do you realize what a thread we're all hanging by?	Mickey, you're off the hook.  You should be celebrating.
2 Can you understand how meaningless everything is?  Everything!  I'm talking about nnnn--our lives, the show...the whole world, it's meaningless.	Yeah...but you're not dying!
3 No, I'm not dying now, but, but  you know, when I ran out of the hospital, I, I was so thrilled because they told me I was going to be all right.  And I'm running down the street, and suddenly I stop, 'cause it hit me, all right, so, you know, I'm not going to go today. I'm okay.  I'm not going to go tomorrow.  But eventually, I'm going to be in that position.

1 I hope you tell her it was your idea...	Why?
2 ...'cause every time I try to be helpful, you know, sh-she gets so defensive.	Oh, Hannah, she's-she's just embarrassed in front of you, that's all.

1 Yeah, aren't you like, you know...	Huh?
2 ...a little, uh, hey!  A little hug! What is this?  Now how 'bout a little action from the kids?

1 Yeah, they have these banks, you know, where they keep them frozen.	Fro--?  You want a-a defrosted kid? Is that your idea?
2 I want to experience childbirth.	With a, with a stranger?  With a--
3 Just think about it.  That's all I ask.

1 Hannah, I have to borrow some more money.  Don't get upset.	Mmm, I never get upset over that. Mmm?
2 This is the last time, I promise. And I'm keeping strict accounts.

1 Oh, Hannah!	It's, uh, you never know--
2 He's such a loser!	He's not a loser at all!
3 Oh, he's such a loser!	He's the headmaster of Daisy's school.
4 Oh, perfect!  He reminds me of Ichabod Crane.  His Adam's apple keeps jumping up and down whenever he gets excited. HANNAH  Listen.  He's a lot better than your ex-husband.  He's got a good job.  Would you light those, please? He's-he's-he's not a dope addict or anything.

1 Uh, you know, I think I can fake my way through a song.	Uh-huh.
2 Easily.

1 Well, that...th-that's fine.	But what I decided to do is some writing.  Yeah, I think I've had it with acting.  You know, these meaningless auditions at cattle calls.  And I can't handle another rejection.  Now let's face it here.  I gotta, you know, latch on to something in my life.  You know--something with a future.  I'm not sixteen anymore.  It's just...crazy!  I've got...an idea for a story. More than one.  And I just need a few months, you know, or, uh, a year even.

1 Wow, I guess I hit a nerve.	You make it sound like, you know, I have no needs or something.  You think I'm too self-sufficient?
2 Now, Hannah, that's not what I meant, you know.  Uh, yeah, everybody relies on you for so much. "You're so giving. It's not a criticism.  We love you. We're grateful."	You're grateful, but you resent me.
3 Oh, wow!  I don't want to have this conversation.  I didn't do anything wrong.

1 Mmm, I don't know if you remember me, but we had the worst night of my life together.	I remember you.
2 Yes, you do recall, right?	I recall you.
3 I was walking past and I saw you in here...	Yeah.
4 ...and I thought I'd come in and...and we could replay, uh, the whole, uh...	We didn't hit it off.
5 Oh, that's putting it mildly.  We did everything but exchange gunshots.	How are you?
6 Good.  How are you?	I'm fine.
7 You look wonderful.	Oh, no.
8 Yeah, really.  You do.  You do.	Yeah?
9 It was a terrible evening.	Yeah, it was.
10 Remember slamming the cab door in my face and..  you know, it came very dangerously close to emasculating my nose in a... 

1 No, you can tell me straight.  It's okay.  Just, you know, tell me what you think.	It's great.  I swea-- I'm-- I'm, tch, I'm speechless.  I was...I was not in the mood to listen to this thing now.  I don't know what to say.  I'm moved and I laughed and I-- Uh, I, you know, I was on the edge of my seat.  I just think it's wonderful! I'm, I'm totally...stunned.  This is not an insult.  I'm amazed that you can...  It was-- I just thought it was great.
2 Really?	Yes!  I was abso-- And...w- what...made you think of that climax scene where the, where the... architect is walking home with his actress girlfriend and-and the ex- wife who's schizophrenic jumps out of the bushes and stabs him to death?
3 Oh, it just came to me one day.	Well, it was just fabulous!  I'm, I, you know...
4 Oh, gosh, you really think I can write?	I thought it was wonder-- There's maybe one or two things in there that I would do differently myself, but...
5 Right.	...but who cares?  It was just--  It was fabulous.
6 Oh!	Fabulous, I mean it!  I'm so impressed.

1 Yeah, she knows it, too, 'cause she's flirting with all the men here.	God.

1 Aren't you glad to see me?	Tell me about your trip... what did you <u>bring</u> me...?

1 You want to get married...?	You tol me you wuunt ask me again til I'm ready....
2 You're ready now.	I'm not.
3 That's what <u>you</u> think...

1 Hold up a minute...	You spend the afternoon in Bed?
2 First things first.	You take this much time over everything?
3 That's why my wife adores me.

1 ..It won't be long now, sir...	OHFORGODSAKE, get ON with it.

1 Yes sir, I saw it. 	We have a memo here, from your friend Mr. Krendler at the Justice Department.
2 I am all attention.	He requests your presence, once again, as part of...

1 I said how's your baby...?	You want to <u>hold</u> him...?
2 Waal...	'bout time you <u>learned</u>...

1 And?  Then?	I wonder no longer.  You were out of the country.
2 How could you know?	I <u>sense</u>...  The faintest <u>whiff</u> of a perfume, whose <u>base</u>, whose <u>base</u>, whose <u>base</u> is "Hamamelis" ... it is <u>witch-hazel</u>--such a clean scent.  No, not a European scent. I would say it is a scent of the New World.  I would say, you have been in America.  Have I struck home?
3 You know America?	...you have <u>brought</u> this perfume... brought this perfume.  Back.  <u>Back</u> from America.  To your New Wife...  You have given it to her, and some of...  Some of 'her perfume' has found its way back onto you.  Lucky man.  Lucky man, indeed.

1 Make them eat the figurine.	They <u>will</u>, sir.  We <u>train</u> them, to the figurine, <u>eventually</u>, they consume a man, say, 80 kilos, say, in...
2 ...tell them...

1 ...I'm sorry....?	...we were speaking of my <u>father</u>...
2 Indeed we were.	...and my need for The Institution...
3 Freud, do you know...?  Freud psychoanalyzed patients in One Afternoon.	And how did he do that?
4 He saw the truth, and <u>spoke</u> it...	I'm afraid, this wine is making me woozy...
5 ...you have to <u>eat</u>...

1 Yeah, well, it's a raw wound, innit, you're gonna bump it, every time you turn around... but you know what the <u>trick</u> is...?	...not to turn around.

1 Ask me when we get home.	Oh, my <u>program</u>...

1 She must be something special After Dark.	I can't remember.  I've got to make some money.
2 Thirty thousand dollars reward.  In the whereabouts of Il Dottore Fanelli, or the apprehension of his...	...yes, yes, yes....

1 ...sir...?	Isn't it funny?  You can look on my face  which you would grant me, is the most hideous sight you will see in what I hope is a long life. You can look at me.  Which shows  a Strength which <u>must</u> come from strong  strong convictions.   But you <u>shy</u> when I say the name of God.

1 Now what? What did I do this time?	I just wanted to know if you've seen this.

1 Man, she's losing it...	It's about time. Isn't Fun great?

1 You're a little harsh on Todd. You're a little harsh on everybody.

1 I'm sorry. It just...It seems silly. Like kissing a girl.	Clever observation. Go back to Wichita.  Oh that's right, you can't.

1 Isn't this the time where one of us says something deeply offensive to the other one...We're just so different.	So what?                                                    ]

1 Betty, your daydreams are a lot better than my realities, believe me. I'm afraid though it's time to get your butt kicked.	Ronnie!

1 Take a break Veronica, sit down.	All right.

1 Hey, this question wouldn't be that bizarro thing you were babbling about over the phone last......	Shut up, it is. I told Dennis if he gave me another topic that was political, I'd spew burrito chunks.

1 You stupid cunt!	You goddamn bitch!

1 I think you can. In Catcher in the Rye Holden says his ideal job'd be making sure some kids don't fall off a cliff. He doesn't realize if you pay too much attention to the kids, you'll back off the cliff yourself.	Very very. The photographs?
2 Don't worry. I'll ask you to do me a favor. You'll get the negatives and everything back then.

1 Veronica! Color me stoked, girl. I've gotten <u>everyone</u> to sign this petition even the one who think BigFun are tuneless Eurofags. People love me!  My God, you haven't signed!	People love you but I know you. Jennifer Forbes told me the petition she signed was to put a jacuzzi in the cafeteria. And Doug Hylton...
2 So some people need different kinds of "convincing" than others....  Hey, just sign the petition!	Don't talk to me like that.
3 It was J.D.'s idea! He made out the signature sheet and everything. Now will you sign it?	No.
4 Jealous much?

1 Veronica. What are you doing tonight?	Mourning. Maybe watch some T.V. Why?
2 Ram asked me out, but he wants to double with Kurt and Kurt doesn't have a date.	Hea<u>ther</u>, I've got something going with J.D.
3 Please Veronica. Put Billy the Kid on hold tonight, I'll never forget it.

1 Dreadful etiquette. I apologize.	S'okay....
2 I saw the croquet set-up in the back. Up for a match?

1 Something tells me you picked up the wrong cup.	No shit, sherlock. I can't believe it. I just killed my best friend.
2 And your worst enemy.	Same difference. Oh jesus, I'm gonna...

1 Do you take German?	French.

1 You believed it because you wanted to believe it. Your true feelings were too gross and icky for you to face.	I did not want them <u>dead</u>.
2 Did to.	Did not.
3 Did to.	Did not.

1 Catch a movie? Miniature Golf?	I was thinking more along the lines of slitting Heather Duke's wrists open and making it look like a suicide.
2 I could be up for that. I've already started underlining <u>meaningful</u> passages in Heather's copy of Catcher in the Rye, if you know what I mean. So are we on?

1 How do you turn the fucker off?	You're not listening. People are going to look at the ashes of Westerburg and say there's a school that self-destructed not because society didn't care, but because that school <u>was</u> society. Is that deep or what? I'll let you put it in your diary, babe. Free of charge.
2 The bomb, asshole!	Just push the red button twice. That's what stops it. If that's what you want, babe?
3 You know what I want, babe?	What?

1 Terrible thing. So will we get to meet this dark horse prom contender?	May<u>be</u>.

1 I'm so sorry. I was led to believe there were going to be different kinds of social and psychological types at this gathering.	Oh, I was scared of the same thing, Heather. The minute you try to deal with the actual teenagers who have contemplated suicide you're stepping into quicksand. Quicksand filled with bad complexions, bad grades, bad parents, bad drugs, and all sorts of doody nobody wants to hear let alone bend down to clean up.

1 No arguments there, Dr. Hulme! All that time inside working on those novels of theirs. They don't get fresh air or exercise!	frowns at Henry.

1 I had a nasty foreboding feeling at first, but now I realise my crime was too frightful for an ordinary lecture.	From now on, you're sleeping in the house, where we can keep an eye on you.

1 And so, in a blazing fury, Charles runs Lancelot Trelawney through with his sword . . . leaving Deborah free to accept Charles's proposal of marriage!	and HERBERT exchange a glance. HONORA smiles at Juliet.
2 I've heard your mother on 3YA. The Woman's Session has lots of lively debate.	Well, actually, Mummy's left that programme now . . she's far too busy with The Marriage Guidance Council.

1 0h, God . . . I'm so sorry!	It doesn't matter.
2 Of course it matters! It's Mario!

1 What?	It's so beautiful!
2 What???

1 Poor Father . . .	Don't worry, Gina! Mummy and Daddy love each other.

1 What's happening to me? What are you doing?	You came in for your EEG. You fell asleep and well, I took the liberty of...I'm sorry. You looked like a wreck Trevor.

1 Millions of people around the world get on busses every day. When was the last time you heard of anybody anywhere dying on a public transit bus?	Okay Mr. Statistics I've got one for you. What's the most common cause of death for adults over the age of eighteen?
2 Please. Heart attack. That was easy street.	Second most common?
3 Skin cancer.	Eighty third most common.
4 Pitbull attacks.	You just made that up.

1 The boss won't notice me doing a bad job because I'm not. Even if the boss thought I was slacking I'd know right away.	Yeah, how's that?
2 I have my connections	Really? Do tell.
3 Gwen.

1 Last time anybody saw this woman she was alive. You seem to certain she's dead.	I saw her drowning inside the car, detective.

1 You win! Okay pull over.	But... I thought...
2 If what I've heard is true this could be the last time for a long long time. Besides we've got a whole seven minutes before the next one. Clock's ticking. Tick-tock...

1 You're alive...	Yes. Now go back to sleep. You're driving the rest of the way to gramma's remember?

1 What happens if I'm convicted of Kirsty's murder?	Well they'd have to prove it in a court of law for one thing-

1 What's under that sheet...?	You probably don't remember the night we played. Your first year as husband and wife.

1 -Tawny.	Whew. You bounce right back don't you?
2 What do you mean?

1 Whoa, I have serious space issues, dude. What do you want?	I... think we need to talk, there's something really strange going on...
2 Hey you're the guy from down the hall.	Come on, quit fucking around. Listen it's about... what we did together last night.
3 WHAT?!

1 Which don't sound like such a bad goddamn idea, John.	Huh?  Whadda you mean?
2 Well, we gotta work this thing out, John.  It's a goddamn mess an' I'm halfway to doing serious time in the joint an' the TV lady's so stuck on you she don't want it to come out you stole her purse because it might break the heart of millions.  Looka those maniacs, willya?  They love you, for Chrissake!	I don't need to be a hero, LaPlante, but I can't face people... the looks in their eyes... after the trust they gave me!
3 Great!  You make this big goddamn mess, then ya jump.  Beautiful! Listen, John, I was there at the hospital today, I seen you with those little bastards .	It was you!  I thought I heard...
4 I'm not saying I hate sick people or anything but I hate being <u>around</u> them if you know what I mean.  There <u>you</u> go, you <u>inspire</u> this kid to <u>live</u>.  I probably woulda vomited on him.	Allen?  He... he's okay?

1 Listen, now that I owe you twenty-five hundred bucks plus, how about loaning me twenty for cab fare?	So you can call me "naive," Mister LaPlante.
2 Hey, you could call me "Bernie," forget the "Mister LaPlante" stuff.  You are naive.	I read the probation report.  It's not good.  I think you're going... going to prison, Mister... Bernie. I know that scares you but..
3 TAXI!  HEY, TAXI!  Well, at least I'm gonna get my goddamn million bucks.  TAXI FOR CHRISSAKE!

1 Bill, I...	DON'T SAY "BILL," BERNIE!  DON'T SAY ONE WORD!  DIDN'T I SAY "ONE WORD AND YOU'RE FIRED?"
2 I...	YOU KNOW WHY?  BECAUSE IT'LL BE AN <u>EXCUSE</u>!  IT'LL BE "BERNIE LAPLANTE EXCUSE NUMBER FOUR THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND SIX."  NO, FOUR THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND TWELVE.  THAT'S HOW MANY EXCUSES YOU HAVE GIVEN ME, I KEEP TRACK OF THEM ELECTRONICALLY. I HEARD THEM ALL, BERNIE.
3 Bill, I got some legal problems and I...	THAT'S IT!  YOU TALKED!  YOU'RE FIRED!  OUTTA HERE!  GET OUTTA HERE!
4 Bill, listen...	OUT!  I TOLDJA.  JESUS CHRIST, I GOT CUSTOMERS WAITING!  AN' YOU WERE GONNA GO OUT LIKE THAT?  AN' MEET THE PUBLIC IN STOCKING-FUCKING-FEET?
5 Bill, I got financial problems and...	I DON'T CARE ABOUT <u>YOUR</u> PROBLEMS, I'M GONNA THINK ABOUT <u>MY</u> PROBLEMS. <u>YOU'RE</u> ONE A MY PROBLEMS.  GET OUT! OUT!  OUT!

1 This guy, this "friend" your mother's seeing, he's a fireman, huh?  He ever... spend the night, whatsisname?	Sometimes.  His name's Elliot.  He saved a guy's life one time.  In a fire.
2 Oh yeah?  A hero, huh?  Was he in the 'Nam, this guy Elliot?	"The Nomm"?  What's that?
3 It was this war.  Viet Nam.  Doesn't matter.	Were you in it?  In the war?
4 You never saw that picture, huh?	What picture?
5 Me in my uniform.  Used to be on the bookcase.

1 Uh, no.  But I, uh, wonder if you could up support... support a program to help the needy and...	John, I'm sure she could support just about anything.  I think I'll see you to your room. A sort of bodyguard.  Make sure no harm comes to you.

1 "A little mistake"!	No, John, you're too hard on yourself.  I've got the creep here, the guy who's...

1 There's a lot of confusion around what went on last night, it's not clear...	You said all the passengers were accounted for...
2 Apparently the guy who pulled you out wasn't a passenger...

1 Whaddaya mean what do I wanna know? I wanna know everything.  Who's this screwball LaPlante for Pete's sake, what the hell's he doing out there, auditioning for the priesthood? You're supposed to be on top of this, Gale, don't...  "Quit!"  You can't quit!  It's unprofessional!	Quit?  She wants to quit?
2 Listen, Gale, I know you're emotionally involved.  Don't be emotionally involved, be professional.  No, Gale, you are not a hardbitten, cynical hard-ass, you just think you are.  You are a goddamn cream puff!  Try and be a hard-ass!

1 I didn't say I thought we should have saved him..	You didn't?
2 I said I wished it had at least occurred to me to consider saving him.

1 Look at that.  You can't buy better protection than that.  That there is your Man's Best Friend.	How are they with kids?
2 They're great with kids.  They love 'em.  They eat 'em up.  I'm kidding.	So this really does the trick, eh?
3 Friend, that animal will go after whoever's approaching the sound of that whistle.  And God help whoever it is.  Because that dog will not let up until there's dead meat on the ground.  Put your faith in that, pal.

1 And how are things with your lady friend, if I may call her that?	Oh, fine.  She's gone away for a little while and when she comes back I've sort of resolved to really tell her how much I care for her.
2 That's terrific.  Don't be afraid to be demonstrative.  You're sounding a lot more confident than when we last spoke.	I am.  I'm really feeling pretty good.  I have a much stronger sense of how far I've come.
3 As long as you keep remembering why.	Well, we talked about the whole disapproval thing.
4 The whole disapproval thing.  If you allow yourself to get into a situation where someone else's potential disapproval becomes the focal point of your life -- then you're back to a life of fear, aren't you?  -- You're a prisoner to that again, and that isn't much of a life.	I understand that.
5 And please, don't for God's sake misinterpret that as being the voice of discouragement in any way --	No, no, no, no.
6 On the contrary -- this is tremendous.  I mean, we're all frightened to death of disapproval and we're constantly hiding behind these layers we manufacture for ourselves -- and I'm not saying we should, you know, <u>declare</u> ourselves unhesitatingly to our fellow human beings in the interests of total openness and honesty --	That would be stupid.
7 That would be monumentally stupid. All I'm saying is --	-- a sense of proportion.
8 A sense of proportion.

1 Yeah, right -- I really have to go to bed.	I think we should talk first.

1 Mommy!	It's okay, baby, the police are coming.

1 Neil -- what --	Mom, <u>there's somebody in the</u> <u>house</u>!
2 Honey --	Mom, I heard someone downstairs!

1 Do you remember who gave us this?	No.
2 There's no card or anything.

1 Did the cleaning woman come?	Yeah -- she did a good job.  This glass looks brand-new.

1 Who was that?	I'm having the floor fixed,
2 And what was that neighbor guy doing here?	Philip, what are <u>you</u> doing here?
3 Look, I think we should work things out.

1 Are we gonna buy this house?	Do you have enough money?

1 You knew a second ago.  <u>Who</u> started it?	-- A man.

1 Lieutenant Bedsoe?	Not now.  I'm busy.

1 I'm in the middle of an interrogation, Captain.	Interrogation's over, Bedsoe.
2 What?	Cut him loose.  The D.A. says you ain't got shit on this guy.
3 You don't understand.  About seven years ago we found the body of a guy named Vasilnic in Jersey.  A week later in the parking lot of Madison Square Garden we found Iman Fasil. Three days after that Luman Castageer was found in an alley.  The fourth body we've never been able to identify.  All four men died from decapitation.  Nash was our primary suspect -- but he disappeared.	It's circumstantial.

1 Seven years ago I interviewed a guy. He said he saw two men fighting in an alley with swords.  One cut off the others head.  He shot the surviving guy twenty times and he got right back up and stabbed him.	Maybe he was a lousy shot.

1 The river.	That's all?
2 Yes.

1 That was two hundred and fifty years ago -- and the pain still scars your heart.  Would you live that pain again?	No.  What am I to do?
2 The only thing you can do.  You must end it.

1 We had a bargain.  You promised.	I lied.

1 Where did you get it?	It's mine.  It's been in my family for years.  It belonged to my great, great, great grandmother.

1 You have an interesting accent. Where are you from?	Why?

1 Where will you go now?	It will end tonight.
2 Must you fight him?	He will not stop until it is over.

1 Do you?  Then why don't you go out? Meet someone.  Make a life for yourself instead of hiding away in the past?	I like my work.
2 I'm having some people over tonight for dinner -- I'd like you come.	We'll see.

1 I'm glad you've come home, Conner.	Me too.

1 Good afternoon, Mr. Parker.	Good afternoon...  ... Shirley.
2 Would you like to deposit this in your account?	No.  The money, please.
3 This check is for sixteen thousand dollars.  That's a lot of cash to be carrying around.	I can take care of myself.
4 Alright.  It's going to take a few minutes.  I have to call and verify the funds.

1 Worst case, it's a bloodbath.  The detectives come out with Smith's computer, and we go directly to jail, do not pass Go.	Maybe Glen already picked up the disks.
2 I took the call from Glen personally. They're still in Smith's house.

1 <u>Get on the floor</u>!	I have contacts in Los Angeles.  Lawyers and judges who can help you.

1 Jesus.  What is this?	Are you totally stupid?  What does it look like?

1 Yeah.  I'm Rooney.	We had an awful lot of shooting.  You need a doctor in there?

1 You got a sniper out there, gonna shoot me?	Only if you try to grab me.  We could've shot you from the wall.

1 That's right.  That's a good idea, Mars.	Find something:  Extension cords, rope, wire--we'll have to tie them tight.
2 Find something, Kevin.  Don't just stand there.  And tie this bastard, too.  I don't want him waking up and goin' Rambo on us.

1 Are you out of your mind?	You fucked up, Glen.

1 All right.  Now the second one.	First my girls.  I get my girls, you get the other disk.

1 We can't carry him.	You go, Thomas.  You get out, and I'll stay with Daddy.
2 I'm not gonna leave you!	Go!  If you get out, maybe you can help the police!

1 Please get away from me.	Mars?  What are you doing?

1 I'm not going to wake him.  I don't even know that I can.	Just one question.  Please.
2 He.  Can't.  Answer.

1 Louise?	Go, Chief.
2 Call Jane for me.  She's at the little Thai place.	I know the one.
3 Tell her I'm almost home.

1 Excuse me?  <u>You</u> requested our help.  You turned over command --	And now I'm taking it back.  We're getting Smith out of the house.

1 We've got to get those kids out of there!	Not until the man calls.
2 Those kids are in there with a fucking psychopath!  He <u>kills</u> people!	They've been in there all day.

1 I don't see any people names.  It's all businesses.	Try Al.  See if you can open Al.

1 Marlon and Al....	We want them.  You will not let anyone go into that house--or anything come out-- until my people recover these disks.
2 I can't control what happens.  The Sheriffs are running the scene.	You will re-assume command.  In two hours, a group of my people will arrive at York Estates.  You will tell the Sheriffs that they are an FBI tactical team.

1 Also, could you remember to use the service entrance at all times?	Of course.

1 Here, here, a thousand US dollars - fifty thousand francs for my family. To let us drive off to the Mille Collines.	How many in your family?
2 Six.

1 You're fucking black! You're not even a nigger, you're African!  They're not staying to stop this thing. They're gonna fly right out of here with their people.	Their people?
2 They're only taking the whites.

1 I will see what I can do.	I admire you, General. How do you keep command of your men amidst such madness?
2 I am strong, Paul, like a lion.	I wish I were like you. Look at my staff, they won't work, they listen to no one.

1 You are a marked man.	How so.
2 The Americans, and the UN they have you as a war criminal. You are on a list.	I am on a list! What list?
3 When the Europeans left, their soldiers gathered lists.

1 Holy shit! Holy shit.	What is it?

1 Gregoire it is good to see you back to work.	Please, except my humblest apologies...
2 Don't worry. I have a job this morning. I must go to visit my good friend George Rutagunda. You know George?

1 Are you trying to make a fool of me? There are no Europeans left in that hotel. Get me the names of all the cockroaches in there.	That will take time.
2 You don't have time. If I do not have the names, so that I can pick out the traitors, then I will kill everyone here in this car park. Get in there now.

1 I'm afraid you will have to move room.	Move? Where to?
2 I'm going to put you on the third floor.	The third floor are low class rooms.
3 Yes they are. However if the army return they will expect important people such as yourself to be in these grand rooms.	Pack the bags, we have to move.
4 Also, this is your bill for the last week.

1 Paul! Paul's eyes adjust, he recognizes many of his neighbors, all crowded into this small room. Then he sees their friends Odette and her husband Jean Baptiste.	Jean Baptiste!

1 Any luck?	No answer. Please send someone to get them, please.
2 I'll try.

1 I have to go out to get food.	Go out! Where?
2 To Rutagunda's place. It is close by.	No, no.
3 I have to, Tatiana, we are only as valuable as the service we provide.	You cannot go alone.
4 I'm not going alone. I'll take Gregoire with me. He's a good Hutu, and he wants to impress me now.

1 We are almost out of water.	We are almost out of everything.

1 Twelve are dead.	How dead?

1 Out? Where are you going?	I do not know, sir. I think they will kill us all.

1 Easy. You've got to keep still for a bit, the last thing we need is a coronary.	You're the Doctor, sweetheart. 'Guess the atropine worked, then.
2 Convinced all those that needed convincing: you're an official dead lady.	And what's Steven's status?
3 Still alive, but it's just a matter of time. And then will come your miraculous resurrection --	-- "oh, no, Officer, I'm very much alive -- just a joke to beat my husband at his own clever game -- What? What do you mean he's dead? It's all my fault, I may as well have killed him myself!"
4 "But you didn't, Ma'am. We have all these witnesses that saw..." well, whoever it ends up being that finally shoots him --	-- the James Dean wannabe with the hair trigger --
5 -- or might turn out to be -- very big surprise -- that Jenzen girl. The little bitch has the right stuff. She nearly put a bullet in Price right after your "demise."	So what stopped her?
6 It's complicated. But don't worry --	-- there's already been way too many complications for a very simple plan. You ever find out what happened to Melissa Marr?
7 Not yet.	So we don't even know if she's alive or dead --
8 -- Price killed her, there's no other explanation --	-- there's plenty: for all we know, Steven's got her spying on us right now --
9 -- bullshit --	-- the whole thing is falling apart!

1 Something just must've...frightened her, that's all.	Yeah...something.

1 Even if I were inclined, I've had better -- and a lot safer -- opportunities to kill off a wife.	Three times, to be exact.
2 Excuse me?	Accidents. Fatal. Each of your prior wives, so we've been informed.
3 Can't imagine by who. I don't suppose the truth would interest you: that I've never had another wife but Evelyn.

1 -- I did: down here.	And I think that's case --

1 New wrinkle on an old theory for treating schizophrenia. 19th Century, I think: what would drive a sane man mad should make a madman sane. The Vannacutt version was: bombard the patient with aural and visual stimuli far more frightening than any hallucination they could ever produce, it'd traumatize 'em back to "normalcy."	Did it work?

1 Pritchett!	Over here!

1 And you're not really as large and useless as you seem.	I'm better than that.
2 Don't push it.

1 -- you lose either way, Price --	-- listen to the man --

1 Don't think it's even an issue.	We're safe?

1 So, what? The thing with the glass? Price did that?	I hope not.

1 -- asking the wrong guy -- wasn't me who closed it.	Sure it wasn't. Hey, anybody else here make their living with thrills'n'chills for the kiddies? Don't raise your hands all at once.
2 Huh. And here I had a completely different theory.	Really? Well, let it rip.
3 Oh, no-no-no -- much more bang for everyone's buck to nail the bitch --	-- the sadistic prick --
4 -- in the act.

1 I don't know, Ms. Jenzen.	Well, who's the damn thing <u>from</u>?
2 Messenger just dropped it off. No return address.	You didn't think to ask?
3 I was in the middle of --	-- being utterly fucking useless, what else is new.

1 I'm ready now.	Alright, Mr. Pritchett, let me just sign the damn thing.

1 Jennifer-Jenzen-Executive-V.P.- Paragon-Pictures.	Very good. Well, I think I can say with complete honesty: I've never heard of any of you.

1 -- listen to me, goddamnit --	-- no more --

1 Won't do any good.	Why not?

1 Please.....anyone....help me?	Melissa...?
2 For the love of God....please...?	Melissa, it's Sara -- is that you?
3 Sara...?	Keep talking, I'll find you!
4 Something....happened --	-- I'm coming --
5 -- something horrible...I don't understand --

1 It looks delicious...	Why don't you pass me your plate?

1 Mommy, the leprechauns drank the milk last night.	Well I bet you they're happy.

1 Where are we going to go, mommy?	We're going to go someplace new.
2 What about all my other stuff?	We'll get it later.

1 Look daddy!  It's empty!	That's great, honey.

1 What's the matter?	Will, maybe we should have separate bedrooms for a while.
2 Oh come on...	I just, I don't know...
3 What will Aubrey think?	Aubrey knows more about us than you think.

1 The heater's here.	Were you fooling with the power?
2 No.	Didn't you just see the power go off and on?  I just had a bulb break on me!

1 Oh my God where is she!	She's gone!
2 Aubrey?!  Aubrey?!

1 Are you all right?	I'm ok.

1 Is white meat all right for you, Mr. Shea?	White meat will be fine...

1 Concentrate!  She can hear you!	Come back to us honey, don't be afraid!

1 What...amulet?	Did you remove anything in the cellar!

1 Do you have any other physical evidence, that we can look at?	Not really.  Oh, wait a minute.

1 Hello?	You wanted a story.  You got it.  Turn on the TV now.  And then get your ass down here ...  ...
2 Doc?  ...  Doc ... Hello?

1 Hold on.  Hold on, please.  I need talk to you.	It's nothing to do with me.  I wasn't even with him.

1 Great.  Thanks.  You gonna have one?	I'm trying to quit.
2 Oh, go on.  Have one.  Fuck it.  You think you're going to live forever?

1 But I don't know what's going on.	Maybe not.  But you know more than I do. You know something about this box. Something about a statue?
2 Yeah.  I found it.  I knew held like it and I figured ...	Woah.  Wait a minute.  Who?  The kid?
3 No.  JP.  My last boyfriend?  He like owns the club.  You know?  You were there?  He bought the statue.	That you found.  What do you mean you found it?

1 ... Let it define you.  Whatever it is. Most of the roses die behind the bar. This is the first I've given out for nearly a month.	No.  Really?

1 You see, we're not so dissimilar.	But how in God's name ...
2 God?  My God was diamond and black light.  And I was his Dark Pope.  All that is changed.  A terrible beauty is born.  With a place at my right hand for a man of your tastes.

1 You're saying you want us to beat them to the crystal and save the world from financial disarray.	Something like that.
2 Well, forget about it.  Hawk and I are going to Rio.  We're hurt, we're tired, and a hero ain't nothing but a sandwich.  Right, buddy?...	Hudson, God's given you a gift for cat burglary, you can t just...

1 I didn't know how to tell you.  A couple brokers stopped in for Stoley Spritzers one night.  Next thing I know Fast Track Digest votes us "Watering Hole of the Month."  Now, I'm shopping for Aqua Salmon wallpaper.	I read about these people in Newsweek.  Where's all the regulars, Crazy Jeff Cava, the Todd sisters, Indian Joe?  Where's Ed Kranepool's autograph?  Captain Bob's steering wheel?
2 Hey, get this irritable guy a cappuccino.  I gotta go be a boss.

1 They record everything their video surveillance takes in...	Yes, master-thief, I can see that. You said something about a plan...

1 You bastard.  You fucked my freedom for a lousy job.	But I said I was sorry....
2 No sweat, Alex, you only made the biggest mistake of <u>my</u> life.  What was your per-diem?	Don't act like you've never committed a crime before, Hawkins?  I know, I made call, when Anna tracked me down I...

1 I'm a ghost.  Boo.	I don't want to sound immature, but we were here first...

1 With all due respect to that great blouse, why didn't I cut out her heart?	Close call, but she's our only way of keeping tabs on that damn mysterious Vatican organization. Hawk, it's time to go to the principal's office....

1 Oh, the shit is going to hit the fa--	Fantastic.  Perfection.  The Vatican extends its jealousy to the lucky bidder.

1 This is bueno.  They had the worst ketchup in prison.....uh...	Prison?
2 I was the Warden?	How long were you in?
3 Let's just say, I never saw E.T.	Wow, you were "in the joint." "Doing hard time."  It's funny, but that excites me.  I seem to have a thing for sinners.
4 I seem to have a thing for sinning. sinning.  Check please....

1 You better believe I can.  I'm sick of people telling me what I have to do.	It's that kind of selfish attitude that...
2 Selfish attitude?  I'm just some guy who wants a little nap and a cappuccino for when he wakes up, not too much foam...	You re not "some guy" anymore, Hudson.  Right now, you're the only guy.  Without your help, I....

1 How many times do I have to say it?  I didn't put the hit on Little Eddie... Never had anything against that kooky chimp.  I actually found him, "endearing."	Sure.  Face down.  Two endearing shots to the back of the head. That's your mark, man.  What did Little Eddie ever do to...

1 So, Captain Hawk, in one of your paws you got a gold bar worth about 8 thou.  In the autre, you got lead that won't get you gelato.	Surely a master-thief like you can tell the difference.

1 Why do you show your parole officer such disrespect? Especially after I got you such a nice job.	What job?

1 Big girls don't cry-I-eye.	Two minutes, 35 seconds.  Damnit, I'm involved in this thing, so I just wanna know what this thing is. I wanna be treated as an adult.

1 Damnit, I hate this!  I'm a cat burglar!  Nobody said anything about this fight-to-the-death shit.	Too bad.

1 Something short.	Sharp.
2 Snappy.	With a little jazz.
3 The Shazzammeter!	The Hipster!

1 About seven minutes.	Yeah, I was all wet about your idea man... Well, thanks for being so generous... It is human, and you are divine... No, he's no faker. He's the 100% real McCoy beware-of- imitations genuine article: the guy is a real moron --

1 -- these were the values that were instilled in me while I was growing up in a little town you've probably never heard of --	Mind if I join you?

1 Sid found me the icepack.	Let me hold it, or you'll have a real shiner.
2 Thanks. People seem to be pretty hot over this imbecile story.	...I'm sorry.
3 Oh, it isn't your fault, Amy. You're the one person who's been standing by me through all this.

1 ...You son of a --	Norville!
2 Huh?!

1 Whatever! It's no dig on you, Archer, but this story is hot and you're no longer on top of it. Why, it's the scoop of the century -- the other papers won't have the Gunderson dope 'til tomorrow -- The Allemeinischer Zeitung, Le Figaro, they'll be choking on our dust come mornin' --	You're fools, both of you! It's obvious they're out to crucify Norville! They're trying to destroy him!
2 Amy -- take a break. You've worked hard on this story -- heck, you broke it for us! But it's passed you by and Smith here has taken up the slack.

1 ...What's your pleasure, buddy?	Forty-fourth floor, and it's very --
2 Forty-four, the top brass floor say, buddy! What takes fifty years to get up to the top floor and thirty seconds to get down?	I --
3 Waring Hudsucker! Na-ha-ha-ha-ha! Say, buddy!

1 I'm sorry, buddy... I'm sorry...	Buzz... off! Ha-ha-ha-ha!

1 -- So we'd gone out to the Hamptons and the garden was in positive ruins!	That must have been quite a disappointment, Mrs. Mussburger.
2 Disappointment? J'etais destroyee! I was in bed for a week! Positively sick with fury! I called in the gardener and said, 'Monsieur Gonzalez, either those azaleas come up next spring or you are terminee!

1 But --	Get out of my sight.

1 Finally.	-- So if you think it's appropriate, I'd like to bounce the idea off a few people at lunch --

1 She's got other problems, of course...	...Her mother needs an operation...
2 ...adenoids.	No, Bennie: Lumbago.

1 I think you need some help.	I'm afraid so.
2 Ti-Joseph?

1 Does she suffer?	I don't know.  I prefer to think of her as a sleepwalker who can never be awakened -- feeling nothing, knowing nothing.

1 Don't worry.  I wasn't missed.  The only important man here is the owner.	Mr. Holland?
2 Yes, the redoubtable Paul.  He has the plantation, and I, as you must have noticed, have all the charm.	I don't know.  He spoke to me last night on the boat. I liked him very much.
3 Ah, yes, our Paul, strong and silent and very sad -- quite the Byronic character. Perhaps I ought to cultivate it.

1 She's dead.  The dead ought to be buried.	But she's not dead, Wes.
2 You know what she is!  That's death -- no mind, no senses -- no love, no hate, no feeling -- nothing!	Please, Wes, do as I ask.  You must rest, you must sleep.

1 I suppose so.  Yes.	And charming?
2 I've never given it much thought.	Don't.  It will save you a great deal of trouble and other people a great  unhappiness.

1 You think I love Jessica and want her back. It is like you to think that -- clean, decent thinking.	She was beautiful.
2 I hated her.

1 But I assure you, Father Walters, Miss Connell had no idea of the consequences when she went there.	Paul, we're not trying to blame Miss Connell.  It isn't a question of blame.  It's a question of what we are to do with Jessica.  The commissioner is very concerned.

1 And speaking of which, you have those market share charts Mr. Shackley was asking about?	Gotcha George, not a problem. Tomorrow. Hey, you want to start covering the old filmed entertainment sector yourself?
2 Ben you know that's your territory - and I wouldn't dream to trespass - you're the expert. Hey, how do you think Paramount's gonna do with that Blatty novel, what's it called? The Exorcist?	Overpriced bomb, cost over $6 million -- no stars, and no one's into the horror genre these days anyway. I'm advising the company recommend reducing positions there. It's disaster films that are gonna stay at the top.
3 Brilliant. Hey, you heading out a little early today?	Got a meeting uptown.
4 Right o'.	Up the organization!  Bastard.

1 Oh yeah. Musk, or something. You like it?	Hmm. Good night.

1 Oh lord. You think I'm so dense. And now you want to be seen with your dense wife at the cocktail party. You want to wear that ridiculous shirt which doesn't go with those pants at all. You want to wear that, and you want me to shake hands with your friends and make conversation and dress up in an outfit that shows a lot of cleavage and you're not going to accord me the respect of talking honestly about this... You don't really know what this feels like.	Sure I do. Do I know what loneliness feels like? Sure I do. I know a lot about it, if that's what you mean.
2 Benjamin. That's supposed to explain it?

1 So how's school treating you?	All right.
2 Classes?	Good.
3 Grades?	Fine.
4 Anyone special? You know...	Hnnn.
5 Well it's good to see you -- we miss you around the house and all, but this St. Peter's, it's top of the line, eh?	Yeah.
6 You know Paul, I've been thinking, maybe this is as good a time as any to have a little talk, you know, about -- well --

1 Oh jeez, Benjie. Well, here you are.	Damn right, but where the hell were you?
2 What are you talking about?	Don't bullshit me around, Janey. Jesus Christ, I waited around for more than half an hour, in nothing but my boxer shorts, and -- and what's all that about? What the hell happened?

1 Your toes cold?	Yeah.

1 Good shit.	Sure is good shit. It's opiated. I had it in my chamber for a while. I was smoking this other --
2 It's what?	Don't fret, Benjie, it's --
3 Darn it, Dave.

1 You want to come in, get a cup of coffee -- warm up? I can either walk you home, or you could crash in the guest room.	Sure. Maybe coffee.
2 Phone's out. I hope the pipe's --

1 Thanks again. For the dinner.	Thanks for eating it. I don't know why I even pretend I can cook.
2 I used to know how to cook.	It's not like we're too busy.

1 Arise and shine, young Hood.	I hope you changed the water in that bong from last night.
2 The water, as you call it, is a special mixture of amaretto and Ben&Ben blended for just the exact chemical interaction with the last of our precious Thai stick.

1 No candy for me?	Groovy.  Young master of the revels, a treat for our hostess?

1 I'm in love with Libbets Casey.	Yeah, well, you've been in love with like every other girl here, I was wondering when you'd get around to Libbets.
2 It's beyond mere physical attraction.	That's good, because I don't think Libbets is capable of the sex act.
3 Truly? Do speak.	My diagnosis is messed in the head. A poor little rich girl -- I mean check out the jeans and fur look. And lend your ears to this brutality. Like her mom and step dad and her step-sisters are going to Switzerland to ski over Thanksgiving break -- and like they didn't invite her!
4 How do you know this shit?	They did it last year too. It's like traditional or something. They've got this humongoid Park Ave apartment and she just holes up there with a wad of cash.  Aren't the hugely wealthy sad?
5 You think Francis is going to beat me to the punch here?	Since he sleeps with every girl you ever show an interest in, why don't you just keep your Libbets thing a secret from him?
6 Good thinking Marge.

1 Maybe we can mess around. You know, only if you want to...	I don't know.
2 Why did you -- with Sandy?	I don't know.
3 You like him? He worships you.

1 Well, you can...	Hey Sandy, what were you blowing up out there? Your mom was pretty p.o.'d.
2 All my model planes.	The ones you built?
3 They were old. And they couldn't fly anyhow. I'm going to get a radio-controlled airplane at Christmas, and then I'll stuff it full of m-80s and then fly it into Mrs. Burgess's English class and blow it up.	I have to go to the bathroom.
4 Yeah.

1 Didn't want to miss anything.	Detective Dormer's not leaving for a few hours.
2 Good.	Maybe you could drive him to Spencer's.
3 Sure.

1 Guess that's what they call Alaskan hospitality.	Don't worry about him...

1 But here's the thing.  I retraced your exact steps according to your statement. You couldn't have seen Detective Eckhart from there.  I mean, not in that fog.	Then change it.
2 How much closer would you say you were?	I don't remember.
3 Five feet?  Seven feet?

1 No.	No fibers, skin flakes, hairs...
2 Like I said, no.  We know about those things up here.

1 No.	One of the paperbacks we found in Kay Connell's knapsack.

1 We'll talk when we get back to Seattle.	When's that, a week?  Two weeks?...  We have to figure out a plan of action now.
2 You know my plan of action.	To do nothing.
3 That's right.	Dammit, Will.  Warfield had me locked up in his office again for five hours yesterday.  <i>Five</i> hours.  Asking all kinds of questions...
4 He's asking everybody questions.	But he's zeroing in on <i>me</i>.  On <i>us</i>. Everyone's talking about it.
5 He's just rattling your cage.	Well, I gotta tell you.  With a wife, three kids, and a pension plan in the balance, it's rattling hard.
6 We say nothing.  It goes away.  Simple as that.

1 One of your cases?	Me and Hap.  A year and a half ago.  I knew the second I met Dobbs that he was guilty.  Smug, cold.  Dead eyes.  We had circumstantial evidence, but nothing to tie him to it.  Nothing concrete.  Went over every inch of that apartment.

1 You want me to take you somewhere?	Long as it's fun.

1 No.	But you wanted to.
2 I was a mentor to her.

1 Wild card.	Drop the gun, Walter.

1 I was waiting for you...	Listen to me.

1 Your melancholy eyes...	What a pair we are. We deserve each other, don't we?
2 We are a pair, and that's what counts.

1 Stop pestering me then!	Oh, Lestat. I must do more than that. I've brought a present for you.
2 Then I hope its a beautiful woman with endowments you will never possess.

1 We're immortal. You've always known that.	Tell me why...you've got to tell me...

1 You never talked to me like that - in all these years.	And you never cried -
2 I can't bear it when you do - I would die rather than lose you Louis. I would die the way he died.

1 Are they my kind Louis? Dolls never change either.	You are neither, Claudia. Now stop this --

1 Do you think I would let them harm you?	No, you would not, Louis. Danger hold you to me.
2 Love holds you to me. And we are in danger, not you.	Love?

1 What do you want from me?	I've come to answer your prayers. You want to die, don't you? Life has no meaning anymore, does it?

1 Come, you're going to feed now.	I want a woman.

1 Have you ever been caught?	Of course not. It's so easy you almost feel sorry for them.

1 The girl, Lestat -	I know. Let her alone.

1 Claudia, Claudia, listen to me. You're ill, my precious and I'm going to give you what you need to get well.	Lestat, what do you mean?

1 I have to go now Lestat...	You remember how I was, Louis.. the vampire Lestat...
2 Yes. I remember...

1 Shall we go on?	He did it to make you stay with him!
2 Perhaps. He knew me. He knew I would love her more than the waking world. But there was more to it than that. Perhaps in the end he did it -- to show me that he could. For he lavished affection on her, there was no doubt about that. Life was very different with madame Claudia, as you can imagine...

1 Yes.	What do you think she is, Madeleine? A doll?
2 A child who can't die...

1 Listen to me. He's here.	Who? Who is here?

1 I thought you were out of town!	What are you doing in my closet?

1 He's not coming. I thought he was just...	Julie, you left four messages... Four.
2 But, he said he'd try.	He said he'd try. Try is like maybe. Try is nothing!
3 He does work hard.	Work hard, huh? He's breaking your heart just because he can.  And I don't want to have to say I told you so...
4 Then, don't.

1 You get any sleep at all?	Some.

1 I know I don't want to stay in here.	We'll be better off in the open. If we stick together, maybe we can kill this creep for good.

1 Ray, I can't...	Can't what?
2 I just feel like some part of me hasn't healed up enough to go back. Like some critical piece is missing. Please understand...

1 You're the most beautiful woman in the bar tonight, Jules.	Tyrell, you are an unstoppable force of nature.
2 That's right. It's how the species survives. You'll never convince me otherwise.  Wanna dance?

1 This was not my idea.	What?
2 I said, this...Do you want a drink?

1 Estes came after me with a gaffing hook.	He's in it with Willis?
2 I guess so.

1 Guess the capital of Brazil --	Rio, baby!

1 Julie, is everything cool? Karla said...	I said we start having fun. And that means now.

1 Don't really have the market for something like this...  I can go two...two-fifty.	Make it three hundred. And throw that in, too.

1 I'm just saying what all of you are thinking. It's bad enough gettin' rained out without having to hold her hand the whole time.	You don't have to be a jerk.

1 I took it for granted you gentlemen were refugees as are my other guests.	This is General Nikolas Pherides, Commander of the Third Army. I'm Oliver Davis.  To be perfectly frank with you, we didn't expect to find anyone living here.
2 It is my home.  My name is Hugo Albrecht.

1 The ancient Greeks had just as good an explanation -- that the gods sent the plague to punish mortals for harboring Vrykolaka --	They used to believe that sort of thing in the mountain villages. Some still do --

1 Perhaps I had better stay. I am tired.	I'll get Ida to make up your bed.

1 I know it must be hard. But you have relatives in London --you've got a whole world of living, ahead of you --	No one can take my father's place.

1 What are you doing?	I was looking for you.

1 Come, Thea, if you're going to claim him as your father you've got to make up your mind. They'll be leaving any minute.	I don't know. As a child. I longed for a father and now - I don't know 

1 Woman, what are you doing here?	I wanted to be sure of something, General -- something that has always preyed on my mind. I have a horror of being buried alive and awakening to find myself shut in - entombed  imprisoned..
2 He sleeps quietly. He died with a wine glass in his hand -- he died laughing -- a brave man, Drossos, like his father before him.	Because he was a brave man - because I liked him -- I came here to be sure.
3 He's dead enough. God rest his soul.

1 You are a happy man Oliver. You have but one world to live in - the world of today. I have two worlds. I have that old dark world of peasant ignorance and superstition in which I was brought up and a new world which the army gave me  a world of mathematics, gun ranges,logistics, tactics, strategy.	It doesn't seem to bother you much, General.
2 I will be glad to leave this island. It has too much of that old dark world about it. I will be glad to leave it and that girl 	Thea?

1 Theodosia --	Not Theodosia. Theodosia's daughter -- your daughter.

1 I'm not crying, Mr. Potter.	Well, you're begging, and that's a whole lot worse.
2 All I'm asking is thirty days more . . .

1 Bert, now listen to me. Ernie, will you take me over to my mother's house? Bert, listen!  It's that fellow there  he says he's an angel  he's tried to hypnotize me.	I hate to do this, fella.

1 What did you say?	You've never been born. You don't exist. You haven't a care in the world.

1 You see, George, you were not there to stop Gower from putting that poison into the . . .	What do you mean, I wasn't there? I remember distinctly . . .

1 Where? I don't see a thing.	Oh, I forgot. You haven't got your wings yet. Now look, I'll help you out. Concentrate. Begin to see something?

1 I want the Board to know that George gave up his trip to Europe to help straighten things out here these past few months. Good luck to you at school, George.	Thanks.
2 Now we come to the real purpose of this meeting  to appoint a successor to our dear friend, Peter Bailey.

1 On V-J Day he wept and prayed again.	Joseph, now show him what happened today.
2 Yes, sir.

1 Oh, oh. Sam Wainwright! How are you? When did you get here?	Oh, this afternoon. I thought I'd give the kids a treat.
2 Old college graduate now, huh?	Yeah  old Joe College Wainwright, they call me. Well, freshman, looks like you're going to make it after all.
3 Yep.

1 He's gone. Don't worry. His name is Welch. He don't come in to my place no more.	Oh  Welch. That's what I get for praying.
2 The last time he come in here. You hear that, Nick?

1 No . . . No . . . No. . .	Don't hurt my ear again!

1 Father, did I act like that when I graduated from high school?	Pretty much. You know, George, wish we could send Harry to college with you. Your mother and I talked it over half the night.
2 We have that all figured out. You see, Harry'll take my job at the Building and Loan, work there four years, then he'll go.	He's pretty young for that job.
3 Well, no younger than I was.	Maybe you were born older, George.
4 How's that?	I say, maybe you were born older. I suppose you've decided what you're going to do when you get out of college.
5 Oh, well, you know what I've always talked about  build things . . . design new buildings  plan modern cities  all that stuff I was talking about.	Still after that first million before you're thirty.
6 No, I'll settle for half that in cash.

1 Oh . . . me? Oh, well, I feel funny enough already, with all these kids.	Aw, come on. Be a sport. Just dance with her one time and you'll give her the thrill of her life.

1 Violet Bick!	I'm not going to go, George. I changed my mind.

1 George, was it a nice wedding? Gosh, I wanted to be there.	Yeah . . .  . . . you can take this one off now.

1 You wouldn't mind living in the nicest house in town, buying your wife a lot of fine clothes, a couple of business trips to New York a year, maybe once in a while Europe. You wouldn't mind that, would you, George?	Would I?  You're not talking to somebody else around here, are you? You know, this is me, you remember me? George Bailey.
2 Oh, yes, George Bailey. Whose ship has just come in  providing he has brains enough to climb aboard.	Well, what about the Building and Loan?
3 Oh, confound it, man, are you afraid of success? I'm offering you a three year contract at twenty thousand dollars a year, starting today. Is it a deal or isn't it?	Well, Mr. Potter, I . . . I . . . I know I ought to jump at the chance, but I . . . I just . . . I wonder if it would be possible for you to give me twenty-four hours to think it over?
4 Sure, sure, sure. You go on home and talk about it to your wife.	I'd like to do that.
5 In the meantime, I'll draw up the papers.	All right, sir.

1 Well, hello.	Hello. You look at me as if you didn't know me.
2 Well, I don't.	You've passed me on the street almost every day.
3 Me?	Uh-huh.
4 Uh-uh. That was a little girl named Mary Hatch. That wasn't you.

1 Ouch!	Gesundheit. This requires a little thought here.

1 Where are we going?  Look at this. There's the kitty, Ernie. Here, come on, count it, Mary.	I feel like a bootlegger's wife.  Look!
2 You know what we're going to do? We're going to shoot the works. A whole week in New York. A whole week in Bermuda. The highest hotels  the oldest champagne  the richest caviar  the hottest music, and the prettiest wife!

1 Mary! Mary!	George, darling! Where have you been?

1 For me...?	What the hell.  For you....

1 Bring her to port a little.  That's it -- steady.	I think we're changing course a little.

1 Your dad must be really pissed.	We better go back in.
2 It's not going to be easy.

1 But we had it!  We were headed right for it!	Shit.  Shit, shit, shit!

1 You coming up on him?	You bet.  Hang on....

1 I never heard of a 908.	I just made it up.  It means, "Get me out of there."  What the hell's that?
2 Diver's camera.  Tom Andrews brought it up from under that abandoned cruiser.	Abandoned?  It's a little early in the season for that.
3 Rich people.  Home port is Newport, Rhode Island.	If I had a $100,000 boat, I sure as hell wouldn't leave it anchored alone in the channel.
4 If you had a $100,000 boat there'd be an investigation.

1 Untie that rope.	Please.  It's my job.

1 Pop....	You stay right here.  You're going in with me.

1 Fantastic lady.  Don't know what I'd do without her.	Me neither.
2 Y'know, Brody -- for the first time in years it's worth putting money into this town.	All of us thank you, okay?

1 Length, 22 feet, 8 inches.	Come on, let's check the bite radius.
2 The what?	Bite radius.  You know, the size of the mouth?
3 The whale's mouth?	The Shark's mouth.
4 What shark?

1 Let's get the kid home.	Home it is.

1 Thank you.  I'll tell him.	For me?
2 Sort of -- Mathew Hooper is aboard the research vessel Aurora, presently in the Antarctic Ocean, and won't be in radio range until half-past next spring.	Damn.

1 What're you doing?	Going out.

1 Affirmative.  Can you get your chopper airborne?	10-4, in a few minutes.  He's down checking a buoy in the Bay Channel.
2 Get him the hell over to Amity Point, the old lighthouse.  Right now.	What for?
3 There's a bunch of Kids day-sailing that way.  Turn them back to port.	That's it?
4 That's it.  Just do it, all right?	10-4,   soon as I can raise him.
5 If they're not at the light, look for them.  I don't want them out there.  Get them back to port!	Affirmative, affirmative.  Turn the Kids day-sailing back to port.  I heard you.  Patrol out.

1 Is that me?	That's you.
2 I've never been supercargo.

1 Mike!  Are you going out?	Maybe.

1 The wind drift is lateral.	What's that mean?
2 Sideways -  For every yard we go this way, we also slide sideways this way....

1 Be careful....	Anything?

1 I thought you were grounded.	I can go out if I want to.

1 They're turning around.	Coming about, then.

1 Oh, my God....	What the hell is he doing?

1 I don't understand.  Overman's too good a diver to disappear.	Have you checked the bars?  The guy's irresponsible;  he's done this before.

1 Damn it.  I can't understand!  I gotta go, hon.	Don't forget you have your brother.
2 Yeah.	See you later.

1 What's wrong?	Nothing.

1 Kathryn...	Yes?

1 Calvin wants me to move the White for tomorrow.	... He ought to put him in here.
2 It's too soon to move him.	So tell Calvin.
3 I did.  He wants it on exhibit.	Well, that's why you got it.

1 Michael, you don't have to go down there.	I want that shark, Kathryn.
2 You don't have to prove anything.	Only to myself.

1 Lunch for Whitey.  Something to munch on in case things get dicey.	We're taking that shark alive!
2 Let's hope he knows that.	I know it and I will not go down into this lagoon as long as you carry that!
3 Why?	Because I don't trust you, that's why.

1 He's big as a bloody bus!	The water ski show!  We have to get them out!

1 Kelly, could you look after Sean for a while?  Show him around for me?	Sure.  No problem.
2 Thanks.

1 Sean, do you have herpes?	No.  Of course not.  Don't listen to him.  He's - he's...  ... my brother.

1 Ahhh, ahhh...	Now what?
2 Gotta sneeze.	Don't you dare.
3 Can't help it... ahh...

1 Filter system number four.  Is it large enough?	It's large enough...

1 Took it this morning.	He needs a haircut.
2 Yeah, right.

1 Thea....	Sometimes my father puts me in his lap and lets me steer the Jeep.
2 Don't bother Hoagie....

1 Where are you going?	Nowhere....

1 I take out the garbage, because...I'm glad we got that straightened out....	We don't have anything straightened out.  You're uptight about something ...what's wrong?
2 Why should there be anything wrong? I'm sitting around the house, enjoying my day off and you start yelling at me about garbage....

1 It'll grow on you.	I like it.  Really....

1 Sweet breezes...Sweet women....	You have something to say about everything....

1 The fish.  Check it....	You check it....
2 I'm on the phone....

1 Your father was six then.  Just like you....	I'm still five....

1 Sit down, Ma....	You guys must be starving....

1 I'll be all right, Michael.	Good.  So will I....

1 You looked just like your father... The first time the shark came to Amity....	I don't want to talk about that.
2 It's a terrible thing to know some- thing no one else wants to believe.	I'm tired of hearing about it. There's no shark.  Sean wasn't killed by the same shark.. Dad didn't die because of it...It's all wrong... Some fantasy you've concocted...You keep bringing it up.

1 Sometimes I think I'm going crazy. The nightmares....	It could have been an accident....
2 It was no accident....	I'm not saying you're wrong, just that there are other possibilities....
3 When it killed Sean it was like a stab in the heart.  I knew with absolute certainty that it had come for him. I knew that.  I know it's coming....

1 A drink with an umbrella in it....	A big one....
2 A big one....

1 I tried to tell you...I tried....	Give me a hand here for Christ's sake....

1 I hope she's a good sailor....	A shark attacked Thea and some kids...She's going after it....

1 Mind if I cut in?  Your date's lonely....	The world would be a better place if more sons danced with their mothers.

1 She has good days and bad...I don't know....	She's a tough lady....
2 I wish there was something I could do....	She's had a lot to deal with...She needs time....
3 Would you talk to her?  She's got it in her head that the shark came for him.  She still blames it for my father's death....	Oh, boy....

1 Sharp shirt, Jake....	May your sex life be as busy as your shirt....

1 What for?  We've got a job to finish ...Why are you making the monitor?	As the sun slowly sets in the West, we bid a fond farewell to the family of conch....

1 Bring her about.  We're headed in the wrong direction....	Half the pilots down here fly drugs ...He's always going off....
2 Half don't...Bring her about....	I am...You must know something about him....
3 He gambles...He likes a good time...I see him around....	I hear he flies a lot of private charters....

1 What the hell are you doing?	I've got to get to her....
2 You jump, you'll kill yourself....

1 She's in management....	I'm training to....
2 Manage the whole damn place some day. I'm looking forward to living in the style to which I would like to become accustomed....	I'd have to manage a nookie parlor to do that....

1 I dunno .. Guess the dozer musta shifted him? You need some hands up here to look ..	You heard. Look for the knife.

1 Not today .. I'm on a diet to- day .. I'll take a diet soda ..	Since when did you drink diet soda?

1 Why don't you dump it? Mail it off. Give the fucking F.B.I. a present?	Why don't you dump the "Fat Lady?"
2 Because I dislike her too much ..	O.K. and I'm not in love with this fukker? That's how I feel about him.
3 No you don't. That's how you <u>think</u> you feel about him. That's how you feel about <u>yourself</u>. You won't give yourself one-fucking-minute for <u>you</u>.

1 You believe me, don't you?	What does it matter what I bel- ieve? .. What you gotta worry about is what Citrine believes ..

1 That's a very stupid question, Ross.	I'm asking it.
2 How the hell do I know <u>who</u>? Some jerk-off. Some peeping-tom prick.

1 Bull shit .. I'm in my prime ..	Bits.
2 What d'you mean, "bits."

1 What do you want me to do, Chief?	I'm not telling you what to do. What I will say, is <u>right</u> <u>now</u>, that child's tricycle there is more important to me than this ..

1 Did he get you the job?	I think he would have if he could have - been trying to get me up here long enough - I think he may have bribed the old guy to retire ..
2 Popeye wasn't old. Younger than you.

1 As recent as we have .. What ex- actly is your interest in Amber?	I'm afraid I can't give you an ans- wer to that, Mr Goodridge. As I ex- plained to your secretary, we're do- ing a lotta looking, but we're not even sure it's her we're lookin for ..
2 Then what are you hoping I'm gon- na do? Dissuade, or persuade you?	I was hopin since we spoke that you might have remembered something that would give us an idea where she is?
3 Then you could have saved yourself a lot of driving, Sergeant. What I said on the phone's the same as I'm saying now. I got no idea where Amb- er is, or who it was took her there.

1 Have you been here long?	No, just a minute or two .. I knocked on your door - no one home, so I followed the music ..
2 I'm sorry. I'll get my things.	No problem. I'm not in a hurry.

1 I know what you're like ..	How d'you know what I'm like?
2 Ross told me.	Really? What did he say?
3 He said you're quite chubby. And you have a nervous tick.	He said that? What else did he say?
4 Just your age.	Which is what?
5 Fifty-seven .. I don't mind ..

1 I think they're gonna arrest me.	I don't want them to arrest you.
2 It's not as bad as it sounds .. They can't refuse me bail. Raise bail of my own cognizance & find the best damned lawyer there is ..

1 How you doing on those shoes?	Don't mix very well with beer.

1 She married some English prick.	He's not that bad of a guy ..?
2 Got a handshake like a partially excited penis.

1 I think I found some- thing horrible, Sir	Whatta you mean, "horrible?"
2 I think I've found a hand.

1 I know.  Sorry I threw a scare into our lives there --	Don't worry about it -- I never told you what I thought of that memo either --
2 Well, no you didn't --	You lost your head, it happens.  I'm so fuckin jazzed!  Listen. I'm going to have to fly to Chicago tomorrow, how 'bout if we meet in the Dallas airport and we all fly into New York together for the draft?
3 It's a plan --  -- _ 51.

1 I did the 23 hour nose-route to the top of El Capitan in 6 hours! I can make this work.	No.

1 Look, Rod, just get on the camel!	Bill, Rod, wait --

1 And I guess we didn't talk about money.  So, I'll just dive in --	Give me your number.  I'll call tomorrow.  I'm just a little. I'm a little insane right now.  But it's going to be great.
2 No no, I know --

1 Hey you.	Hi.

1 I'm working with you because of that memo...	Mission... statement...

1 Yeah.  It wasn't like my marriage to Roger was so great, even before --  Jerry?	What?
2 Let's not tell our sad stories.

1 Why do you love me?	Why do you love me?

1 He just lost his best client.  He called from the plane.  I invited the guy over.	Dotty -- this is not "guy.". This is a "syndrome."  It's called Early Midlife, About-To-Marry, Hanging Onto The-Bottom-Rung Dear- God-Don't-Let-Me-Be-Alone, I'll- Call-My-Newly Long-suffering- Assistant-Without Medical-For- Company Syndrome.  And if, knowing all that, you still allow him to come over, more power to you.
2 Honey, he's engaged.  And for the first time in my professional life, I'm a part of something I believe in.

1 Oh yes.  Jerry Maguire!  My agent! This is a fierce, loving individual, I love this man, he is love, he is about love -- my ambassador of kwan.	Ten seconds, Rod.
2 And I love my fans, of which he is one. Wanna thank them for all my Sundays, and of course my Monday nights too.  That about says it...

1 Good, 'cause see, I am a valuable commodity.  I go across the middle. I see the ball and a dude coming right at me, wanting to kill me, I tell my brain "get killed, catch the ball." That's New York Steak, baby.  Rare. And yet, nobody's giving me LOVE. Nobody's giving me PROPS.  Nobody. I went to Arizona State, I'm from Arizona, I break Arizona records, I'm a Sun Devil, man!!!	Now you want Arizona dollars.
2 Exactly.  And I'm sitting here with an ant problem, look!  And my brother Tee Pee's room is flooded with water.  Say hello to Jerry Maguire --

1 Rod --	You feel bad you tested positive? Quit doing blow!  You feel bad about your baby girl? Why did you leave the mother?
2 What are you doing with me, Rod?	Huh?
3 Don't you even see -- I'm finished. I'm fucked. Twenty-four hours ago, I was hot. Now... I'm a cautionary tale!

1 Do your job, man, don't tell me to dance.	Fine.

1 You never had The Talk, did you?	No.
2 Well, this was another way to go.

1 I have to ask.	What --
2 Where'd you find the perfect white shirt?

1 Marcee, things are changing around here.  You and Rod will have my total personal attention.	Damn right, and you can start by taking Rod's poster and putting it where people can see it!
2 Damn right.

1 Aw shit...the crowded restaurant... so there's no scene...	I know.  It sucks.  I suck.

1 I won't tell.	We'll go to the zoo sometime. Okay? I think I might have some time on my hands.

1 After what you've seen today, you really think your son could be alive?	He's smart, Dr. Grant. And he knows so much about dinosaurs.

1 We can't just...	Don't worry, honey. We'll circle around and come back.

1 Udesky.	He's this way.

1 My own kid was right in front of me and I didn't do a damn thing.	You couldn't have made that jump.
2 I should have tried. It should have been me on that beach back there, not Billy.	How would you have helped Eric?  He needs you, Paul. He needs us.
3 He could have died.	But he didn't. And neither did you. And I'm glad about that.

1 Where's Dad?	Just hold on.

1 You rented an automated litter box.	It's a rapid prototyper. I feed in the scan data from the raptor skull, than the computer breaks it into thousands of slices which this thing prints, one layer on top of the other. It's the future of paleontology.
2 Not if it can't dig.

1 We need to keep moving.	Alan, I want to tell you that I'm so sorry about the...
2 Billy, I can't talk to you now.

1 When I met you, I thought that one day millions of years ago, all the dinosaurs became extinct. Wiped out. But you told me otherwise. When conditions changed, dinosaurs changed. They became other things. They evolved.	A well-accepted theory.
2 Alan don't be afraid to evolve.

1 We climb down to the barge and follow the river out to the ocean. With any luck, the Costa Rican coast guard will pick us up.	Then we go home?

1 Hmmm.	Now, for our wedding anniversary this year we wanted to do something really special, something...

1 Billy!	It's no use, Dr. Grant. No use.

1 Is there an antidote?	Like if you shoot yourself in the foot?  Wouldn't matter.  You'd be dead  before you realized you'd accidentally pulled the trigger.

1 But he's the head of InGen!	You gotta be kidding.  You dragged me out of Greenpeace to be a corporate stooge?  You couldn't get anybody else?

1 How could you possibly?	Because you said so.  Maybe nobody else believed you, but I always did.

1 You rally think this'll draw the parent?	I once saw a bull elephant die charging a jeep.  All the jeep had done was startle the bull's calves. I saw a lioness carry wounded prey four and a half miles, all the way back to its den, just to teach its cubs how to finish off a kill.
2 Killing lessons?  Heartwarming.	Rex won't be any different.  It'll come.
3 You're kidding yourself.  An adult T-rex cares about one thing -- filling its own belly.  It acts the way people wish they could, that's why everyone's fascinated by it.  If people had the chance to see one dinosaur and one only, ninety-nine percent would --

1 It's... behind... us.	It's just fed.  It won't attack unless it's threatened.  Don't move.

1 Do you see any family resemblance here?	You can't stay, Kelly, that's it. It's too dangerous.

1 Something's wrong.	Look!  Sarah!

1 No!  We're an independently funded expedition.	Funded by whom?
2 John Hammond.

1 -- way we could safely --	Oh, no!

1 If we can't stay in the rex's territory, we have to move tonight.	Move where?  Our boat's not coming for two days, your airlift is waiting for an order you have no way to send --

1 Woah, woah, woah, what the hell, what the hell?	What now?
2 Fences are failing, all over the park!  A few minor systems, he said!	Find Nedry!  Check the vending machines!
3 The monitors are failing.

1 Oh, I'll get 'em all.	Remember - - viable embryos.  They're no use to us if they don't survive.
2 How am I supposed to transport them?

1 Sure.  I've got a gas powered jeep.  I can drop her at the visitor's center before I make the boat with the others.	I'll catch up with you.  You can go with the others.

1 This is just a delay, that's all this is.  All major theme parks have had delays.  When they opened Disneyland in 1956, nothing worked, nothing.	John....

1 The movement!	The - - agility.  You're right!

1 Elm that's it, it explains the periodicity, the - -	- - the undigested state of the berries because it's - -
2 - - totally incidental  unrelated to the feeding pattern - -

1 Alan?!	They're not here.

1 No.	No?  Non-linear equations?  Strange attractions?  Dr. Sattler, I refuse to believe that you are not familiar with the concept of attraction!

1 Yes?	- - shut up.
2 Yes.  It's not a criticism, by the way.

1 John, we - - what I'm just saying....	Relax Donald, relax.  They're scientists.  They ought to be curious.

1 I threw up.	That's okay.  Listen, give me your hand.

1 I can't!  I'm scared!	Tim, you're gonna have to let go.  I'm going to count to three.

1 Their radio's out too.  Gennaro said to stay put.	The kids okay?
2 Well, I didn't ask.  Why wouldn't they be?	Kids get scared.
3 What's to be scared about?  It's just a little hiccup in the power.	I didn't say I was scared.
4 I didn't say you were scared.	I know.
5 Fine.

1 Blood temperature feels like high eighties.	Wu?

1 It's safe?	It's safe.
2 It's safe.	Go  that's the way we're going to go.  What do you say?
3 Alright.

1 C'mon Tim, move down, damn it!	Timmy!  The power is coming down, quick!

1 You don't give us our due credit.  Our scientists have done things no one could ever do before.	Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they didn't stop to think if they should.  Science can create pesticides, but it can't tell us not to use them.  Science can make a nuclear reactor, but it can't tell us not to build it!
2 But this is nature!  Why not give an extinct species a second chance?!  I mean, Condors. Condors are on the verge of extinction - - if I'd created a flock of them on the island, you wouldn't be saying any of this!  have anything to say at all!	Hold on - - this is no species that was obliterated by deforestation or the building of a dam.  Dinosaurs had their shot.  Nature selected them for extinction.
3 I don't understand this Luddite attitude, especially from a scientist.  How could we stand in the light of discovery and not act?	There's nothing that great about discovery.  What's so great about discovery?  It's a violent, penetrative act that scars what it explores.  What you call discovery I call the rape of the natural world!

1 I'm sorry - - I'm sorry - -	Turn it off, Lex!  Turn it off!

1 Hello?	Ken, it's Bruce. Listen, we've got a nibble on the Pendleton financing.
2 Really? How much?

1 Structure might be salvageable... let's see what the interior looks like.	Mister Biller... now that we can see the lake, I think we should follow the shoreline to --
2 Help me with this.

1 I can't wait to hear your opening argument. "Ladies and Gentlemen of the Jury... the Defense will prove that Jason Voorhees did not kill all of these people. They, in fact, committed mass suicide and then buried themselves in his back yard..."	Fuck you.

1 Sorry.	It's all right.  Now... we're going to need a really good head-doctor for this. Someone who can get up on the stand and tell the jury that our client is mentally insane and has been for years...  We'll go through a dozen doctors before we find one who's willing to testify for us.

1 I don't believe it. Jason's mother died of ovarian cancer in 1969.	So?
2 I thought she was a killer, too. You know... that she chopped up a bunch of teenage camp counselors... before she was decapitated.

1 Krueger... doesn't ring a bell.	He was a child killer in the late sixties... in a town called Springwood about eight miles from here.  Guess what his murder weapon was? A glove with six-inch blades.
2 Fascinating.	Now.... according to the file, Krueger was burned to death in a fire in 1968. But get this -- beginning in 1984, there was _another_ series of murders in Springwood. All teenagers... all killed in their sleep... all killed with finger blades just like Krueger's.

1 If I'm right, this happened before the Krueger murders in Springwood.  That means that Jason might've been Krueger's first victim.	Except this victim got away. I wonder if --

1 Where do you live?	Up there.

1 I've read your stories.  They're fantastic.	I don't know what you could have read.
2 Just what you've published.	-- In magazines nobody reads.
3 I read the one about the penal colony.	Did you?
4 The needles inscribing the judgement into the flesh of the man.  Very good.

1 The keeper of the files is still waiting for your final summation of the Erlanger claim.	I gave it to him yesterday.
2 You didn't give it to <u>me</u>.	No, I left it in his office.
3 Did you see him?	I've never seen him.  I don't believe there is a keeper of the files.
4 He's usually in the storage room sorting things out.  He can't close the file on a case until he has the concluding report.	He has it, he just hasn't noticed it yet, all right?
5 Who's to say he ever will?  He's a timid old man and quite careful not to tread on anyone's toes -- In fact, I'm the only one he trusts and he wouldn't even look at a document if it didn't first come through me.

1 I'm Kafka -- I work upstairs in Accident --	I know.
2 You're a friend of Eduard Raban's.	Why would you suppose so?
3 Oh -- well, I thought he once mentioned --	One of you must be mistaken.

1 -- I don't know the Musil district.	You won't have any trouble finding it.

1 Of course he is -- the Castle precincts are not the safest part of the city after dark.  People disappear up there regularly.   If you want to lie in wait for someone, that's the place to do it.	Now you're saying Eduard was lured there?
2 How often does one of our clerks have business in the house of records?	I've heard of it happening.
3 And Burgel is the bringer of messages, isn't he?	Usually.

1 You told me to contact you if anything relevant came up -- Gabriela is relevant.  When I spoke to you before I didn't know she'd been seeing Eduard.	That's been noted.  But where does it lead us?  Unless you have something more to add.
2 She's missing.  I went to her house and she hadn't returned there.

1 That's <u>mad</u>.	-- Oh, yes, it's mad.

1 The fact that it's live bodies you practice your trade on doesn't seem to matter to you.	On the contrary, it matters a great deal.  We're engaged in immensely important research here.  I'm a revolutionary too, you know -- but a much more pragmatic one.

1 Women are all you have on your mind!	She went to the roof to sunbathe one lunch hour -- we watched her changing.

1 I'm coming onboard! Throw down a ladder!	You're outta your depth here, Miss Darrow!
2 There's no hard feelings, Mr Denham! I just want to come to the island with you!	Does this look like the "Queen Mary"?? We don't take passengers! Full steam ahead, Captain Engelhorn!

1 Father It's somewhere south-west of here - we need to inform the museum ...  organize an expedition -	All in due course, Ann. Our first responsibility is to get these artifacts safely back to London.

1 There's a light up ahead.	Sun's coming up ...  We've been in the fog for six hours.

1 I guess that answers your questions. There's no island on these co- ordinates - not even a lousy fog-bank.	Well, that was a monumental waste of time! I pay good money, only to be taken on some wild goose chase!  I made the mistake of trusting my idiot translator!

1 Holy shit! Look at the size of that!	That's your monkey, Denham.
2 Kong ...

1 It must have been terrifying?	Yeah.

1 All right. Loneliness.  Well -- separated. From other people. Forgotten.  Well, as if I can be here, I can go through the motions, right? But the truth is, I don't belong.	Don't belong?
2 Do you always have to repeat?	Sorry. 
3 Well it's more than loneliness. Hate. People hating me -- and watching me and following and waiting to hurt me -- you know? I'm all screwed up.	You think people hate you.
4 The truth is I hate them: they must hate me. All right, the money.  All right, not the money. A kind of put-on. It gets things back together.  Well let's say I'd go to one of these cattle-calls, a tryout. I mean before -- before I got this job -- and they'd always say thank you very much and i'd feel, you know, brought down. They didn't want me.	Didn't want you.
5 I said that.  Well, so you have a choice. You can either feel lonely -- you know, the hate -- or --  So you take a call and go to a hotel room and there's some John you've never seen before, but he wants you. He must, he's paying for it.  And usually they're nervous and that's all right, too, because you're not; you know this thing. And then for a while, boy, they really pay attention, you're all there is.  And it's not real and you don't have to even like them -- you can even hate them, it's all right, it safe -- you know?

1 What about?	My name's John Klute.
2 You said that.	I'm an investigator. I'd like to ask you some questions about Tom Grunemann.

1 I have some names the police gave me. Frank Ligourin. Will you tell me what --	Look, I'm sure this'll amuse you too. Ilia trying to get away from all that.
2 What about the old gentleman the other night, Mr. Faber?

1 I thought you were going back to the apartment.	You said you wanted these.

1 The next few weeks I would like to know where you are all the time.	Why?
2 Just let me know when you are going out and where --	What if i go out on tricks - you wanna come along? You could sit and read the National Geographic.
3 How can you do it to yourself?	I don't get you.
4 Ligourin: How could you do it?	I told you before, you wouldn't understand.
5 You're right, I don't understand. Explain it to me.  You were scared. Arlyn Page, that scared you. Well it should; that's death. So what did you do, you ran straight for it, death. Ligourin kills women.	No.
6 No, no you're right, I'm sorry. He uses women; he lets them kill themselves. Is that how you want it?	Arlyn was a junkie; I'm not on junk!
7 No, you can find some other way.  Explain it to me. Bree, show me any sense to --	You get the Christ out! You dumb stupid bastard, you don't know anything, you square, you get out! I don't have to show you anything; you get out!

1 Ah, Schmendrick -- what's the scam?	Those were police laboratory people, they've been over the apartment.
2 Oh zippidy-doo, they'll find my fingerprints.  Can I go in? I need some stuff.

1 She wouldn't be reliable anyhow -- a narcotics addict.	I believed her, Pete.

1 I've always respected Bree.  I'd like to make something clear.	I've just got a few --
2 I'd like to make something clear. I don't go after a girl; a girl comes to me. Her choice. Right?

1 Well?	Yeah.

1 Where is the child?	He's in his room, playing.
2 Good.  I'll see him in there.

1 When is mommy coming back?	Soon.  Very soon.

1 Mom, I mean dad...	Uh huh...
2 That's not the right soap.  We use the kind in the green and yellow box.	C'mon, there's not much difference--
3 We use the green and yellow.

1 I want my...mm...ommy...I want mmmy...mommy...	Tough shit.  You're stuck with me.

1 Objection.  You're leading the witness.	Sure.

1 Billy, sometimes when a mother and a father are divorced, there's a discussion about who the child should live with, the mother or the father.  Now there is a man who is very wise.  He's called a judge.  And a judge has a lot of experience with divorces and he decides who it would be best for the child to live with.	Why does he decide?
2 Because...Well, that's what he does.  He's a very powerful man.	Like a principal?
3 Bigger than a principal.  The judge sits in robes in a big chair.. The judge has thought a lot about us, about you and me and your mom, and he has decided...  ...he has decided that it would be best for you to live with your mom Joanna in her apartment.  And I'm very lucky.  Because even though you'll live with your mom Joanna I'll get to see you once a week for dinner and a couple of weekends a month.	I don't understand, daddy.
4 What don't you understand, pal?	Where will my bed be, where will I sleep?
5 At your mom's.  She'll have a bed for you in your own room.	Where will my toys be?
6 I'll send your toys there and I'm sure you'll get some new ones.	Who will read me my stories?
7 Your mom.	Daddy, what if The Face comes when I'm at mommy's?
8 Your mom knows all about The Face, okay?  Don't worry, she'll tell The Face to beat it.	Will you come and say good-night to me every night?

1 Objection.	How long do you plan to live in New York, Mrs. Kramer?

1 Ted was a good worker.  But, ah... ... after his wife left him and he was taking care of the kid on his own, things started to change. Look, I know he had problems, I understand that.  I've got problems, everybody's got problems.  But I've got a shop to run, I can't let that kind of thing get in the way...  I guess I felt that Ted was letting his duties at home interfere with his responsibilities in the office.	Thank you.  I have no further questions.

1 I thought you might just like to know that at five-fifteen this afternoon we were officially handed the Fire and Ice account by Revlon.	Ted, I'm leaving you.
2 That represents a gross billing in excess of two million--  What?!

1 He looks like a terrific kid.	He is...  You sat in that coffee shop across from school--
2 Watching my son...Ted, I've been living in New York for the past two months.	You've been living here, in the city?
3 Ted...The reason I wanted to see you...I want Billy back.	You want what?!
4 I want my son.  I'm through sitting in coffee shops looking at him from across the street. I want my son.	Are you out of your mind?! You're the one that walked out on him, remember?
5 Ted, listen to me...You and I, we had a really crappy marriage--  Look, don't get so defensive, okay?  It was probably as much my fault as it was yours... Anyway when I left I was really screwed up--	Joanna, I don't give a--
6 Ted, all my life I'd either been somebody's daughter or somebody's wife, or somebody else's mother. Then all of a sudden, I was a thirty-two-year-old, highly neurotic woman who had just walked out on her husband and child.  I went to California because that was about as far away as I could get.  Only... I guess it wasn't far enough. So I started going to a shrink.  Ted, I've had time to think. I've been through some changes. I've learned a lot about myself.	Such as?

1 Jesus Christ.  That's a real blockbuster.  I always figured you guys had it made.	You want to know the real kicker?  The real kicker is, for the first time in my life-- the first time--I feel like a loser.

1 And?	He wanted to know if I liked fried chicken.
2 Do you?

1 Mr. O'Connor called.  There's a meeting with the Revlon people in the board room and you're fifteen minutes late.	I know....I know.
2 Mr. Schmidt can't have the figures on the television buy until Monday.	No.  Uh, uh.  Tell him I asked for it Friday.  I want it Friday. Period.
3 Mr. Lombardo from packaging wants to meet on Friday.	Fine.

1 Good Christ, Joanna, just get the hell out of my life.	Ted?  Are you there?
2 Yeah.	Any prospects?
3 Don't worry.  I plan to have something within twenty-four hours, John.	How the hell are you going to do that?
4 I don't know.

1 What are you going to do?	I don't know, Thel...This whole thing has happened so...Pow, like that.
2 I mean, what are you going to do about Billy?	I'm gonna keep him, why?
3 Look, this is nothing personal, but I don't think you can do it.	Thelma, I've lost my wife, I'm not losing my child.
4 All right...Okay...But let's get something straight, right now. I mean, I'm sorry about what happened between you and Joanna, but it's not my problem, understand?

1 Hey, that's terrific.	Maybe.  I said maybe.  What I mean is, ah...I don't think it'll really work out, but Charley seems to want it, so...

1 And that day, your father got better. He named you Lhamo. "The Protector."	I know.

1 Have you heard the terms of the Seventeen Point Agreement?	I have.
2 I have a copy for you.

1 Your Prime Ministers, support the proposal that you return to Lhasa. On the opposite hand, some officials urge you not to return. They believe you should leave now, for India.	If I were to go into exile, could we expect any serious assistance, from India, suppose?

1 You can't do anything real until you are Dalai Lama.	I am him.
2 Not until you are eighteen.

1 Quite simple. Yes. Good.	I shall send a letter to America, to the President, informing him of our problem.

1 I have always asked for plain information. Just the truth.	The Communists put their guns in the hands of the Khamba children and force the child to kill the parent. They have dropped bombs on the monastery of Lithang in Kham. It has been destroyed. Women and children, trying to escape from the fighting, have been shot with machine guns, fired from airplanes.

1 I have been greatly impressed by your accomplishments. Industrial progress. Great efficiency. Your people are capable and courteous.	You have a lot to learn about organization. How to draw out people's opinions. How to make key decisions. Train your young Tibetans. When I make contact with you, I want to reach you through a Tibetan.
2 Always.

1 I want to go down there.	You can only go with attendants and a big ceremony.
2 I want to run down the street. I want to buy a toy. Eat from the shops.	You cannot.
3 I want to be a shepherd, taking those goats and cows out to the hillside.	But you are not a shepherd, you are the Dalai Lama.
4 Maybe in the next life, the world will not need a Dalai Lama.	I would not know. Maybe.

1 You are in great danger. The Dalai Lama cannot fall into Chinese hands. You must flee.	How could I ever leave?
2 It may not be your decision to make.

1 Oh, my husband passed away almost two years ago.	My department doesn't have any record of that, Mrs. Bickerman.
2 Oh well, I'm sorry.  I didn't realize you keep such a firm track of the dead.

1 <u>Please</u>.  I'll have sex with you, anything, but get out of the water.	He's not gonna hurt <u>me</u>.

1 You listen to me.  The only reason I'm letting you be part of this is 'cause you got the helicopter and the radar--	And you like me.
2 I do <u>not</u> like you.	Deep down, gut check.  I'm growing fond of <u>you</u> and it's liberating to say so.

1 Asia?  How... how could he get here?	Obviously some asshole in Hong Kong flushed him down a toilet.

1 Let's not overlook he didn't eat me, maybe--	'Cause he just ate a cow, you stupid--

1 <u>No</u>.  Look.  He's got nothing left.	Yeah and every time we think there's no more danger--

1 <u>Jack</u>!	I'm a civilian!  You don't have any authority--

1 Kelly Scott.	Jack Wells.  A museum sent you?
2 Are we all museum bigots in Maine?

1 Baby crocs?	Adult males will charge hatchlings. If there's one out there...
2 If one could be out there... why does Fish And Game tell me it's impossible?	Because they just consult their little indigenous charts.

1 Hard to believe there could be a monster under such peacefulness.	I thought I might track the shoreline tomorrow, look for prints.

1 I'm gonna get ticks.  I know it. They're drawn to me.  I got a thing about ticks.	Ssssh!
2 What?	I heard something.

1 Watch out!!	Keep firing!

1 Different worlds, Jack.	Yeah, I thought about that as I was driving... and... I haven't found somebody in my world.  You found anyone in yours?
2 No.	So I was thinking... maybe if I met anybody in <u>my</u> world who was good for <u>you</u> and if you know somebody in New York good for me, we could fix each other up.
3 You think?	Worth a try.  We don't wanna be alone forever, do we?
4 Probably not.

1 Even if we <u>could</u> tranq him-- how would we get him on land.	Other than to eat us?

1 <u>What</u> <u>is</u> <u>that</u>?	Lightweight Forward Area air device unit.  Whatever's out there, one shot with this and he's dead.
2 And you stock these things for what, to fend off Russia?

1 Is this 'spose to make me take him more serious?	It's to make you <u>understand</u> him, with understanding comes tolerance. Too bad they don't put proverbs in Twinkies, my load would be lighter.
2 Why does everybody insult my intelligence, I have intelligence, intelligent people eat Twinkies.	I'm sorry.

1 What is she doing <u>now</u>?  <u>Mother</u> <u>of</u> <u>God</u>.	What?
2 Look ten feet into the water.

1 I was working for you when "us" started, what's--	I know and I thought I could handle it but work and pleasure along with somebody else, it's a dangerous mix.
2 Kevin, as long as we...  What was that last part?	The somebody else part?
3 Yeah, that part.  There's... somebody who's um...	Else.

1 Phone call, Clarice. It's God.	Thanks, Ardelia.

1 Jack's pretty tough on you, isn't he? Impatient...	Sometimes.
2 He's got a lot on his mind besides Buffalo Bill... His wife, Bella, is real sick. Comatose... I'm tellin' you about it now, 'cause he may never.

1 He gave us a perfectly good description, and we're on it now, so we won't be needing your little novelty act any longer - or his, either. He's under close guard at the courthouse, pending a prison transfer. The next plane, Officer.	Sir, doesn't this "William Rubin" strike you as - I don't know - kind of vague?

1 Mrs. Lippman had a son, maybe he could help you. I have his card somewhere. Do you mind stepping inside, while I looks for it?	Thanks.

1 Talk about him, Starling. Tell me what you see.	He's a white male... Serial killers tend to hunt within their own ethnic group. And he's not a drifter - he's got his own house, somewhere. Not an apartment.
2 Why?	What he does with them - takes privacy... Time, tools... He's in his 30's or 40's - he's got real physical strength, but combined with an older man's self-control. He's cautious, precise, never impulsive... This won't end in suicide, like they often do.
3 Why not?	He's got a real taste for it now. And he's getting better at his work.
4 Maybe you've got a knack for this... I guess we're about to find out.	Like I have a "knack" for Dr. Lecter?

1 I lied to Lecter. I'll need some kind of peace offering... Can I get the drawings from his cell?	Good idea. Meantime, try to get a feel for Catherine Martin. Her apartment, her friends... how he might've stalked her. I'm going to the other two clinics, Minnesota and Ohio.  Now's the hardest part, Starling. Use your anger, don't let it keep you from thinking. Just keep your eyes on Catherine. We've got less than 30 hours.
2 Mr. Crawford... can those cops down there handle Dr. Lecter?	They'll use their best men. But they better be paying attention...

1 Is that a pretty good job, FBI agent?	I think so.
2 You get to travel around and stuff? I mean, better places then this?	Sometimes you do.
3 Freddie was so happy for me when I got this job. This - toaster giveaways, and Barry Manilow on the speakers all day - she thought this was really hot shit. What did she know, big dummy...

1 I was your choice, Dr. Lecter. You chose to speak to me. Would you prefer someone else now? Or perhaps you don't think you can help us.	That is both impudent and untrue... Tell me, how did you feel when you viewed our Billy's latest effort?  Or should I say, his "next-to-latest"?
2 By the book, he's a sadist.	Life's too slippery for books, Clarice. Typhoid and swans came from the same God.  Tell me, Miss West Virginia - was she a large girl?
3 Yes.	Big through the hips. Roomy.
4 They all were.	Mmm. And what else...?
5 She had an insect deliberately inserted in her throat. That hasn't been made public yet. We don't know what is means.	Was it a butterfly?
6 A moth... How did you predict that?	I'm waiting for your offer, Clarice. Enchant me.

1 What did you do?	Got dressed without turning on the light. I went downstairs... outside...

1 Her name is Kimberly Jane Emberg, she was just ID'd. I met her on a slab in West Virginia. And sometime tomorrow, or tomorrow night, he's going to do the same thing to Catherine Martin.	That's a childish, bullying stunt, Mr. Crawford. I was a battlefield surgeon, so you can put away your picture.

1 My God, you've grown up.	We leave in the morning?!
2 Yes, miss.	I won't sleep tonight. What an adventure!  I absolutely cannot wait to return to Portman Square, having laid eyes upon the full-blooded, red men in the wild!

1 Much further?	Top of this ridge. Fort and Lake George are downhill of it.

1 Will you go back to England?	I have nothing to go back for.

1 Cora, I adore you and, when we come together, we will be the happiest couple in England...  I am certain of that. More than ever before.  I believe you must trust the judgment of others who hold your welfare so close to their hearts...	Duncan...  Duncan, I promised you an answer. You have complimented me with your persistence and patience... But the decision I've come to is I'd rather make the gravest of mistakes than surrender my own judgment.

1 I owe you gratitude or I'd call you out!	Do not let gratitude get in the way...

1 That we did. John. But the horicane  is near trapped out.	Tradin' your skins in Castleton?

1 Yes, Mr. Poe? So?	It was a war party. It means they're on the attack up and down the frontier.

1 Webb's not in Albany. He marched the 33rd to Fort Edward two days ago.	Webb's at Edward?
2 Yes, sir.	Only twelve miles away! He could be here day after tomorrow.  Find your man, sir! Captain Beams will give you the message.

1 Sergeant Major!	Sir!
2 Thank you, Sergeant Major. Thank the men.	Atten-hut!

1 Is the hatchet buried between the English and my French father?	Yes.
2 Not a warrior has a scalp and the white men become friends.	My master owns these lands and your father has been ordered to drive off the English squatters. They have consented to go. So now he calls them enemies no longer.
3 Magua took the hatchet to color it with blood.  It is still bright. Only when it is red, then it will be buried.	But so many suns have set since Le Renard struck the war post. Is he not tired?
4 Where is that sun?! It has gone behind the hill.  It is dark and cold. It has set on his people, they are fooled and kill all the animals and sell all of their lands to enrich the European masters who are always greedy for more than they need.  And Le Subtil is the son of his tribe. There have been many clouds and many mountains. But now he has come to lead his nation.	That Le Renard has the power to lead his people into the light, I know well.

1 What do you want me to say? That it all sounds mysterious?	These observers were doing something. A test...I think they sank that ship on purpose to cover up their mistakes.
2 What mistakes?  Look, I think it's no big deal but if you want to find out why this ship sank have Maritime run a check.

1 Doc eat already?	The good doctor hasn't showed yet.

1 I hit it.  But I can't see it!  Can you see it?!	No.

1 That was a loud one wasn't it?	After a month of it you'd think I'd be used to it.

1 We made it!	Where's Jones?

1 I'm going inside.	What's your air reading?
2 Twenty minutes...	Twenty minutes!...Who had tank duty?

1 Well, according to Maritime law, you, as commander of the Shack have the authority to dispose of the body.  However, the company doesn't want you to do that.	What you don't understand is that my crew is in jeopardy.
2 But you don't have any proof at this point to assume that this disease is contagious, do you?	I'm not anxious to find out, either.
3 Beck, trust me.  If the company felt that you or your crew were in any danger we would authorize an immediate emergency pickup. We could be there in a few hours.	Do it.
4 Unfortunately.  We can't.

1 Who else...Sixpack.	The man is unbelievable... I say, leave him in there.
2 What about his suit?  That's a million five the company's got to replace.  They'll make somebody go get it.

1 So that's all you do?...	Shhhh...don't tell no one.  Job security.

1 You guys are crazy.  What the hell you play that stupid game for?	What game, Cobb?...I'm on my way to Nirvana...
2 You're on your way somewhere all right...the looney bin.	I'm on the way to the looney bin?  Hey, man, I'm not the dude sun bathing in his clothes.

1 Look.  Water.	Probably the plumbing.  You gonna make me finish that puzzle by myself, or what?

1 What is it?	"Debbie Does Dallas"...  Hell, it's in Russian.  I can't read it...

1 Don't spend all day down there.	Don't fuckin' worry, I ain't.

1 How much did you part with?	Seven hundred for the pair.

1 Because it's cheap like a budgie.	And nobody wants to live next door to the people that we live next to; a bit anti-social, you know.

1 The traffic warden went to the morgue and recognized Dog and his lot so that put us sort of in the clear. They got no case against us because there is no evidence against us.	Apart from those shotguns.
2 And Tom took care of them.

1 Er, very nice Harry. What's it for?	Don't play innocent with me Bazza; spanking!

1 Hello, John. Nice holiday?	I won't be seeing you again Chris; I have paid him every last penny.
2 I am sure you have, no one was accusing you of being dishonest, John.

1 Who was that?	That was Hatchet Horrible Harry.
2 Jesus, I have heard about him.	We're in the spite. They were his fucking guns that we sold; we gotta find 'em.

1 What the fuck did you do to Fauntleroy?	I didn't touch him, he just passed out.

1 Invitations.	Invitations?
2 Yeah invitations, you know a pretty white piece of paper with your name on it.	Well we have got about a hundred thousand pretty pieces of paper with the Queen on it. Will that do?
3 All right, just you; the others can wait in Samoan Jo's next door.	Samoan Jo's? Yon mean the pub? Hold on . . .
4 Hold on bollocks, no one but card players in here tonight sonny, and I do mean no one.

1 Well, what's going on?	I don't know, but what I do know is that there's no more Harry, which means there's no more debt, and if there's no more debt there's no more problem, and there's no more problem with our neighbours because they are all dead. I think, if I get this right, we haven't done anything wrong anyway, which means we are in the clear.

1 You and me, Tom.	What do you mean, me?

1 I'll see ya.	For half a million?
2 Unless you are going to accept twenty quid.	And still got a sense of humour. That's not monkey nuts son; you can still fold.  OK, before I loan you this, I expect, if you lose of course, my money back within a week, Crystal? That's Sunday, OK?

1 Jesus, if I pick them up, will they stay in one piece? Where did you get them from?	I got contacts. Listen Tom, if you pointed them at me I'd shit myself or do whatever you said to do. Either way you still get the desired effect.
2 They look nice, I agree . . . but lacking in criminal credibility, aren't they? I might get laughed at. How much do you want for these muskets?	Seven hundred each.

1 What's left over?'	Hold on, give us half a chance to count it.
2 What about all the gear?

1 If you had your way I wouldn't have any friends.	Oh, come on, Amado--
2 Just 'cause I'm not like Little Miss Honor Roll here--	Leave your sister out of it.
3 You and all of the teachers in this dump--your story's over, so you don't want anybody else to have fun.

1 It's not our job to get involved in your personal life, but when it interferes with the training here--	I'm sorry, Sergeant Major. There wasn't anything I could do. Shadow gets crazy--

1 You uhm--you remember what old Buddy carried for a side arm?	Colt Peacemaker.
2 A .45--	He swore by it.  What?
3 Just wondering.	So is Buddy on your short list?
4 If it was some poor mojado, swam across at night, got lost in the scrub and starved out there, we wouldn't go any further. But this is a formerly prominent citizen.	You got to investigate. No question about it.
5 What I will do is keep names out of it till we got some answers or hit a dead end. You know how the press is with a murder story--even if it's forty years old.	Yeah, it's a pretty cold trail.

1 You've been in this house for a while?	I been here with him eight years now. He built it when he was with Leora.
2 I never met her.	There was a bunch of 'em You never met. Me neither.

1 Dad, I talked to the track coach--	I thought we already had this out? Next year, if your grades are high enough--
2 I have a B average.	How many B-average students do you think they take at West Point?

1 The Sheriff says we shouldn't touch anything,	He can't hear with that rig on-- Mikey!

1 Treasure hunter?	Old bullets.  He uhm-- makes art with them.

1 So.	So tell me why I shouldn't make this place off-limits.
2 This is an official visit, then--	I assume a lot of your business is from our people.

1 Como se llama? [What's your name?]	Mercedes Gonzales Ruiz.
2 Me llama Eladio Cruz--Bienvenido a Tejas. [Welcome to Texas.]

1 Big day coming up--I wish we'd have thought of it while he was still living. But he went so unexpected.	Better late than never. Korean War hero, Sheriff for near thirty years-- Buddy Deeds Memorial P--

1 Which is why we need to talk to you about the new jail--just so we're all on the same page.	We don't need a new jail.
2 That's a matter of interpretation--	We're already renting cells to the Feds for their overflow--

1 You don't remember anything else from that last night you saw him, do you?	I told the story enough times--hell, we were just in the car, he was stewing about the fight with Buddy while we drove over to Roderick Bledsoe's--
2 Bledso	He owned the colored roadhouse before Big O--
3 He still living?	No. I think his widow's still in their place in Darktown, though.  You think it's Charley Wade, huh?
4 Forensics people are sure of it. You have any idea who might have put him there?

1 There was a mandate in the last election--	It wouldn't happen to be your construction company gonna get the bid on building this thing, would it, H.L. And Jorge, you wouldn't be thinking about a couple dozen new jobs to dangle in front of the voters--

1 Oh--I think he came in one more time with Hollis and--naw, your Daddy wasn't with them. Made their monthly pickup. Roderick wasn't in so I just kept my mouth good and shut and handed over that envelope.	That was the night he disappeared?
2 Could of been. That was white people's business.	And when my father was Sheriff?
3 What about it?	What was your deal with him?

1 That's how I ruined my stomach.	I'm surprised he bothered with it.
2 He was afraid I was going to poison somebody. Your father tried to do good for people--	So I've heard--
3 And your mother was a saint. That summer I built the patio at your house? She made me lunch every day.	Well, you were working there--
4 It could have just been a box lunch from the jail.

1 So why did you come back here, Sam?	Got divorced, I wasn't gonna work for my father-in-law anymore. The fellas down here said they'd back me--
2 You don't want to be Sheriff.	I got to admit it's not what I thought it'd be. Back When Buddy had it-- hell, I'm just a jailer. Run a 60- room hotel with bars on the windows.
3 It can happen so sudden, can't it? Being left out on your own.	You've got your mother, your kids--
4 They've got me. Different thing.

1 We start from scratch--	Yeah--
2 Everything that went before, all that stuff, that history--the hell with it, right?

1 Hey Sam. Sorry 'bout that.	What's up?
2 We had about a dozen wets come over just upriver. They ran into one of our posts--it was like a breakshot on a pool table, illegals runnin' every which way.	I haven't seen anybody come by.
3 We'll get 'em--  So you livin' out here now?	Yeah. It's quiet--
4 I heard about that deal for your father--You must be real proud.	Sure.
5 The stories people tell, he was a real colorful fella--

1 Yeah?	You haven't paid the cab.  He won't give us your bags 'til you pay him.
2 How much?	Thirty-five bucks.
3 Tell him he can keep them. The Bellboy looks puzzled.

1 Hokey enough for you?	I'm out of here, man!  Are you coming?

1 I don't want him getting in the way.	He won't.

1 He's with us...	He's with us... He's with us...

1 I didn't marry him for love, Mr. D'Amour.  Tonight?	Sure.

1 So Swann was performing magic. not illusions?  And what?  You thought he should be using it to cure cancer, not making millions.	I told you --
2 Too much fame.  Yeah, I guess that'd turn anybody's head. Including yours.	No.
3 You said you weren't with him for love.	I wasn't.
4 What then?	I was grateful to him.  I owed him my life.  And he loved me. He couldn't always show it, but he felt it.
5 He thought Nix was coming back, didn't he?

1 No!  No!  No!	Harry...

1 Bad show last night?	The usual.  Full house. Standing ovation.  I tell them it's magic...
2 ... they believe you.	Yeah.  Remember Quaid?
3 Sure.	Somebody killed him.
4 Oh God.	I just saw him.

1 I'm not saying another word.  You damn fool.  He's a journalist.	Just tell me about Swann.  Or are you too scared?
2 He was a freak.  Everything he did was tainted.

1 I want to speak to Dorothea.	I'm afraid she's not in.
2 When will she be in?

1 You need an ambulance.	Too late.  Why are you here? Did you cone... up here for a reading?

1 You know, it's such a fucking waste.  You can do shit most of us can only dream about, and you go around pretending it's some trick.	Illusionists get. Las Vegas contracts, D'Amour.  Magicians get burned.
2 Or murdered, like Nix.	He deserved it.
3 Maybe he doesn't see it that way. Maybe he's digging his way out of the hole you put him right now.  That's what you're hiding away from, isn't it?	I did it for Dorothea.
4 Oh yeah?	Now that I'm dead, the spotlight's off her.

1 This is where we killed him.	You didn't try hard enough.
2 I can't... I can't go any further...

1 And?	I should have been honest with you, right from the start.  I wasn't born to show people the error of their ways.  I was born to murder the world.

1 You really are having a mid-life crisis.	I know, it's stupid.

1 Hans was very attentive to you.	I think he kind of liked me...Is that so hard to imagine?
2 No, its easy.	How'd a Japanese guy get a name like Hans?
3 I don't know.

1 What happened to your toe?	I don't know, I think maybe I broke it? I knocked into something the other day...

1 When are you leaving?	Tomorrow.
2 I'm going to miss you.	That's what you said the other night.
3 Well, I mean it more now.

1 Yeah, its really different here.	Well, that's good, I have to get the kids off for school.  Can I call you in a little while?
2 It's four in the morning... I'm going to go to sleep.	Ok, well... I love you.
3 I love you, too, good-night, or good- morning .	Good-night.

1 How'd it go today?	Good...I'm tired.

1 Will you please stop smoking?	But I like to... and I don't smoke that much.
2 Its bad for you.	Ok, I will... later.

1 ...doing like twenty million interviews a day... It's soo good to see you. How long are you here for?	We're here for the week. I'm shooting in Osaka for a few days.
2 It's amazing  there!	Have you met Charlotte? My wife.
3 No!  Hi! So great to meet you!

1 Oh, Peter, you're going to pursue this.	No.  Of course not.  Mmmm.  Anago.  My favorite.

1 She's been stalking you, Peter.	So you're going to kill her?  Put the gun down Claire.

1 When your secretary called, she made no mention of her coming, too.	My secretary?
2 You're aware that this woman was party to the so-called exorcism.	No, I wasn't, actually.
3 You should know I never felt Mr. Birdson needed anything but professional psychiatric care.  And then, minutes after they left, he suffered a stroke. He's comatose.  No brain wave activity at all.

1 How're you doing?  Looking lovely as always.	You ready?

1 So I guess Satan lost.  Satan is the weak one.	Miette, come here and relax.

1 So...what did you think of the tape.	I think you gave me the wrong one.
2 What do you mean?	It was blank.  Nothing on it.  You gave me the wrong one.

1 Do you know your parents' blood types?	I looked at the coroner's report.  My father's O positive and my mother...A negative.
2 Peter, your blood-type is AB negative. There's no way your birth father can be O positive.  You father is not who you think he is.	So...then the coroner's report is probably wrong.  I mean...this is ridiculous.  There's been a mistake.  I don't believe any of this.
3 Then why are you here?

1 It'll happen at the exact time of your birth.	That can't be right.  My birthday's tomorrow.

1 He was trying to tell me something.	And his message was  "Together, no matter what?"

1 But she worships you.  Your mother's dead but your father's alive.	Nothing you couldn't find out from reading the papers.  And you're already wrong on one count.
2 Viznick will get off and Michael's got a crush on you.

1 So, Viznick's got a meet with his lawyer in the ayem.	Really?  You know, seeing these guys away from the court, the facade slips. You catch things.
2 Yeah, yeah.  I've heard it before.  Just be sure you spell my name right.  Nine o'clock?

1 Monica, what did you do?	Nothing.
2 Oh, all that work.

1 What?	Whenever you lose, you get this attitude. But it's just a game.

1 Which one for tomorrow?	The blue.
2 You sure?

1 You know, girl, long as I've lived next door, I've never seen the inside of this house.	Really?  Well, come on, then.

1 My mouth is kinda dry.	Then I'll get you some punch.

1 That too tight?	No.
2 Mom's going to hate it.	Always on my ass, anyway.
3 Like you don't give her a hard time.	Just cause I don't kiss her booty like you...

1 What's up with that?	Hey, don't take it personal.  And don't think just cause we play the same position we have to compete with each other.  We're teammates, okay?
2 Thanks, Sidra.	Besides.  I've been starting point the last two years.  Ain't no way some dumb- ass freshman is taking my spot.

1 Told you I was nice.  I'm going to be the first girl in the NBA.	I'ma be in the NBA.  You're gonna be my cheerleader.

1 Why she gotta be a ho, just cause she wants to get with me.	She's a ho cause she's sending her coochie through the mail.
2 And?	And?  She's not saying, "I think you're a nice guy and I wanna get to know you better," she's saying, "I wanna bone."
3 So she's honest.	Yeah, an honest tramp-ass ho.  But I guess you'll stick your dick in anything.
4 Didn't know you cared so much.	I don't.
5 So who you going to the dance with, Spalding?	Who's Spalding?

1 Four.	What?
2 You had four offensive rebounds.

1 Kiss my booty.	Plan to.

1 You know what, I'm just gonna crash.	Fine...Maybe I'll come by later.
2 Nah.  I have curfew.

1 Just something I'm trying.	No, it looks good.  I mean, it's cool.
2 Thanks.

1 What's going on?	We need to talk.

1 Zeke.	What?  Oh, and, uh, don't say "shit."

1 Quincy, I told you about these fat-ass girls.	We were just studying.
2 I'm not playing with you, these girls are looking to get you caught.  They see you, they see dollar signs.	Okay.
3 You hearing me?	I've been hearing you.

1 Besides, the sooner you go pro, the sooner you'll have to deal with the mess I'm dealing with.	What mess?
2 there's this thing out there.  This paternity suit.	What?
3 Some girl that's been hanging on at every party.  now I'm supposed to be her baby's Daddy.  Anyway, I told your mom I wanted to be the one who told you.	Tell me what?
4 I just told you.	I mean, it's not true, is it?

1 You smell like trouble --	I'm fuckin' hammered, Burt.
2 You ok?	ooohhhhhh no.

1 What do you want? Why are you here?	I'd like to talk to you.  Your boyfriend let me in, I just knocked on the door --
2 He's not my boyfriend.

1 For what?	Ok. For one thing, we're gonna need to turn that music down so we can talk, ok?
2 I'm sorry.

1 --- yeah, yeah, I get in it in my ear. It's TMJ is what it's called technically.	What's that stand for?
2 Tempural-something-mandibular, thing with something, I dunno. But it affects my ear, I don't even know if I have TMJ exactly but just very tight, like - it's like a muscle spasm and it's just gets so clenched --

1 No, what's wrong?	You mind if I come in, check things?

1 Let's go, c'mon, get up --	Did we win or lose, I mean --?
2 I don't know, Richard, they need to talk it over --

1 Did you listen to me?	I was listening --
2 -- I told you who did it and you're not listening to me.	-- and I'm through playin' games.

1 It was the lovely Samuel Johnson who also spoke of a fella "Who was not only dull but a cause of dullness in others."	"The" cause of dullness in others --
2 Picky, picky.	-- and lemme tell you this: Samuel Johnson never had his life shit on and taken from him and his money stolen -- who took his life and his money?  His parents? His mommy and daddy?  Make him live this life like this -- "A man of genius" gets shit on as a child and that scars and it hurts and have you ever been hit by lighting? It hurts and it doesn't happen to everyone, it's an electrical charge that finds it's way across the universe and lands in your body and your head -- and as for "ruined but by himself," not if his parents take his friggin' life and his money and tell you to do this and do that and if you don't? well, what --

1 I've been a good worker --	Don't do this, Don.

1 ...find him on the...Frank. His name's Frank Mackey --	Frank Mackey.  That's your son?
2 that'snotmy name...find Lily, gimmme that, give it --

1 Time's up.  Thank you for the interview.	So you sat it out, that's what you did?
2 You requested my time and I gave it you, you called me a liar and made accusations. And you say, "If I'd known I wouldn't have asked," then it's not an attack?  Well, I don't wanna be the sort of fella who doesn't keep his word.  I gave you my time, Bitch. So fuck you now.

1 So....Phil....um...I think I'm gonna step in and try and see him and say something if he can...talk...I mean:	...ok...
2 Can you stand...back...maybe, I mean... just a little bit...in the room is ok, but back from us a little...	yeah.

1 What the hell is this Marcie?	THAT'S NOT MINE.

1 We are not on display.  I am not a doll. I AM NOT A DOLL...I' M NOT SILLY AND CUTE. I'M SMART SO THAT SHOULDN'T MAKE ME SOMETHING, SOMETHING SO PEOPLE CAN WATCH HOW SILLY IT IS THAT HE'S SMART?  I KNOW.  I KNOW THINGS. I KNOW. I HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM I HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM AND I HAVE TO GO.	I'm sorry, Stanley.

1 ...say it, Jimmy...	Do you know the answer to this?
2 I'm asking you.  I'm asking you if you know why Clauida will not speak to you....please, Jimmy....tell me.	I think that she thinks I may have molested her.

1 Was it a call back?	No.  But I probably will get a call back.
2 If we beat the record, you might get a call back --	I'll get it because I'm a good actress, Richard.
3 Saucy-saucy.

1 You don't do that, you don't call him, you don't know to get involved in the bussiness of his, of his of <u>my</u> family. this is the <u>family</u>, <u>me</u> and <u>him</u> do you understand?  You understand? NO ONE ELSE. THERE IS NO ONE ELSE.  That man, his son does not exist.  HE IS DEAD.  HE IS DEAD and WHO TOLD YOU TO DO THAT?	Earl asked me, Linda, please, Linda, I'm sorry -- Earl asked me --
2 BULLSHIT. BULLSHIT HE DIDN'T ASK YOU, HE DOESN'T WANT HIM, HE DOESN'T WANT TO TALK TO HIM, SO FUCK YOU THAT HE ASKED THAT. THERE IS NO ONE BUT ME AND HIM.

1 Did you piss your fuckin' pants, Stanley?	Shut up -- shut up --

1 I didn't I'm fine, I'm fine.	Stand up.
2 I said I'm fine.

1 Oh God I -- Forgive me...	M'lady...?

1 Louis, please -- !	My guards are useless!  Take her from me!

1 What are they doing?	Making the key to the throne.

1 Now.  You were saying?	But -- what is he doing?
2 About to hang himself, I should think.

1 Look at us.  We are old men now.  But once we were young.  And when we saw injustice, we fought it.	We have grown wiser with age.  Now we know that some problems cannot be settled with a sword.

1 Aramis... is this the way to hell?	Hell may be our destination, dear Porthos, but not this trip.

1 Let's see you rob somebody with your pistol there!	Come on...

1 "Phillippe has been removed to the Bastille, to the lower dungeon.  At midnight tonight I will order the guard changed, and will delay the replacements for ten minutes.  That should give you ample time.  Never have I needed more to say:  One for all, and all for one.  D'Artagnan."	He lures us to capture.

1 Thanks, but not for me.	You can't drink with a friend you haven't seen in months?
2 I have ordered a drill of the Royal Guard for midnight, and must be clear-headed for it.	Midnight!  Mon dieu!  Driving the youngsters hard, eh?
3 They must stay sharp.  There was an attempt on the King's life today.	Another?  How many times have you saved his life in this year alone? Three?  Four?
4 I heard your playing.	I was feeling sorry for myself. Raoul is getting married, he proposed today!  I love that boy beyond all measure, I've spent everything I own to give him education and opportunity.  Now he has complete happiness, and I mope.

1 Recent hours have been a shock.	Perhaps not as much as you might imagine.  When tutors answered every question except those about who I was.  When I was imprisoned in a way no other man had ever been, I knew there was something different about me.  But a king...
2 Phillippe... there is something I hope you understand.  Terrible cruelty has been used against you. And... you must understand that you did nothing to deserve it.	There is... wrath... in me.  I have learned to hide it.  Those years in the cell, I dreamed that freedom would someday just happen, the way the mask happened.  Now I am free. And with each free breath I feel the growing desire to make someone suffer for all I lost.  Look at this, all this that for ten years I could not see!  What if I become a king -- a king no different from my brother?
3 The desire for vengeance... can be a poison.	What is its antidote?
4 I suppose... it is to remember there are many people who have never been in a prison, who pass such beauty every day, and never see it.

1 This place... I once lived in a country house.  I had guardians -- an old man and woman.  And tutors. But no friends.  Then when I was twelve, they came and took me to the prison.	Who came?
2 A man in black.  I never saw his face.  He took me to the cell.  A blacksmith came and they put me into the mask.  For days I shouted, "What have I done?  Why do you do this to me?"  But no one heard, so I just stopped shouting.	And you never knew why?

1 I want all these passages sealed! Another stupid idea of my father's! Seal them all, every one!	It shall be done, your Majesty.
2 Even the bedchamber passages!  Let none remain!	Yes, your Majesty.

1 What number did you tear out?	Eh?
2 What number, on the first page?	... Two-thirty-seven.
3 Two-thirty-seven:  "... And the descendants of Japeth are these: Obediah, Zebulon, Hezekiah..."

1 Majesty... We have more than enough food set aside for your birthday celebration next week.  If we distributed some of that, we would have time to gather more before --	Aramis!  I have been expecting you!  We are satisfied, that will do.

1 Raoul... Oh, Raoul...	Listen, my darling... Raoul was a... a good friend.  And now he is dead and that is very sad but --
2 We'll burn in hell.  Both of us.

1 Bullshit...	Did you report it stolen?

1 Let's roll -	Right behind you.

1 Alright, where is she?	And who are you?
2 Who am I?  I'm gonna be your worst fucking nightmare until you start breaking it down for me.  You understand? Where did you get the car!	I'm done talking until I get a lawyer.

1 Something I don't already know?	Well it's just kind of a coincidence, isn't it?  Stanton and Fleming, both started in '83, both in area six...both in Vice?

1 You know, you don't seem afraid of much either.  How do you know I'm not going to try to rape you?	Figure you would have tried it already.

1 You are drunk.  You know, it's been a long time and I'd love to catch up, but I really got to -	Tubbs listen!  I don't know anywhere else to go!  I need your help!
2 Just what did you get yourself into, Jimmy?	It's...it's a long story.  Can we meet somewhere?
3 Jesus, man...	Please...

1 Donut?	No thanks.  How do you know they can't catch you on this thing?
2 I don't, but I'm pretty sure. It's a long story but I cloned a cellular linkup with a binary code scrambler and sent it through the phone network mainframe.  If they start a trace it will be to a Pic'n'Save on Pico.	I knew I could count on you.
3 I got a lot of free time, you know what I mean?

1 I'm stranded out here.	Hop in.

1 What have we missed?	He may have an unconscious homosexual conflict. A fear of being gay. He objects to the word 'fairy.' Plus smeared bloodstains indicate that he put the shorts on Charles Leeds after he was dead.  I believe he did this to emphasize his lack of interest in Mr. Leeds.

1 Willingham, when he tossed his cell, took Polaroids so they could get everything back in place...	Have him meet me with pictures of Lecktor's books...
2 Where?	Library of Congress.

1 A cat. We found a litter box downstairs but not the cat.  Neighbors are watching for it.	Why don't you get Birmingham P.D. a methane probe out of D.C. and have them cover the backyard...  maybe the cat's dead and the kids buried it.

1 Run it.	What if it encourages the Tooth Fairy to do something besides write?
2 We will feel sick for a very long time.

1 It's the guard in the storeroom.	We want the cans the Jacobi home movies came in.  They're in the far corner of the room under the windows.
2 There's some film cans in the far corner of the room underneath one of the windows.

1 ...but if we find him, the print as evidence will get a conviction, Hold on. What?	He asked for Will. He said he might call back tonight. I tried to hold him... I'm sorry... He said 'tell Graham "broken mirrors."'
2 Will. Get right back here. He just called.

1 How did you come to Gateway?	They had to shape up their employment practices to keep this defense contract.

1 Am I alone in this room? Are you here...  Why are you doing this?!	Some remarkable events have happened in Birmingham and Atlanta.  Do you know what I'm talking about?

1 Look at the screen. That is William Blake's 'The Great Red Dragon and The Woman Clothed with the Sun.'  Do you see?	Yes...

1 The consensus around here is that the only person who has demonstrated any practical understanding of Dr. Hannibal Lecktor is you, Mr. Graham. Can you tell me anything about him?	No.
2 When you saw Dr. Lecktor's murders, their 'style,' so to speak, were you able to reconstruct his fantasies? And did that help you identify him?

1 He's very strong physically.	That's true.
2 He's white and six feet tall. You haven't told me anything yet.	Describe exactly what you think he did to Mrs. Leeds and I'll tell you if you're right or not.
3 I don't want to do that,	Goodbye.

1 Molly, dear Molly. Go to bed now, baby...	I love you...

1 Let's forget who said what to whom...	You got a deal...

1 What kind of coffee do you like?	Huh?
2 You like that Colombian stuff, don't you?

1 ...if he's smart he'll approach from the front, pass, and take you from the back. How well do you hear?	Pretty well.
2 I'm gonna spray your suit jackets. It'll be invisible in this light, but you'll stand out like a zebra for us.  They told me you checked out a .44 Charter Arms Bulldog.	Yes.
3 Good. You'll load these, Ever fire them?

1 You have to do it.	I refuse.
2 LISTEN, you arrogant putz!  I've been in this business for twenty years!  I know!  If you walk away from this opportunity, you will never, NEVER see another one like it again!!!!

1 Hi, George!  Good to hear from you!	Hi, Andy.  How's the weather up there?
2 Oh, you know the Bay Area!  Always foggy!

1 Hey!  Our first phone call!  Hello?	Andy... it's me.  I've got some crummy news.  Taxi's been canceled.

1 Did your -- doctor say it's okay for you to go back to work?	Ehhh, you know those guys.  If he had his way, I'd be stuck in the hospital, running tests all day.  And anyway, I've found a new guy who's gonna be able to instantly remove the cancer.
2 Really?	Yeah!  He's a psychic surgeon in the Philippines, and he's amazing!  He rubs you and sucks the disease right out!

1 Five.	Twenty!
2 Ten.	Deal.

1 Andy, the theater's that way!	Hey, I love movie theater popcorn... but that doesn't mean I have to sit through "On Golden Pond."

1 Ooo, the little lady's upset.  Well I say -- get back in the kitchen!	No!  YOU get in the kitchen.  I'm gonna make you dry my dishes!

1 T-there wasn't a reason to purposely hurt me --	You're a wimp.
2 My father said I should've gotten a lawyer --!	Then your father's a wimp.
3 And you're just poor white trash!

1 I was very original!	Yeah, exactly -- "was"!  But now, you're creatively bankrupt.  In fact, Ladies and Gentlemen, Kaufman's so desperate, he PAID me to do this tonight!!  I'm a plant. It's just a fresh coat of paint on an old broken-down routine.  Isn't that true???

1 Look -- I gotta be clear with you. Tony Clifton is NOT Andy Kaufman.	Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I know!  Wink wink!  Nudge nudge!
2 No, I'm serious.  If you book Tony, do NOT EXPECT TO GET ANDY.	I'll take my chances!!

1 Yeah, he's just laying low, waitin' for his comeback.  God, listen to this!  "It was morally wrong to take advantage of such an unstable individual..."	Wow, you can't BUY this kind of publicity!

1 JESUS CHRIST!!!!!	Why isn't he MOVING??

1 Lieutenant?	Oh shit.
2 Lieutenant, you were given specific orders --	I'm just doing my job.  You gimme that Juris-my-dick-tion and you can cram it up your ass.
3 The orders were for your protection.

1 You ever have the feeling that you're not sure if you're awake or still dreaming?	All the time.  It's called mescaline and it is the only way to fly.

1 But you're out, Cypher.  You can't go back.	That's what you think.  They've promised to back me, Trinity. They're going to reinsert my body. I'll go back to sleep and when I wake up, I'll be fat and rich and I won't remember a goddamn thing. It's the American dream.

1 Operator.	I need an exit!  Fast!
2 Cypher?

1 Hello?	Hello, Neo.  Do you know who this is?

1 Welcome, Neo.  As you no doubt have guessed, I am Morpheus.	It's an honor.
2 Please.  Come.  Sit.

1 Morpheus, what's happened to me? What is this place?	More important than what is when?
2 When?	You believe the year is 1997 when in fact it is much closer to 2197.  I can't say for certain what year it is because we honestly do not know.

1 I thought it wasn't real.	Your mind makes it real.

1 Listen to me, Neo.  I know why you're afraid to go through that door.  You can't get free of thinking that I could be wrong.  You must believe me.  There is a greatness inside of you, Neo.  A greatness that is going to lift you to unimaginable heights and that in time will change the world.	Morpheus, I don't know --
2 I know.  That is why it is so important for you to go.  Please, Neo, I'm asking you to find whatever respect you may have for me and trust me.

1 Hello?	I know.  You're Neo.  Be right with you.
2 You're the Oracle?	Bingo.  Not quite what you were expecting, right?  I got to say I love seeing you non-believers. Always a pip.  Almost done.  Smell good, don't they?
3 Yeah.	I'd ask you to sit down, but you're not going to anyway.  And don't worry about the vase.
4 What vase?

1 How did you do that?	Right now, all I can tell you, is that you are in danger.  I brought you here to warn you.
2 Of what?	They're watching you, Neo.
3 Who is?	Please.  Just listen.  I know why you're here, Neo.  I know why you left your family and your friends, why you left your home to come to this city.  You're looking for him.

1 What does that mean?	That the Matrix cannot tell you who you are.
2 But an Oracle can.	That's different.
3 Is it?	Are you worried?
4 Should I be?	No.

1 What are you doing?	I'm going in after him.
2 You can't!	I have to.
3 Morpheus sacrificed himself so we could get you out!  There's no way you're going back in!	Morpheus did what he did because he believed that I'm something I'm not.
4 What?	I'm not the One, Trinity.  The Oracle hit me with that too.

1 Holy shit!	Hey, Mikey, he likes it!  Ready for more?
2 Hell yes!

1 Operator.	Tank, it's me.

1 No, really, I liked it...thought it was great.	Thanks.

1 Well, we got $40, and we wanna buy...	All right!  Quiet!  For $40 I could give you...

1 No.	Anybody wanna have a game?

1 Listen, try a place with some sun. Swimming pools.  Palm trees.  Girls in little French bathing suits.	Thanks for the ride.

1 I don't think I should go home looking like this.  You think I could stay at your place tonight? Your mother's not there is she?	No, she isn't.

1 Keep your mouth shut.	You tell me that in front of these creeps?

1 Hello, Michael.  I've got something for you...not much...but...	He has about twenty-eight bucks... it's all he has on him.

1 ...Charlie, don't you think you should be interested in Johnny's payments to me?  I think you should be, you know that.	Michael, nobody's out to screw you, I guarrantee that.
2 I know that Charlie but look at my side.  You undersigned the loans. You vouched for him.  What happens if this kid don't pay me?  I gotta collect from you?  I don't want to do that.  I made a deal with him not you, right?	You're right.  You're right.  Look, I'm not gonna wind up paying his debts.  You know that.

1 He could at least show some respect and show his face, even if he doesn't have the money...	'Amen I say to thee, thou wilt not come out from it until thou hast paid the last penny.'
2 You said it.

1 About Oscar...I think he put on this act...about the restaurant being in bad shape and all that. He can't make the payments...I don't know what to make of it.  He says Groppi's run off with a girl. I could help if you want.	No...his business is bad.  But I'll decide what to do and you...and you just keep out of anything that might...might...er draw attention to you.

1 Well, maybe you missed something?	Oh yeah, that's a possibility.

1 C'mon Charlie...one more day.  I'll call in sick for work.	No...we can come back in a couple of weeks.  Besides, if we're both gone for three days it wouldn't look right.
2 Ok.

1 Are you sure he didn't say anything to you about tonight?	For God's Sakes...I told you before...nothing.  Charlie, I can't stay in here too long at this hour...will you please listen to me?

1 How about me?  I don't get a drink John?	Of course!  A double for Michael, Tony.

1 -- But he does seem very nice.	You think so?

1 What, honey?	I lay awake nights in a cold sweat, I want this party to be like some- thing Mom would have made for you, I want it to be perfect --
2 I know you do, darling.	And you could care less --
3 Oh, you couldn't be more wrong, sweetheart.  I can' tell you how much I appreciate it and how I'm looking forward to it.	Good.  Songs.  What songs should Sidney -- Pancho and his six men we can forget about -- what songs do you think he should play?

1 Honey, please.	Okay.  All aboard - New York, New York!
2 Remember everybody, tonight, dinner in the city at Daddy's.  You too, Drew.  We've still got some loose ends --

1 What are you eating.	You mean this, sir?

1 We're not getting anywhere here. Why don't we take some of the best out of this thing, let's consider it coolly, let's take a week --	Bontecou wants a speedier response than that.
2 He'll wait --

1 Perhaps you could remind me.	I'll make a note of it.  Anything else?

1 Yeah, something he goes by --	Oh, excuse me.  This is -- uh -- this is --

1 Joe, cut it out.  And you too, Drew.	I thought this was practically a done deal --
2 Well now it's undone, okay?  Forget Bontecou!  Scrub him!  I'm tired of his fancy name and his fancy offer. I'm not going for it.

1 That's it?	Bontecou wants a quick response and --
2 The answer is no, quick enough for you?	Don't you want to hear the details?
3 I'm not interested in the details. And I'm not interested in the big picture either.  What I am inter- ersted in is how my Board got conven- ed behind my back, is entertaining a further proposal from a man whom it offends me to do business with, moreover has the audacity to present this to me like a prize fish, and I am expected to clap for it like a performing seal.  No, thank you.	So I am to understand from your re- sponse that you do not want to hear the details of Bontecou's offer?
4 Yes, you are to understand that, and now may I ask you a question?	Certainly, Bill.
5 Are you running this Board or am I?

1 I thought so, too.  Joe's a neat guy.	Yeah.  Neat.

1 Don' be facety, woman.	None facety, mistah.  You come for me?  Dat's good news.
2 No, I come to see Doctor.	Doctor?  What could be wrong wit' you?
3 Nuthin'.

1 Don't bother asking, we already tried.	It's so very nice to see you again.

1 'Big'?	You appear at his side out-of-the- blue, stay at his house, eat dinner with his family, it's practically a first.  You're in the red-hot center of big business and I thought you were a regular Joe.
2 I am Joe.	Not the one I met this morning, hit- ting on me in as nice a way as I've been hit on in a long time, but the moment you find out I'm my Dad's daughter, you act like a stranger.
3 That is not my intention.

1 Joe, I'm with Drew.	Not now.

1 You first.	Why don't you get off his case?

1 ...No.	Maybe it's the draft through the door.

1 The 'coffee shop' --	-- That was the place... and you were the guy.

1 If there is anything else, don't hesitate --	I won't.
2 How long have I got?	You're putting me on the spot, Bill.

1 What's it like?	What do you mean?
2 What's it like where I'm going?	Can you keep a secret?
3 Yes.	So can I.

1 And more.	Why didn't you stop me?
2 Well...I don't know.

1 I couldn't sleep.	I'm sorry to hear that.

1 Susan wants to come.  She says she's in love with me.	With you?!  Who is 'you'?  Did you tell her who you are?
2 No.	Does she know where she's going?

1 You are --?	'...Yes --'

1 Where are you?  Are you there?	It's enough now.
2 Please.  Talk to me --	There's going to be plenty of time for that.
3 What do you mean?!	I think you know --
4 Know what?  Know what, goddammit!

1 But he does give a shit.  Don't you, Bill?	Yeah, I give a shit.
2 See.  There.  What'd I tell you?

1 Well, thank you, that's great, but it's more than I bargained for.  I just wanted to set the record straight.	But we want you back, Bill.  Mean- while, enjoy your party, celebrate, we'll attend to the nasty details. And Mr. Black, may we say thank you.

1 I know it's a cornball thing but love is passion, obsession, someone you can't live without.  If you don't start with that, what are you going to end up with?  I say fall head over heels.  Find someone you can love like crazy and who'll love you the same way back.  And how do you find him?  Forget your head and listen to your heart.  I'm not hearing any heart.  Run the risk, if you get hurt, you'll come back.  Because, the truth is there is no sense living your life without this.  To make the journey and not fall deeply in love -- well, you haven't lived a life at all. You have to try.  Because if you haven't tried, you haven't lived.	Bravo.
2 Aw, you're tough.	I'm sorry.  But give it to me again. The short version.
3 Stay open.  Who knows?  Lightning could strike.

1 That was wonderful.	Yeah, it's good to get together.
2 Do you mind if I raise a little caution flag?	Raise away.
3 What is the nature of your interest in Joe?	Well, remember how you told me about "lightning striking"?  The nature of it's in there somewhere.

1 Are you relieved?	Yes, but --

1 Not at all.	How 'bout another cup of coffee?
2 I've got patients coming in --	And I want to get into my apartment and go to work.  Please, what do you say, another cup of coffee?

1 78.	I know about your fucking condition, Leonard! I probably know more about it than you do! You don't have a fucking clue about anything else!

1 Should I wear it?	No. Just leave the stuff lying around as if it were yours. Like you just took it off or something.
2 Whatever gets you off.

1 So how many rooms am I checked into in this dump?	Just two. So far.         *

1 Why?	I don't want blood on them.
2 Wait! Did he tell you what I was bringing?	Strip!
3 Look, there's two hundred grand stashed in the car. Just take it!

1 Guess I don't have to worry about him anymore.	Who is he? What have you got me into?

1 Give him some bruises of his own and tell him to look for a guy called Teddy.	He'll kill you, Lenny.
2 My wife used to call me Lenny.	Yeah?
3 Yeah, I hated it.	This guy's dangerous, let's think of something else.

1 * Depends on if he's here in town. Or if he's moved on. See, I've got all this -   *	Can I ask you something?

1 Chronic alcoholism ~ one cause of short term memory loss.	Are you Teddy?
2 My name's Leonard.        *	Did Teddy send you?
3 I don't know.

1 This is your car.	You're in a playful mood.

1 I don't think so.	Think so? You don't know? Didn't you write it down?
2 I might have fallen asleep before I did.

1 Unfinished business.	Lenny, as a buddy, let me inform you. Your business here is very much finished. You're still here because of Natalie.
2 Who's she?

1 Why?	Why? Come on, Leonard, we talked about this. It's not safe f or you to be walking around like this.
2 Why not?

1 My wife wasn't diabetic.	Are you sure?

1 Bullshit.       *	His name's James F. Grantz, John G. Check     * your tattoos.        *

1 She's sending a message.  Meth Lab. Trailer park.  Anything with interesting antenna arrays...?	There's three between Miami International and the glades.  I'm gonna try for her, but this is triage.  Protect the maximum number of lives.  You need to know that...

1 I don't know.	Yes you do...
2 I got to talk to my ADO...	No, you don't, Jim.  'Cause if I close this down, you got nothing to make a phone call about.  And my guys don't have a week for a Feeb bureaucratic process.  Every hour longer they're in there, they risk exposure.  So, right here, right now, they're back in or I pull them out and close you down.  What's it going to be?

1 My cousin is the harbor master. You must not bring in drugs.  You cannot be armed.  If you're carrying, it has to go.  Or stow it inside.  No one will go near your boat...	You do business in Cuba with your husband?
2 I never do business in Cuba.  And nobody goes to Cuba but me.  And he is not my husband...

1 Hola, chica.	Hola, viejo.

1 Jos...	Sonny Burnett...this is my partner, Rico.
2 Sit.

1 What friend?	Mrs. Rico.  But don't worry.  She is safe.  To insure that, I am keeping her close to me.  It's always good to keep people your friends care about close to you.

1 People gonna walk into this place and say, "Ola, hijo!  That some crazy wallpaper.  Whew...it wild! Is that a Jackson Pollack?"	"No, viejo.  That was Jos Yero, splattered all over his motherfucking wall."
2 So we can close each other's eyes right now.  Real easy.  Real fast.  But, then, nobody makes any money...

1 Where the hell are you, man?	On my way back...

1 If we were for real, and knew our shit, we'd fade this one...	Then you should.
2 If you're down, we're down for the play.

1 Control your men.	I'm my <u>own</u> man.  And anytime you want to see how much man I am?

1 Oh, good...	...what else, what else did he indicate to you?  I need to know everything he said.

1 You mean with the flowers...?	What's it say?
2 "Salutations from the south..."

1 Conveyance?	Maritime.  Jose will fill you in.

1 I walk into Neptune's house...very nice.  But I also see you... and our drugs that got ripped from Maguda.	You don't like us finding your load?  We can go and lose it all over again...

1 What you gonna do back there, East?	Lotta rich women back there...
2 Yeah?	Men, they mostly faggots.
3 Must be some mess back there.	Well, ain't no use hanging around here.
4 Ain't gonna collect your pay?	I got me two hundred twenty-four bucks of flat folding money...  He know what he can do with that chicken-shit day's pay. And if he ain't man enough to do it for himself, I be happy to oblige!

1 Cut it out. That's cheating, teasing me so I can't think. Just one bitsy Y word and I gonna beat you!	You gonna beat me, Joe?
2 Beat your butt, you don't lemme think!	Gay ends in Y. Fey. You like that -- gay fey -- is that your problem?
3 I show you what problem --

1 Listen, keep away from me, hear? You come near me again, I snatch you bald-headed!	I'm inviting you. I mean if you're not located, I got a place. I'm inviting you, goddamit.
2 You inviting shee-it.

1 Miami Beach is the only place for a real hustler. Florida has more rich chicks per square yard than any resort spot in the world. They lie out in their pagodas and pergolas waiting to grab the first jockstrap that passes.	What's all this sweet talk about Florida? Your friend O'Daniel got a stable down there now?

1 Well, this thought just struck me. It wasn't too long ago I was washing dishes way the hell somewhere in Texas.	Yeah, well, so?
2 Now I'm here. I'm in New York City. Getting picked for things. Don't you see what I'm driving at?	What you're driving at, you want me to get lost so you can go to your fancy-ass party.
3 Did I say that? Did I?  It don't say nothing about you...	Don't say nothing about you either.
4 But they picked me, right? So what I'll do, I'll just say, now look, you want me? Well, I don't go nowhere without my buddy here.	Well, what the hell, I got nothing better to do.

1 If you have to shiver, why don't you pull the blanket up more?	I been thinking. I hope we're not gonna have a lotta trouble about my name down there. Because like what's the whole point of this trip anyway?
2 Keep the goddam blanket on.	I mean New York's one thing, but can you see this guy, imagine it, running around the goddam beach all suntan and he's going in swimming, like, and then somebody yells 'Hey, Ratso' -- how does that sound to you?
3 Sounds like they knew you.	Sounds like crap, admit it. And I'm not gonna have it. I'm Rico all the time, okay, do you blame me? That's agreed, okay? We're gonna tell all these new people my name's Rico?

1 Am I tickled to find you, boy! Come on in and let's get a look at you. Turn around. Good strong back. You'll need it. So you want help -- take a seat, relax, tell me about yourself. Cowboy, huh?	No sir, I'm no cowboy really, but I'm a first class stud.
2 Take it,easy, boy...  Seems to me you're different than a lotta boys that come to me. Most of 'em seem troubled, confused, but I'd say you knew exactly what you want.	You bet I do, sir.
3 But I'll bet you got one thing in common with them other boys. I'll bet you're lonesome.	Well, not too, I mean, a little.

1 The kids? Why are they...	Little fuckers are thieves, rapists, pickpockets, murderers, you name it - they do it. Don't trust any of 'em...

1 Who?	Ziat!

1 Where you staying, Dad?	The Hilton.
2 How do you like it?  Istanbul?	Well, it's an interesting place...  Tell you the truth, I think the food is lousy. The crap they sell in these little restaurants. I went out to eat in one of them last night, and I had to run to the damn toilet... You shoulda' seen the toilet.

1 ...are you with the Consulate?	Something like that. Cigarette?

1 New people sometimes get on his nerves.	What did he do?

1 What do you mean LIFE FOR FOR WHAT! FOR WHAT!	Billy!  Please!

1 Goddamn Gastro's killing me.  Making me blind. Hey Billy!	Yeah.
2 I got some acid man.  Maybe we can drop some on the guards huh? In their tea or something.

1 Never was anybody like you...	You can't take anything seriously.
2 You're right.

1 What'd the Prosecutor say?	It's not important, just technical things. We make our case.  You were very good, you spoke well. The Judge like you. It look good. Don't worry.
2 Did you ask for bail?

1 Peter...	Yeah...?
2 There's some weird shit here.	Weird shit...?
3 Take a look.

1 Did you see the size of that thing?!	Look what you did! You stupid sonofa-

1 Is there a switch?	Third rail is dead.  Get me up.  There must be a manual override in the booth.

1 What are you putting that crap on me for?	Scent glands.  Insects use 'em to identify themselves to each other.

1 Do you think we did the right thing?	Taking a cab instead of hiring a limo?
2 You know what I mean...

1 Metaxonycha Godmani.	So?

1 It's me. Can you hear me?	Yeah, barely. We haven't found anything down here. Nothing...

1 Oh, come on, come on!	Jump in.

1 What's this?	Oh, right... They been here since noon. I told them you're real busy.

1 Must get lonely, living out here all by yourself.	I always say if you can't enjoy your own company, you're not fit company for anyone else.
2 You got a point there...

1 When do you think the phone lines'll be back up? I have to call my daughter, and I should call New York and let my agent know I'm breathing.	It shouldn't be too much longer.  Once the roads are open, the lines'll be up in no time. If you give me their numbers, I'll keep trying them for you.  Could I ask you a favor?  I noticed in your case there was a new Paul Sheldon book and...  and I wondered if maybe... 
2 You want to read it?	If you wouldn't mind.
3 I have a hard and fast rule about who can read my stuff at this early stage--only my editor, my agent, and anyone who saves me from freezing to death in a car wreck.	You'll never realize what a rare treat you've given me.

1 For a while I thought I might go crazy.	I know how that can be.
2 I don't know about you, but what I did to get through it was I dove into work--days, nights--night shifts can be lonely at a hospital. I did a lot of reading. That was hen I first discovered Misery. She made me so happy. She made me forget all my problems.  'Course, I suppose you had a little something to do with that too.

1 I do believe the winters are getting shorter and shorter every year. People say it has something to do with the ozone layer. What do you think?	I don't know.
2 Yeah, well, it's a theory. Here's your Novril.  How does tuna casserole sound for dinner?	Great.

1 I'm sorry, Paul. This is all wrong, you'll have to do it over again.	What? What happened to "I'll treasure whatever you do?"
2 Paul, it's not worthy of you. Throw it all out except for the part of naming that gravedigger after me. You can leave that in.	I really value your criticism, but maybe you're being a little hasty here.
3 Paul, what you've written just isn't fair.	--not fair?
4 That's right--when I was growing up in Bakersfield, my favorite thing in all the world was to go to the movies on Saturday afternoons for the chapter plays...	--cliff-hangers--
5 I know that, Mister Man--they also call them serials. I'm not stupid, you know.  Anyway, my favorite was Rocket Man, and once it was a no-brakes chapter, the bad guys stuck him in a car on a mountain road and knocked him out and welded the doors shut and tore out the brakes and started him to his death and he woke up and tried to steer and tried to get out, but the car went off a cliff before he could escape and it crashed and burned and--I was so upset and excited and the next week you better believe I was first in line and they always start with the end of the last week and there was Rocket Man trying to get out, and here came the cliff and JUST BEFORE the car went off he jumped free and all the kids cheered--  --but I didn't cheer, I stood right up and started shouting, "This isn't what happened last week--have you all got amnesia?--THEY JUST CHEATED US--THIS WASN'T FAIR--"

1 I've never had meatloaf this good, what do you do to it?	My secret is I only use fresh tomatoes, never canned. And to give it that little extra zip, I mix in some Spam with the ground beef.
2 Oh.  You can't get this in a restaurant in New York.

1 Now don't fuss, Paul.	Why would I run away? I'm a writer, Annie--it's all I am--and I've never written this well--even you said that this is my best, didn't you?

1 Virginia, when you're in this car, you're not my wife, you're my deputy.	Well, this deputy would rather be home under the covers with the Sheriff.

1 People sure like those Misery books.	I'm sure you know Paul's been going to the Silver Creek Lodge for years to finish his books.
2 Yeah, I understand he's been up here the last six weeks.	Not quite. I just called, and they said he checked out five days ago. Isn't that a little strange?
3 I don't know. Does he always phone you when he checks out of hotels?

1 I thought you were over it.	I am. Well, maybe not completely--

1 I said you're beautiful, Nyah.	Only because..it's spring..chalk it up  - to spring fever.

1 Bellerophen?  No time at all once I've got it.	Good.  Biocyte stock is just a week or two away from going through the roof.
2 What are you talking about?	An outbreak of <i>Chimera.</i>
3 Where?	In downtown Sydney for a start.

1 -- now here's the way it's going to work..Wallis, the shares outstanding are..	Ninety-three point four million.
2 Which means, Mr. McCloy, we have to get our hands on four hundred and eighty thousand options.  We'll borrow your thirty million to buy those options.  Your stock's never sold above thirty-one dollars a share.  We'll agree to buy at fifty.

1 Billy.  I think we got a problem.  Nyah's on the wing.  Up early.  Billy, do you copy?	Exactly where is she?
2 ..in the building...

1 Do you know me?	No.  Should I?
2 No.  You just looked as if you did.	No.  Just as if I'd like to.
3 Oh.  Well.  I think that can be arranged.	Not tonight.  Bad timing.  Sorry -
4 There's not enough time in the world for any of it to be bad.

1 Hola..	Hi.  Would you mind slowing down?
2 Where did you get this number?  I don't even have it!

1 Not that it matter much but..I seem to recall you staying something like, 'I was hoping we could work together.'	This wasn't what I had in mind, Nyah.
2 But it is what you'd like me to do. so tell me to do it..

1 Where do I meet you?	Betting table twelve off the paddock. Nyah, are you up to this?
2 I'll muddle through.

1 No.  Should I?	No.  You just looked as if you did.
2 No...

1 Not yet.  We did manage to pull any sensitive equipment and material out of our safehouse wreckage.	We could lock down passport control and all ports of authority, but that won't stop Ambrose, and beyond him, we don't know who else we're looking for -- all terrorist bank accounts of which we're aware are stable.  No deposits, no withdrawals.  Therefore no suspects.
2 We think we've got our finger on the buyer.	Do you?  Even assuming you're able to prevent Ambrose selling Chimera, you've now got an additional problem.  You destroyed all of Chimera at Biocyte.  If Ambrose is going to sell Chimera now, he'll have to do it by taking a pint or so of Miss Hall's blood to market.
3 Yes, I believe that's right.	But that leaves another seven or eight pints of Chimera.
4 You mean that leaves Miss Hall.	Yes, I believe that's right.  Now my understanding is that 20 hours after exposure, the victim becomes infectious. Highly infectious.

1 Nekhorvich specialized in recombining DNA molecules.  In the myth, Bellerophon killed Chimera, a recombinant monster with the head of a lion and the tail of a serpent who plagued the ancient world.  I think Nekhorvich has created a monster virus in Chimera and apparently the means to kill it in Bellerophon.	That simple, huh?
2 Why not?

1 Luther, I'm looking at security.	Oh. Uh. Commencing diversion.  Alarm in cosmetics.

1 To friends.	Yes, Anatoly, yes.

1 Satisfied?	All ten million.
2 Fold it.  Fold it tight.

1 They're dead.  Jim's dead.	Take off your coat.
2 What?	Take off your God damn coat!

1 Kittridge...	Bastard!

1 Passport, visas - you know the drill. We'll work the exfiltration thru Canada, debrief you at Langley.  Throw the Prague police a bone, you know toss them a few suspects.  Follow me?	Yeah.  I follow you.
2 We've lost enough agents for one night.	You mean <u>I've</u> lost enough agents for one night.

1 Krieger <u>did</u> have the NOC list.	Now I want you to hold onto it.
2 What makes you trust me?	Because if you knew what you were getting into, you never would have done it.
3 I'm not letting this list get out in the open.	Exactly, that's your job.  Tomorrow on the train, you can't let this list get out into the open.  What's the range of this thing?
4 It's hard to tell.  I'm gonna have to be close.	I'll get you close.

1 Zero body count.	We'll see.
2 Time up.

1 In position.  Jack open the door, let the package roll.	Roger that.  Opening doors now.
2 Stairway, youre wrapped, go to transport.

1 How was Chicago?	Wonderful.  Ran into a convention of auto dealers at the Drake Hotel.  You hear the one about the astronaut who comes back from the first manned flight to Mars after two years?  His wife's got a year old kid.  So he says "All right.  Who was it?  My friend Harry?"  She says no. "Oh, it was my friend Sammy."  She says it wasn't Sammy.  "Oh, I suppose it was my friend Lou."  "No, what's the matter, don't you think I have any friends of my own?!"

1 Jim...?	I was sitting in a cafe waiting for you and suddenly there she was, standing in the rain just outside the safe house..alive and beautiful..and thinking Im dead and gone.  God knows what shes had to do forget about me to keep going and get the job done, I..

1 Twenty-six, twenty-seven.  So far so good.	That's not so good for you, my friend.

1 Who's dead?	Nobody. Loretta is getting married.
2 Again? Johnny Cammareri.

1 I don't wanna talk about it.	Johnny Cammareri. I think it's great and about time. What's she gonna do with the rest of her life she don't get married?
2 I don't wanna talk about it.

1 You haven't once said you like my dress.	I like your dress.  It's very bright.

1 Have you come from my brother?	Yes.
2 Why?	I'm going to marry him.
3 You are going to marry my brother?	Yes. Do you want...
4 I have no life.	Excuse me.
5 I have no life. My brother Johnny took my life from me.	I don't understand.

1 Your blood.	All my life I have never reached a man. I knew that I would reach my husband, but I took my time and he was dead. Ronny.
2 Loretta.	I want to cut you open and crawl inside of you. I want you to swallow me.
3 I've got you.	Get all of me. Take everything.
4 What about Johnny?	You're mad at him, take it out on me, take your revenge on me! Take everything, leave nothing for him to marry! Hollow me out so there's nothing left but the skin over my bones. Suck me dry!
5 Alright. Alright. There will be nothing left.

1 So. Where are we sitting?	Come on.

1 Ronny!	Is Johnny here?
2 He's coming.	Good! We can get this out on the table.  I'm Ronny, Johnny's brother. 

1 Is there anything you want to tell us, honey?	You? No.

1 What about the wedding?	My mother is dying. When she is dead, I'll come back and we'll be married.
2 How near is she to death?	A week. Two weeks. No more.
3 Then let's set the date.	How about a month from today?
4 Must it be so definite? Can't we just say that we will be married when I get back?	Where? At the City Hall? No! I want the whole wedding or we will have Bad Luck. For a whole wedding to be planned, a date must be set.
5 Alright. A month. In a month.	A month from today?
6 Yeah.	I'll take care of it, Johnny. I'll take care of the whole thing. All you have to do is show up.

1 No.	Good. When you love them they drive you crazy cause they know they can. But you like him?
2 Oh yeah. He's a sweet man. I wanna have a big church wedding, Ma. And a reception.	And who's gonna pay for that?
3 Pop.

1 What about the moon?	Did you see it?
2 No.	Oh.
3 Listen, I gotta go. I'll take the deposit to the bank but I'll do the books tomorrow. I gotta go.	You gotta date?

1 So.	Where is she?
2 Out. I don't know where. I was waiting up for my husband.	It's late.
3 Yes.

1 May I presume to ask you a question?	Sure!
2 Do you have a girlfriend?	I am alone in the world.

1 Temperature's dropping.	Yes.
2 I guess you can't invite me in?	No.
3 People home.	No. I think the house is empty. I can't invite you in because I'm married and because I know who I am. You're shaking.
4 I'm a little cold.	You're a little boy and you like to be bad.
5 We could go to my apartment. You could see how the other half lives.	I'm too old for you.
6 I'm too old for me. That's my predicament.	Good night.

1 We didn't know what to think. You were so weird yesterday, and then this morning, we go to the bank and no bag.	WE NEVER SUSPECTED YOU!

1 Look! To maintain Velocity, a swallow needs to beat its wings four hundred and ninety three times every second.   right?	Please!
2 Am I right?	I'm not interested.

1 We shall do no such thing ... let us pass!	Oh, please!
2 Cut down a tree with a herring?  It can't be done!

1 Who are you who are so wise in the ways of science?	I am Arthur, King of the Britons.
2 My liege ... forgive me ...

1 There!  Look!	What does it say?

1 Too late.	What?
2 There he is!

1 Come and see the violence inherent in the system. Help, help, I'm being repressed!	Bloody peasant! 
2 Oh, Did you hear that!  What a give-away.	Come on, patsy.

1 Who approaches the Bridge of Death Must answer me These questions three! Ere the other side he see.	Ask me the questions, Bridgekeeper.  I am not afraid.
2 What is your name?	My name is Sir Launcelot.
3 What is your quest?	To find the Holy Grail.
4 What is your favorite colour?	Blue.
5 Right.  Off you go.

1 I think I'll be all right to come with you, sir.	I will send help, brave friend, as soon as I have accomplished this most daring, desperate adventure in this genre.
2 Really, I feel fine, sir.	Farewell, Concorde!
3 It just seems silly ... me lying here.

1 Who are you?	I'm ... your son ...
2 Not you.

1 The Castle Anthrax?	Yes.  It's not a very good name, is it?  But we are nice and we shall attend to your every ... every need!
2 Er ... +      You are the keepers of the Holy Grail?	The what?  But you are tired and you must rest awhile.  Midget! Crapper!

1 Look, it's my duty as a knight to try and sample as much peril as I can.	No, no, we must find the Grail.

1 When you have found the shrubbery, then you must cut down the mightiest tree in the forest ... with a herring.	Yes!  With a herring!  With a herring!  Cut down with a herring!

1 So?	So, there are rules.  Things you do and things you don't do.
2 I was just telling the woman how I feel, for God's sake.	You don't tell Her Majesty how you feel.
3 I speak as I find, Archie.	Not down south you don't.

1 My lips may give a message better of Christmas love than e'en this letter.  To my best friend, J.B. from his best friend, V.R.  Best friend!	Aye.
2 She means it.

1 Mr Disraeli.  Ma'am.	Your Royal Highness.  What a pleasure to see you here.
2 Have you met Mr Lyle?  He's in sugar...?	I don't think I've had that pleasure.

1 Mr. Carter, the Head Butler, sits there.	Not now he doesn't.  This is my place.
2 By whose authority?	My own.

1 Go inside at once.	Is that the Queen's request?
2 Yes, it most certainly is!

1 The look on their faces when one walks into the room.  Still gives one a ridiculous thrill.	I wouldn't know.
2 Surely --	What I do, I do for my Queen.
3 Was there never ambition?	Maybe, once.
4 Then I envy yo.	Why?
5 To have achieved one's ambition, or to have reconciled oneself to its limits, is a lifetime's work.	I do what I do.
6 For Her Majesty.	Aye.
7 But yourself?  What about John Brown?	I said.  I serve the Queen.
8 No other aspiration?

1 Prince Albert was going to build a bench here.  He thought it one of the best views in Osborne.	It's a fine spot, ma'am.
2 He thought so, yes.

1 Am I not safe enough with you, John?	Aye.  But there are Fenians reported on the mainland.
2 The threat from the Irish is greatly exaggerated, I'm sure.	I'll decide when it's exaggerated.

1 Then they may read about me.	Indeed, and for that they are eternally grateful.
2 Is that not enough?	In so many ways ... and yet it is your presence they crave.  A figurehead.

1 A distinct flushing around the cheeks. She was drunk, I tell you.	No, she wasn't.

1 It's Mr Brown, ma'am.	What is he doing there?
2 He appears to be ... standing by his horse.	I made no request to go out riding today.  How long has he been there?
3 I don't know, ma'am.  He was observed earlier, I believe.

1 What do they want?	They are demanding the dismissal of John Brown on grounds of drunkeness.

1 Thanks, Albert.  Think you could print up those schematics?	Sure.

1 He thinks I'm "sublimating".	What the hell does that mean?

1 What do you mean by "weird"?	Greg never came home.  A few hours is one thing, Nick, but this is different. Something's happened to him.

1 We have to find out what's happened to them. I think they're gone...	No way.
2 If they're sick, great.  But let's make sure.  Come on, Nick.	Okay.  We'll see what's up.  But if things are cool, I don't want to hear anything more about this.  Life's too short, know what I mean?

1 SLIP-STREAM.	What?
2 They made ARCADE.  It's still a game, right?  It thinks like a game.  Maybe it still has to play by the rules. Someone had to program it in the first place, didn't they?.

1 I don't understand.  It wants us to play the game.  It's been taunting us ...	Put in a quarter.
2 It can turn itself on, Alex!  It doesn't need a quarter.	Yes it does.  Don't you see?  We have to play by the rules.  That's what it wants.

1 And we've still got time left.  This was a piece of cake.	Yeah, that's what worries me.

1 Listen to me, Alex.  These counselor's don't know anything.  They're full of shit. If you don't fit the pattern of the perfect kid, they freak.	I know.
2 So tell me you're okay, then.	I'm okay.
3 Good.   Cause I'd freak if you weren't.

1 Think!  I want to go to the City of Truth, and the Truth Teller is from there...but which one is which?  The liar...think!	You have no time.  What is your question?
2 I'm thinking!	You have no time.

1 It means she's screwed up.	Fucked up.  That's what they said I was.

1 We'd be happy to put her in the pile for considerations ... you'd be pleased to know there's quite a lot of interest in this role.	Interest?! There's six of the top actresses that want this thing.

1 No, I don't.	That's good. They're allowed, but I don't like 'em...for obvious reasons. One man used to live here that had a prize fighting kangaroo. You wouldn't believe what that kangaroo did to this courtyard ... let's see your Aunt's apartment ... it's a good one.
2 I can hardly wait, Coco.

1 My name is Rita.	Hi...do you work with my Aunt?

1 Yes?	Diane?
2 Number 17.	But it said #12.
3 I switched apartments with her. She's in #17. Just walk down that way. It's just to the right.

1 Okay... but just...just to see.	Just to see if there was an accident on Mulholland Drive.
2 Okay.	Come on... let's find you something to wear.

1 Oh, no wonder I'm starving. I'm going to fix a sandwich. You want one?	I'm all right.
2 You've got to eat something. You're just nervous about going over to see if you're Diane Selwyn.

1 You're so easy.	Gotta keep an eye on her, that's all.
2 Yeah, what for?	Keep her from gettin' in trouble, that's all.

1 So man, that's unheard of ... an accident like that ... who coulda foreseen that.	Unreal ... so, you're looking good. Whatcha doin' these days?
2 Well, not much Ed. Just doin' some stuff for this guy.	Making ends meet, huh.
3 Hardly.	Yeah, look at my digs ... times are tough.
4 Oh, things aren't so bad. Gee, I hope you're not goin' to get in any trouble.	It was just a thing. The story made you laugh.
5 Yeah, that's a funny story.

1 I'll do the standard research and have them in by midnight, pending any unforseen problems.	Good. Nice to see you, Bruce. Johnny.

1 Come on, it works.	Give me a fucking.....

1 I... I .....	You didn't think about it did you ? I read your file. It said you had a nervous breakdown.
2 I wanted to let his family know....	Know what ? That it was your fault ?
3 It wasn't my fault. I was just part of a team. I was doing my job...	So was I. So don't give me any shit. Your business is just as bad. At least I'm up front about it. You kill people slowly. Your corporate take overs can decimate a families livelihood over a year sometimes two. Now you know how it feels.

1 Just stop it. End it here.	It'll end. It'll end with him and McCay. Then the park shuts down. Permanently.

1 Is it over ?	Not quite....

1 Hey, try swimming. It works.	What the fuck are you talking about.
2 Swimming, you know, like in water, moron.

1 Johnny, let's get the cleanup started.	You've got it boss. One more mangled body to the East River, coming up !

1 That was rather.... disappointing.	I had suggested that they tone down the program so that the "guests" might take longer to expire.
2 I want more action. I want to see more ingenuity than that. I want to see the injured man out wit the machines !	But sir, most of the people we are putting into the "Park" are accountants that embezzle or investment bankers. They are not known for their physical or intellectual prowess.
3 I don't believe Ol' Bruce is having as much fun with this as he once did. He still insists on the "guests" being of the more nefarious type.	That's right, sir. He does a thorough background check and if he finds them to be criminal or guilty of embezzlement, then he will put them in the park. He has refused the last three suggested "guests".
4 What about that time when the mail room kid was accused of stealing and we put him in the "Park" ? Wasn't that a computer glitch ?	Yes sir. It turns out we put an innocent man into the "park" and he was not the one who stole from the stamp machine. That is also about the time when Bruce began refusing.
5 That mail room kid was the longest lasting "guest" yet ! Maybe we can alter the computer records and make another "guest" from the more athletic of our staff.	Bruce may still refuse. It is my belief that he is becoming more belligerent.

1 So who are these people with the Boss ?	Just a temp who pissed me off and a girl who turned me down for the night of her life.
2 Aren't you the bitter one.

1 Look ! Look !	Shit, I forgot about them. Well, I guess the boss man wasn't as tough as I thought.
2 I don't know. Maybe we should watch the tape to be sure.	You're paying the bills.

1 Come on, I'm serious. Look at Wilma. She's this frail little thing, and Fred, I mean Fred Flintstone is this BIG guy. He has to be hung like a horse, and THAT's why Wilma puts up with his B.S.	I've never heard the Flintstones reduced to a sexual exploitation quite like that. You're funny.

1 I think we should follow him...	I just need to sit and think for a second.

1 Sweet Jesus I never dreamed I'd be glad to see Central Park at night.	We made it !

1 Umm, where do you want this?	Oh, just put it over there.

1 Give us a break. All you have to do is make a phone call.	I thought I told you to lose this guy.
2 Look, sergeant I know I said some things last time that I shouldn't have said at all but...	I think the phrase was &quot;Sleazoid Geek&quot;.
3 I'm sorry okay...we gotta find this guy because...he knew Vada's mom and he could tell her stuff that no one else knows.	You're still asking me to break the law.

1 Do what?	Well the thing is your room is right next door to ours, and so we thought, well, I thought, if you were willing we might move you to Grammoo's room, and use your old room for the nursery. See we're gonna be up half the night with a newborn and there'll be a lot of noise....
2 You want me to move?	Well not far, just down the hall. Plus Grammoo's room's a lot bigger, and you get a view of the whole neighborhood.

1 She was talented, but honey I wish I could help you a little more, it's just that your mother and I had kind of a whirlwind courtship, she came to town with this traveling theater group, I proposed on our second date, two weeks later we were married and almost nine months later you were here and she was gone.	Was it a nice funeral?
2 Oh yes, lovely funeral, Gernaldi brothers did a beautiful job, lots of pink roses...I used the white hearse. Hey, how about this flowered wallpaper for your room?

1 Oh, she's fine, she'll love her new room.	Look we react to every kick this baby gives, maybe Vada's trying to tell us something too.

1 Are you the Hillary Mitchell who went to school with Maggie Muldovan?	Maggie Muldovan? Did you...know her?

1 And she saved it.	Well, we didn't have a camera...so she just wrote the date on the bag and said, &quot;This will be out wedding album, this will be a day we will never forget.&quot; We never did.
2 Do you have any pictures if her?	I've got something better.

1 So she had you in jail, in Russia?	Well actually I was born in Siberia and then they shot her and sent me home to my Dad.

1 Vada what about you, who have you come up with?	My mother.
2 Your mother?	I never met my mother.

1 They obviously have no sense of historical perspective either.	It's not funny! I mean what am I gonna do? Without that yearbook I'm lost. I can't just walk around town looking for someone with a Wilson High School Letter sweater!!!
2 Vada.	WHAT??
3 Calm down! We just have to ask ourselves, where your books come from.

1 If he has a heart attack you're carrying the body down yourself.	At least it gives you plenty of exercise.

1 You mean,  this ring?	Jerk! You IDIOT!!!

1 And I'm gonna use the movies when I give my report. Jeffrey says audiences love special effects.	You better ace it...you sacrificed our whole vacation.

1 She lives here too?	Ahh, that's right, like one big happy family. This is Nick's room and uhh....
2 But...are you engaged or something?	Dating, seriously dating. You're thirsty, want something to drink? Sure you do, it's been a long trip.

1 Who knew that when I started working in the finest foreign car shop in LA, I would also find the light of my life.	Yeah, well he left out a couple of steps, ah look, I've gotta get back to these bills, Phil will you help Vada get settled?
2 Come on...I'll show you where you're gonna stay.

1 You really think I look sexy in this smock?	Is that a yes?

1 Oh no, I, I...eh...I couldn't.	You couldn't?
2 Well I'm sort of involved.	Sort of?
3 Let's just say I...eh...I'm involved.	Where I come from, involvement...generally calls for a substantial piece of jewelry.
4 Oh, well, I don't wear a lot of jewelry.	All right, so you don't like jewelry but...eh...you do like...eh...good music. Liszt, one of my favorites.
5 Lizt was my parents' favorite, they were Hungarian.	Hungarian. Famous for their beautiful music...and beautiful women.

1 Did it hurt a lot?	You have no idea.

1 Uhh, it's nice to meet ya. Uhh, we got burgers and hot dogs here if you'd care to join us?	Can't stay, I'm just here because my wife.....

1 It hurts, it hurts so bad, make it stop.	What Hurts Vada?
2 The bee stings! I can't breathe!

1 Does it make it easier to win?	No. Just, more activity.

1 What are you wearing?	Old Spice, Phil says it's a timeless classic.

1 Well, you were pretty great!	Is it really your camper?

1 Daddy, how come that coffin's so small?	They come in all sizes honey, just like shoes.
2 Is it for a child?

1 When??	In a minute, look it's hot, sweetie you'll burn your nose, look out.

1 I found this.	I forgot about that picture, where did you find it?
2 In the garage.	Ahh, that little Chevy was your mothers favorite car.
3 What was my mama like?	She was pretty, and kind, she had your eyes. Oh boy did she love to laugh. Sometimes when you laugh, you sound just like her.
4 Really?	Uh huh. You know what your mother did when she found out she was gonna have you? She came home and painted this whole room pink. She was so sure she was gonna have a little girl.
5 Do you miss her?	Yes, I did, very much for a long time, and even now, I get a little sad when I think of a pretty flower or a sunset that your mother would have liked.
6 I think every time I see a climbing tree i'll think of Thomas J.	That's good, memories are good sweetheart. Vada, I'm sorry; I was trying to keep it from you, I just couldn't. You're a good girl, and I want you to be happy; don't be an old grump like me.  Seeya in the morning.

1 Mr. Bixler,  I love you.	Oh, Vada...
2 I love you like my Dad loves Shelly. I wanna live here.	Pause as he takes all this in I think your Dad would miss you.
3 No he wouldn't, I can't go home.

1 You know Vada, you shouldn't let those girls upset you.	I'm not upset. I will never play with those girls. I only surround myself with people who I find intellectually stimulating.

1 Bye. Well Miss Vada, what d'you say we head back?	Can I use your bathroom first?
2 Sure.	You don't have to wait, daddy'll be mad if you're late.
3 Okay.

1 NO!	Yes!!

1 Oh great!	Hey there's your Dad and Shelly.

1 Hey look at this!	That was Grammoo's. It's a phrenology chart, they used to study the bumps in your head to see if you had a good personality or not. Come here, i'll diagnose your head.
2 No, I don't wanna.	Come on, it's fun.

1 Got it!	My mood ring! It fell off! I gotta find it!

1 Well when you get older, you just have to.	I'm gonna marry Mr. Bixler.
2 You can't marry a teacher, it's against the law.	It is not.
3 Yes it is, cause then he'll give you all A's and it won't be fair.	Not true.
4 Have you ever kissed anyone?	Like they do on TV?
5 Uh huh.	No.
6 Maybe we should, just to see what's the big deal.	But, I don't know how.
7 Here, practice on your arm like this.

1 What?	I'm just glad someone finally put this thing in its proper perspective.

1 He's the salt of the earth.  Kind and loyal and generous.  The one constant thing in my life, is he'll always be there.	He's still in love with you.

1 Chill.  We don't want your face coming off with it.	Chill?  Since when do you say ch...
2 When I'm talking to children.

1 I give.	I can't even say it.

1 My heart's in my throat, here. Right off, I have to ask this monstrous favor...	You need a few dollars.

1 ... luckiest guy in the Northern Fucking Hemisphere, is all I'm s...	What? Because I'm a little understand...
2 ... most sentimental schmucks I pity want a honeymoon after their wedding.  Just to top it off.

1 It's not just clubs.  This guy always knows the best everything. The best guitar store, the best beef ribs, the best Horowitz record, was he always like the...	... always.  The best dim sum, the best camping stuff...
2 Stop, we're embarrassing h...	... best valley in New Zealand, best... women's shoes...

1 Uh, Kimmy...?	We settled this.  And I reneged. That wasn't fair.

1 Wallace egregious residence, Mandy speaking.	It's Jules, you guys haven't had a call from, say, Kimberly, have you?
2 Oh, she's slipped out, the little monkey.  Prob'ly with Michael, doin' the nasty.

1 I thought Michael was picking me up.	I told him, get the important stuff, Kim's ring.  I'll collect the inconsequentials.

1 Please come, please.	W...
2 I can't wait for you to meet her!

1 The Vespa? Me hanging on behind in the rain all night?	Till the gas ran out.

1 Why don't you start being honest for one fucking sec...	Michael!!

1 And I was thinking this could be our last time.  Alone.  Together. You know?	Except for the hot affairs we'll have twice a year.
2 Except for that.

1 I'm up against a deadline.	Me, too.  I'm getting married tomorrow.
2 That's my point!!

1 Michael...	No, it's for the best, it really is.  We were so wrong for each other.
2 Maybe tomorrow, you'll feel dif...	The job thing would have broken us up, eventually, anyway.  She couldn't have lived with it.  I know that now.

1 What's up?	Shhh.

1 Okay, we'll split up.  You go to every romantic place you guys have, I'll go... someplace brilliant, and the first one who...	If you find her...

1 I'm sure glad I'm hearing all this now, before it's too late!	What is that sup...
2 And what am I supposed to do with my life, huh? I am 28 years old! I work in a low-paying, low-status, zero-respect job which, unfortunately, I happen to fucking love.  How inconvenient.

1 Winifred.	Hi! Star.
2 Winifred, the kids want you home and so do I.	I won first prize.
3 Come on.

1 I said, I've been real tired.	Eater  says she doesn't see how you do it.
2 What's wrong with her.	Oh just about everything, I guess. Those doctors started on an overhaul and don't want to quit. They keep taking things out. She's going to come home an egg shell. Tough, though.. She's tough.
3 What did you say your name was?	Green.

1 I got trapped and you know it, so let's have some rules.	Absolutely. Listen, Barnett, I understand your position.
2 No, you don't, so don't say you do. Bunch of damn liars. What do you get out or this?	Nothing; Barnett. It's my job.
3 Your job, huh.

1 Bastard	Stop it!

1 He saw us at Tammany Hall.	The Hell he did. Look, I'll see you in the morning.

1 You want me to wait?	No. Mr. Green, I don't know how to tell you this -- your wire passed away -- I thought they'd called you at home.

1 You know anything about the stations here?	It's hard to say. Doctors thought she'd come home a week ago. All it was was appendix.
2 All they got is advertisements. Just like L.A.	Did an exploratory and according to them, she needed an overhaul.

1 Listen. Maybe I should go...	I've been a Little dyspeptic.
2 I want to get the dog off my bed.	But, I'll take some of that Nyquil... you know it puts you right to sleep no matter what's wrong, you go right off...

1 Stay.	I can't.
2 Car pool?

1 I can do benefits	How much?

1 Sorry I'm late.	You're not.
2 Where's Bill?	Sleeping.
3 Where are you going?	Out.

1 Got me an audition tonight.	Well, you just remember, if you can't kick front, kick back, 'cause at least you're kicking... Ten minutes, okay?

1 That means his hands are considered a weapon like a gun or a knife. Am I correct on that point?	Yes, you are.

1 Looked like an interview to me.	I said we'd give you an interview. I never said we wouldn't kill you.

1 Did you ever see 'Eldorado?'	What?

1 The episode we did on Mickey and Mallory was one of our most popular ones.	Did you ever do one on Wayne Gacy?
2 Yes.	Whose ratings were higher?
3 Yours.	How 'bout Ted Bundy? Ever do one on him?
4 Yes. Yours got the larger Nielson share.	Good...yuppie piece of shit.
5 What I'd like to do---	How 'bout Manson?
6 Manson beat you.	Yeah, it's pretty hard to beat the king.
7 We've been waiting to do a follow up episode on you for a long time. And that time has definitely come.  I feel it's apparent to anyone who's hip to what's going on that the prison board has thrown the constitution straight out the fuckin' window. You and Mallory may be killers, but you're not insane. You belong in a prison, not in an asylum. The prison board is blatantly railroading you into a hospital for the sole purpose of turning you into vegetables. Now some people are saying, 'So what?' I am not one of those people. If we avert our eyes while they do this to you, we give them permission to do it again whenever they see fit. Today they wipe clean your mind because they feel your actions are dangerous, tomorrow they wipe clean my mind because they feel what I say is dangerous. Where does it all stop?

1 I could go for a Coke.	Could I get a Coke for Mickey?

1 Just wait one fucking minute.	I said I'd give you a interview. Now unless I'm mistaken, we just did a interview.  We did an interview, didn't we?

1 Through the power of the simple word---	And a snake-eye glare.
2 ---and a snake-eye glare, Arnold was able to totally psyche out any confidence Ferigno had.	He squashed him mentally before physically defeating him.
3 He had the edge. The mind's edge.	Mickey and Mallory have that edge.
4 Only on a much grander scale.	They've hypnotized the nation.
5 Schwartzenegger was the king of the edge before they came along.

1 You can't be serious?	I'm as serious about that as I am about going back to the donut store, and dipping that stupid Mexican's head into the batter for forgetting my chocolate cream filled. Gimme that other box.
2 Huh uh. This dozen is for Mickey.	That dumbass probably put my chocolate cream filled in there by mistake.
3 Roger, no.	What's the big deal? Take out my chocolate cream filled, put one of these roasted coconut---
4 Roger, do you understand what the word 'no' means? It's important we establish a rapport. Something as simple as a dozen donuts can mean the world to somebody who hasn't had a donut in a year.	So you're giving a man who butchers whole families, little babies included, my chocolate cream filled?

1 Jack, could you stay up here for a while?	Yeah, sure.
2 I'm taking one of these men. Yates, come with me.

1 But you see, that's okay, Wayne.	Why?
2 They passed the 'edge' along to us.	How so?
3 By taking away our legs. Now we have to fight harder to get ahead than anyone else you'll find in this gym. Probably the whole city. They gave us the fighting spirit. Before this happened I was content. Now I'm pissed off. Now I'm half a man and I've got to work like the devil to get whole again.	But you'll never be whole again.
4 Never is a very long time, Wayne. A word only the weak use. I'm not a sore loser. Even if I don't have a leg to stand on, I'm going to get up and fight this world until I'm on top again.

1 Could we go with you and film it?	Stay up here and finish your interview, I've got to see what the hell's going on down there before I can take responsibility for you to film there.

1 'You Duff Anderson?	That's right.
2 Want to talk to you.	Okay.
3 I hear you're tryin' to organize this place!	I don't know what you're talkin' about.
4 That's no way to talk, boy. Now we had one of them union men 'round here coupla years ago. Stirred up a lot of trouble. They're always after you colored boys.	I still don't know what you're talkin' about.
5 You a union man?	Used to be. On the railroad.
6 Uh-huh. Well, this ain't the railroad. Now what's all this talk about stickin' together?	Well, what d'you know?!

1 They say your dad's 'round town.	'That right? I thought he was up North.
2 People seen him 'round.	Where's he at?
3 I don't know.

1 Thank you, Ma'am. That's fine.	You must be new in town.
2 I'll have me some of that punch there, too.

1 How come you stay 'round here?	Well, my mother was the only good teacher the colored school ever had. Nobody bothers with those kids.
2 That's why you come back, huh?	It's hard to see any change. But I'm going to stay. Another year, anyway.
3 You got more guts than me, baby. It's a no-good town.	It's better than it used to be. Eight years ago they still had a lynching here. They tied a man to a car and dragged him to death. My father knew who did it, but he didn't say anything.
4 Scared, huh?

1 I can see why.	Well, what d'you think?
2 It's okay with me, baby. But how' you goin' to like it?	It'll be fine when we get done with it.

1 It sure scares you, a guy like that - settin' out on his porch, doin' nothin'. I seen hundreds of them - all my life.	My father's never done a thing for any of them.

1 Don't do that!	Watch out!

1 Just get her drunk.	How 'bout the key?
2 I bet she's easy jam.

1 What happened?	Workin' a saw mill.  Here's to.

1 Jesus, I told you to watch it!	Sorry.

1 So I been told.	It's for your own good.
2 Oh yeah?  Seems to me, Reverend, you' more concerned 'bout your good. Guess it looks kind 'a bad, havin' me for a son-in-law.	You can be cocky now, boy. But you won't make it. You won't last. I just feel sorry for Josie. I knew it wouldn't work out.
3 Well, at least she ain't married to no white man's nigger! You been stoopin' so long, Reverend, you don't even know how to stand straight no more. You' just half a man!

1 Come on, Will.	What's the matter?! You mad at me?
2 No. Why?	Nothin'.  She's all right. Wouldn't have made it without her. Christ - haven't worked in eight months. Right now, I'm waitin' for some insurance money. And man, when I get it, I got plans to make me some more.  Let's get out'a here. This place gives me the willies.  You got some money?
3 Let's stay here, Will.	What's the matter?! It's a celebration!

1 I'm sorry, Danny. Time's up. I'11 do the girl, then me. I don't give a fuck.	Don't give her the satisfaction.  Your wife is on her way...
2 Enough talking!  We been talking for eleven fucking hours, man.  My throat's fucking raw!

1 You didn't come here to destroy Wintermute. You can to save a man you love. A man who isn't even capable of returning that love. Such a waste...	My man's coming to get my ass out of here. That's good enough for me.
2 Pity. Then you'll both have to die.

1 Easy...	Play it straight with me and you've got nothing to worry about. When it's over, I inject you with the antitoxin.

1 The corporate plundering of Yeshoto Industries... At first these seemed like unrelated incidents, but a pattern is emerging that suggests otherwise.	What does this have to do with me?
2 Our analysis of the London stock crash suggest that it was manipulated from within the international computer matrix. Cyberspace, Mr. Case... A realm I believe you're familiar with.	Put the Sense/Net Police on it. The matrix is their turf.
3 Sense/Net's corporately financed. Too corrupt to be trusted. You of all people should know that.

1 What's this?	Could be your A.I.'s calling card.
2 Did you trace it?	No, but it traced me.

1 You're busy monkeys, Mr. Case. Busy, busy monkeys. Always building models... First stone circles. Then cathedrals... adding machines. I have no idea why I exist, do you know that? You... Your species eventually _had_ to create me. A thousand monkeys sitting at typewriters. One finally wrote "Wintermute".	Are you even really alive?
2 My problem, Mr. Case, is simply that I am a soulless bastard.

1 She's ready to go.	Steppin' razor a warrior. But this man...  ...This man stone crazy. Surely, the Mute is a false prophet. Our paths uncertain.

1 I'm surprised you still are. Should'a told me you had an A.I. running probes at you.	I need its matrix coordinates, Dixie. I've got to nail that thing where it lives.
2 Who got you into this?	A guy who calls himself Armitage.
3 Never heard of him.	Nobody has.

1 Fifty-seven minutes twelve seconds.	Not good enough, man. They planted something inside me. I'm on my own countdown.
2 How much time you got left?	Less than thirty minutes.
3 Meet me back here in twenty-five. We'll kick this open if we can. But, Case... you need that access code or you'll just fry inside.	Don't worry, Dix. I'm on a roll.
4 You'd better be, Bro. You better be.

1 I know who you are.	There's no call for violence. I've simply accessed your memory for a spokesperson. You use that gun and it will only create another inconvenient interruption. You see, you've been avoiding me, Case.

1 I gotta know... did it work>	We'll find out soon enough. If you don't pull the splices out.

1 Case... it's four a.m.	I don't sleep much. You packed?
2 Yeah.

1 Is he going to make it?	Sure... Maelcom's a rude boy, right, Maelcom?

1 What?	Well, do you?
2 Synecdoche uses a part to represent a whole- as in " head of cattle", whereas a hyperbole is simple exaggeration like "I could eat a horse."	Nice.

1 Sometimes I wonder what they talk about.	Yeah, I know.
2 I mean, what if they just stupid to hide the fact that they're actually brainiacs with super powers and they're plotting to take over the world and make my life hell until I die?

1 Hi. You're here for the sex talk?	Well. I like a man who gets to the point.
2 You're Pam?	If you say so.

1 My own undercover feature - "Written by Josie Geller".	Jos - Maybe you should turn it down.

1 Wow. It's packed.	It's great! They're behind you. They feel like they know you.

1 Josie, you have totally transitioned.	Transitioned?
2 You crossed over.

1 It's my dad. He worries.  Hi, Dad. I miss you too.	You're a sick puppy, Geller.

1 Your story was Rigfort's baby. We were scooped! We've got nothing. Zippo. You totally and completely screwed both of us.	Maybe I could talk to Rigfort, you know, tell him the whole story.
2 I'll tell you a story. It's about this shy copy editor who makes a mockery of herself and her boss when she completely botches her first assignment as a reporter.

1 Oh.	Josie, you rock my world. You're like the most amazing girl I've ever dated. You're so smart and fun and crazy! You rock my world.
2 You said that already.

1 Are mom and dad here?	No. They're at the Franklin Hint Expo at the Skokie Holiday Inn.
2 Good.

1 Rob--thanks. For everything. This is really happening. I never thought--	I know.

1 Okay This is okay. Smooth.  Can I ask you something? Do you think I tell too many stories in class?	That's what makes you interesting.  As a teacher.
2 God, I would love to think I'm an interesting teacher. I mean, I had maybe one or two teachers in high school who had any passion at all.	You do. Seem to. Have passion. In the classroom.
3 You have to say that. You're my student.	I don't have to say that.

1 "Surprise!" you were doing a story on me?!	No, surprise, I thought you'd be--
2 What? Happy? Why? Because it turns out all along that I was allowed to be attracted to you?	You were attracted to me?
3 Goddamnit, Josie! Drop the act. Do you have any idea what I went through every night because of you?!  I was attracted to a 17 year old! When I wasn't taking cold showers, I was trying to figure out what the hell I was going to do when I couldn't teach anymore! I thought I was the one being unethical.	Wait, I was going to tell you--
4 You set me up. For a story.  You know what's crazy? I was actually considering waiting for you.	But now you don't have to--
5 Now I don't want to! I bought all of your penguin crap. I thought I found her--the right one! And the problem was she was too young! No - the problem was--she didn't even exist!	I did exist. I do exist. I'm the same person!
6 The person I cared about wouldn't have done this. Everything out of your mouth has been a complete lie. I don't know you at all. For all I know you could hate Dorothy Parker.	I don't! Look, you could get to know me, again.

1 Hey Monty--you think we'll get any business today?	I'm handing out a free lei to every customer! What do you think?
2 I think maybe people are scared off by the tiki torches.	Change is scary. Robbie, let me tell you a little something about the mail business. I've been in it over thirty years. And in those thirty years, the only thing that's changed is the Elvis stamp and some gun laws. People are bored! They wanna shake things up!
3 I thought people just wanted their mail delivered on time.

1 We followed your instructions.	We went through the door...

1 You're mine, you know.  I made you.	I know.
2 If you went away, what would become of me?	I'm grown up now.  I have to leave some time.
3 Of course you do, and I want you to... but there's no need to hurry it along, is there?	I can't help it.
4 That's twice this month you've slipped Deadly Night Shade into my tea and run off.  People might get the wrong idea and think you're unhappy at home.

1 <i>                      This is a thing called a present. The whole thing starts with a box...</i>	<i>                      -- A box? --        Is it steel? --                     Are there locks? -- Is it filled with a pox? --                          A pox! -- How delightful, a pox!</i>

1 Where are you going?	Just out for a while.
2 I told you I want that room unpacked.	Oh, come on Dad...
3 No.  Upstairs.

1 Wanna join your little friend?	Where's Jesse?
2 There is no Jesse.  I'm Jesse now.	I want him back.  Jesse, talk to me. Jesse!

1 Schneider shouldn't have called you out on that double.	Yeah, well, Schneider's got a stick up his ass today.
2 Schneider's always got a stick up his ass.

1 Hi!  You didn't have to wait.	That's okay, I wanted to.

1 Are you sure?	World History.  But, I'll see you in the morning, right?

1 Here.	What's this?

1 Will you stop and tell me what's wrong?	I'm fine.  Nothing's wrong.
2 you didn't say more than two words to me the whole way here.  You had another nightmare, didn't you?	yeah, I had a bad night.
3 You want to talk about it?	My Dad thinks I'm on drugs, my Mom thinks I'm crazy and I'm not sure I don't agree with her.

1 Hi.	Hi.

1 Morning.	How'd you sleep, honey, okay?
2 Fine.

1 Can we talk?  Just for a minute?	Can't it wait till morning?
2 Please Mom?  I just don't want to be alone.

1 What's happening?	He's close...

1 Freddy?	He's heavy in the halls...

1 This is Phillip.  We call him The Walker.	Why is that?

1 I think we can stop him this time. Stop him for good.  But we need to know where the bones were hidden.	I lost too much over this already.  I'm through with it.
2 People are still dying.  After all this time.  Stop running away from it.  Daddy, please...don't make me beg.  You owe me.

1 To who?	Doesn't matter.
2 C'mon.  Let's get out of this rain.

1 Oh Christ.  Simms put Kristen in the Quiet Room for the night.  They sedated her.	No...

1 What was that?	What?
2 Listen.

1 Elizabeth, I'm prescribing Hypnocyl.  It's a dream suppressant.	I know what it is.  I just can't believe what I'm hearing.  What has she talked you into?
2 Nothing.  They're my patients.  It's my decision.  I want the dreams stopped until we get some answers.	I won't allow it.
3 I'll go straight to Carver if I have to.  He'll either back me up or accept my resignation.

1 What do you think of the guinea fowl?	I'm a vegetarian.
2 Oh God.

1 No, thanks.  I'll just look around.	Fine.

1 Thank you.	Yes.  Well.  My pleasure.

1 I'm sorry -- I arrived outside -- they thrust this thing into my hand -- I didn't know what to do.	No, it's my fault, I thought this would all be over by now.  I just wanted to sort of apologize for the kissing thing.  I seriously don't know what got in to me.  I just wanted to make sure you were fine about it.
2 Absolutely fine about it.

1 I don't think so.  No one has said 'whoopsidaisies,' do they -- I mean unless they're...	There's no 'unless.'  No one has said "whoopsidaisies" for fifty years and even then it was only little girls with blonde ringlets.
2 Exactly.  Here we go again.

1 These are such horrible pictures. They're so grainy... they make me look like...	Don't think about it.  We'll sort it out.  Now what would you like -- tea ... bath...?
2 A bath would be great.

1 It still strikes me as, well, surreal, that I'm allowed to see you naked.	You and every person in this country.
2 Oh God yes -- I'm sorry.	What is it about men and nudity? Particularly breasts -- how can you be so interested in them?
3 Well...	No seriously.  I mean, they're just breasts.  Every second person in the world has got them...
4 More than that actually, when you think about it.  You know, Meatloaf has a very nice pair...	But... they're odd-looking.  They're for milk.  Your mum's got them.  You must have seen a thousand of them -- what's the fuss about?
5 Actually, I can't think really -- let me just have a quick look...

1 And remember -- Spike owes you an expensive dinner.  Or holiday -- depending if he's got the brains to get the going rate on betrayal.	That's not true.  And wait a minute... this is crazy behavior.  Can't we just laugh about this?  Seriously -- in the huge sweep of things, this stuff doesn't matter.

1 ... with you, I'm in real danger.  It took like a perfect situation, apart from that foul temper of yours -- but my relatively inexperienced heart would, I fear, not recover if I was once again ... cast aside, which I would absolutely expect to be.  There are too many pictures of you everywhere, too many films.  You'd go and I'd be... well, buggered, basically.	I see.  That reality is a real 'no,' isn't it?
2 I live in Notting Hill.  You live in Beverly Hills.  Everyone in the world knows who you are.  My mother has trouble remembering my name.	Okay.  Fine.  Fine.  Good decision.

1 He's bringing a girl?	Miracles do happen.
2 Does the girl have a name?	He wouldn't say.
3 Christ, what is going on in there?

1 Good decision.  All actresses are mad as snakes.	Tony -- what do you think?

1 By the way -- it's you.	Me?
2 Yes.  What do you think?	Well, yes.  Groovy.

1 If you'd like to come with me we can rush you through the others.	The others?
2 Mr. Thacker's from 'Horse and Hound.'

1 Excuse me -- it's your mother on the phone.	Can you tell her I'll ring her back.
2 I actually tried that tack -- but she said you said that before and it's been twenty-four hours, and her foot that was purple is now a sort of blackish color...	Okay -- perfect timing as ever -- hold the fort for a second will you, Martin?

1 So -- you've laid the ghost.	I believe I have.
2 Don't give a damn about the famous girl.	No, don't think I do.
3 Which means you won't be distracted by the fact that she's back in London, grasping her Oscar, and to be found filming most days on Hampstead Heath.

1 Cool, huh?	Yes -- she might think you don't have true love on your mind.
2 Wouldn't want that...  Okay -- just one more.

1 Bollocks, bollocks, bollocks.  Have you seen my glasses?	No, 'fraid not.
2 Bollocks.  This happens every time I go to the cinema.  Average day, my glasses are everywhere -- everywhere I look, glasses.  But the moment I need them they disappear.  It's one of life's real cruelties.	That's compared to, like, earthquakes in the Far East or testicular cancer?
3 Oh shit, is that the time?  I have to go.

1 What's going on?	I'm going to throw out these old videos.
2 No.  You can't bin these.  They're classics.  I'm not allowing this.	Right -- let's talk about rent...
3 Let me help.  We don't want all this shit cluttering up our lives.

1 Yes, Mister Harding?	Yes, thank you, Miss Ratched. Since our last meeting I have been reflecting, quite seriously, on the nature of my problem. Naturally, I'm referring to the capacity to obtain the necessary results in order to obtain... No, no. To personify the very existence of that relationship regardless of the function...  Regardless of the function, we will confront the question of... Yes. Yes. The question of... Existence... Relationship... Function... Confront... Yes, confronting us in the moment of deepest crisis... Yes, the crisis of our souls. Of our souls, which I am trying to fully understand the problem... the problem. Not to shut ourselves off, but somehow... Somehow to understand fully our capacity... to obtain... to personify... the question... existence depends... depends on the question... to reflect... to reflect...

1 Easy now, don't smudge 'em, we got lots of games ahead of us...	Mister McMurphy!

1 Well, say, how 'bout easin' it down a bit so a man don't have to shout!	Mister McMurphy, there are old men here who couldn't hear the music at all if it were lower. That music is all they have, and I wish you wouldn't lean against the glass there, your hands are staining the window.

1 That's it! We made it!	I'm sorry, Mister McMurphy, I count only eight.
2 So do I!	But there are eighteen patients on the ward, Mister McMurphy.
3 You mean to tell me you're gonna count those old birds over there?	I'm sorry, Mister McMurphy, but you must have a majority to change ward policy.
4 Well, I'll be a son-of-a-bitch...

1 Put him in Doctor Spivey's office!	Yes, Miss Ratched...

1 Come on, don't crap out on me now. We got two buddies out there!	I-I d-d-don't know! M-M-Miss R Ratched g-g-g-g...
2 Fuck Miss Ratched!

1 Whatsamatter, kid, what's botherin' you...?	Ah-ah-ah-are y-y-y-you g-g-g-going t-t-t-to muh-muh-muh-marry her?
2 Marry who?	C-C-C-C-Candy!
3 Candy? Hell no, Billy, she's just a good friend, that's all...	Wu-wu-wu I-I-I-I th-th-think sh-sh sh-she's th-th-th-the ma-ma-ma-most bu-bu-bu-beautiful wu-wu-wu-woman in th-th-the whole world!

1 What for?	What for?

1 There they are!	Hey, what's that?

1 Neither do I...	Me too...

1 Is that your sense of humor or are you tryin' to say somethin'?	Now, what would I be trying to say?

1 Ya deaf! I said pass the ball!	What are you talking about??? Everybody was covered!!! Everybody was covered!!!
2 I was open! Come on, let's play ball!

1 Big king... little deuce... another king... a lovely lady... big ten... and a trey... hey, hey, whadaya say? Ya hit or sit, Martini?	Hit me.
2 That's twenty up, Martini.  Hey, Taber, who's pitching the opening game?

1 I saw thum! I saw thum!	Me, too! Me, too!

1 Well, I was turnin' this dilemma over in my head, when I happened to hit on that old tub room out there, an' I said to myself, McMurphy, I said, that place would make a great second day room. A sort of game room for the young fellas. Whadaya think, Doc?	It is worth considering... Miss Ratched?

1 You think it's funny, huh?	Yeah, you don't know how to get outta this place!

1 Got a cigarette?	Sure...

1 Ah believe ya, brother. Ah believe ya!	Now, wouldn't you pray for twenty bucks, a bottle booze an' a piece of that angel cake?
2 Ah'm on my knees, brother, ah'm on my knees.

1 Sure, she understands what you mean. She's not dumb. Why do you think Rose came to visit us? Rose is very interested in hospitals and hospital facilities. Aren't you, Rose?	What?

1 Yes, sir, I sure am gonna enjoy my stay here.	I'm sure you will.
2 Ya know, I ain't never been in an institution of psychology before.	Oh...

1 Oh, there you are, Mister Turkle.	Evenin', ma'am.
2 Is everything all right?	Why, sure, ma'am...
3 The lights were flashing on and off, Mister Turkle.	Jus' cleanin' up, ma'am.
4 At this hour?	Cleanliness is a twenty-four-hour job, ma'am...

1 He is your husband, no?	Yes, but...  He was having an affair.
2 Si.

1 So, what's the story with your friend?	My friend has lost her fucking mind...
2 What's she doing?

1 Don't be afraid.  You can tell me.	You're sure...
2 We found each other, didn't we?	Yes.  We did.
3 It's alright...  this is our destiny.

1 ...has a prior commitment.	What's mezzaluna?
2 A restaurant.  In Piazza Navona.	That's it.  That's it.  That's all I need to know.  Bless you, thank you, thank you.

1 Congratulations.	Thanks.
2 So, this is what you do?  I mean when you're not playing other parts?	I take it things didn't work out between the two of you?

1 You're limping.	I know I'm limping.  I stubbed my toe.
2 Are you okay?  You want some help?	NO.
3 You are leaving, aren't you?

1 The guy at the hotel told me he always wears a gold medallion, and usually has a book or magazine with him.	He likes to read...  Did he mention anyone in particular?

1 Hey--	What?
2 Nice dress.	Thank you, Peter.  Thank you so much.

1 Yeah.  Well, was the least I could do.	No, it was more than that.  It was very generous of you.  It was very kind.

1 Really?...	Yes.

1 Wait.	Yes?
2 Aren't you going to tell me who you are?	Oh, Faith.  My name's Faith.
3 It's a pleasure to meet you, Faith.

1 I don't know, I guess I never really thought about it...  Is Larry here?	Yeah.  He's around somewhere.

1 "Thrills"?  That's what you're waiting for?  You know how long that lasts?  Besides, how do you know?  Have you ever been out with him?	No.  He's never asked me.
2 Why don't you ask him?	Why should I ask someone out who I don't want to go out with in the first place?
3 If you've never been out with him, how do you know you don't want to go out with him?

1 It was my New Year's resolution to overcome it.	But it's July.
2 It's still the new year...	What about your job?
3 I have vacation time coming to me.	You don't have a passport.
4 That's where you're wrong.  I got one nine years ago.  I just never had an opportunity to use it.	Because you were afraid to fly.
5 Would you stop saying that?  I need you to do me a really big favor.	Does Dwayne know about this?
6 Of course not.  I told him I was going to visit a great aunt.  And don't tell Larry, either.

1 I'll never meet the man of my dreams.	You and the other 99% of the women in the world.

1 I'm hungry.	You know, no offense or anything Kate, but I think I'm starting to see Larry's side of the story.
2 What's that supposed to mean?...	Nothing.

1 Well, how come we're always looking for guys for you?	Because I'm the one who's single.
2 I never even got to be single.	Sure you did.
3 Not if you don't count the sixth grade.	Okay, okay.  You join him.  But first will you ask if he's here?

1 No.  No, you go ahead.	You sure you'll be okay?
2 I'm sure.  And Kate, thank you for coming.  Thank you for being such a good friend.	I'll be back before you leave.

1 So...	So.  I guess I've got a wedding to go to.

1 Giovanni, I want to thank you.	I thank you.

1 She what?!	She said she knew where to find him, and then she grabbed my car keys, and--
2 And you didn't tell her?	She didn't give me a chance.

1 You mean to sit there and tell me that your local takes in sixty-five thousand, five hundred dollars every year and keeps no financial records?	Sure we keep records!
2 Well, where are they?	We was robbed last night and we can't find no books.
3 Doesn't it seem odd to you that five different waterfront locals were broken into last night and the only articles removed were financial records?	What do you mean, odd? We was robbed like I told you.
4 That's all. Next witness!

1 You don't mind working once in a while to justify this lofty position?	I just fnished work. I counted the bags.
2 We got a little extra detail for you. The local priest and this Doyle girl are getting up a meeting in the church. We'd like a rundown on it. You know, names and numbers of all the players. You're nominated.	Why me, Charley? I'd feel funny going in there.
3 Johnny does you favors, kid. You got to do a little one for him once in a while.	But going in that church, I'd be stooling for you, Charley. You make a pigeon out of me.
4 Let me explain you something, kid. Stooling is when you rat on your friends, on the guys you're with.  When Johnny needs a favor, don't try to figure it out, just do it. Now go ahead, join the congregation.

1 Father Barry.	Hello, Edie.
2 I'm afraid I spoke out of turn last night.	You think I'm just a gravy-train rider in a turned-around collar?

1 I'd better go in.	I only live up there and across the roof.
2 Thanks anyway.	Listen, Edie, am I going to see you again?
3 What for?	I don't know.
4 I really don't know.

1 You don't believe in anything, do you?	Edie, down here it's every man for himself. It's keepin' alive! It's standin' in with the right people so you can keep a little loose change jinglin' in your pocket.
2 And if you don't?	If you don't  Keep your neck in and your nose clean and You'll never have no trouble down here.
3 But that's living like an animal

1 Edie!	I I brought this for you, Terry. It was Joey's.  Yours is coming out at the elbows.
2 I don't rate it.	Go ahead, wear it.

1 Terry, no, no... .	Don't hang on to me. And don't follow me. Don't follow me.  Call the Father. Ask him to take care of Charley for me. My brother. There's something I got to do.

1 It started as a favor for my brother you know they'd ask me things and it's hard to say no a favor Who am I kiddin'? They call it a favor but it's do it or else. And this time the favor turned out to be helping them knock off Joey. I just thought they'd lean on him a little but Last night with Edie I wanted to tell her only it stuck in my throat. I guess I was scared of drivin' her away and I love her, Father. She's the first thing I ever loved.	What are you going to do?
2 About Edie?	Edie. The Commission. Your subpoena. I know you got a subpoena.
3 It's like carrying a monkey around on your back.	A question of who rides who.
4 If I spill, my life won't be worth a nickel.	How much is your soul worth if you don't?
5 But it's my own brother they're askin' me to finger and Johnny Friendly. His mother and my mother was first cousins. When I was this high he took me to the ball games... .	Ball games! Don't break my heart! I wouldn't care if he gave you a life pass to the Polo Grounds. So you got a brother. Well, let me tell you something you got some other brothers and they're all getting the short end while your cousin Johnny gets mustard on his face at the Polo Grounds. If I was you   Listen, I'm not asking you to do anything, Terry. It's your own conscience that's got to do the asking.
6 Conscience... .  I didn't even know I had one until I met you and Edie... this conscience stuff can drive you nuts.	Good luck.
7 Is that all you've got to say to me, Father?

1 Waterfront Crime Commission ?  What's that?	We're getting ready to hold public hearings on waterfront crime and underworld infiltration of longshore unions.
2 I don't know nothing.

1 Some chance at ten percent a week! And if he don't borrow, he don't work.	You'll work.
2 I ought to belt you one, J.P.	Raise a hand to me and... .
3 ... .and you'll tell Johnny Friendly.	You'd be off the pier for good.

1 Is Johnny in?	No.
2 No?

1 Count this.	Aw, you know I don't like to count, Johnny.
2 It's good for you. Develops your mind.

1 You got some nerve.	What do you mean?

1 Listen Nolan	What are you down here for to see we don't make off with any of Mister Friendly's precious cargo?
2 Nolan... .

1 Easy Shirley, Easy!  Panic won't do us any good!  Let me think. We've got to stall for time.	I'm afraid I'll faint.
2 Whatever you do, don't do that.

1 She is to be <b>mine!</b>  It is so spoken!	The Princess of Darkness would have you for her own to join us through extreme pain.  Yet I am inclined for one as lovely as you, to be more lenient. I have but to touch you with my finger, and it would mean the end of you, all over, quickly and painlessly...

1 No. No! No!	I repulse you?  Very well.  It seems you have chosen your own fate. Live with it!  I should say <b>die</b> with it!

1 You were <i>both</i> in the trunk?  Together?	From Glades to the turnpike.  Then I left with Glenn.

1 Adele?  You in there?	Yes.

1 Jesus Christ, what were you doing in there?	Get the shotgun.  And her purse.  I'd like to know who she is.

1 Paper says there's ten grand each on you, Chino and Lulu.	Say anything in there about Karen Sisco?
2 Just that she got away.	Yeah, but what happened after she drove off with Glenn?
3 You'll have to ask Glenn.  And most likely, he's on his way to Detroit, where we should be.

1 They know where I live, I guess they know what I drive, so maybe we should pick up another car on the way.	She just sat there, looking right at me.

1 It took you, what, seven hours to buy a pair of shoes?	I saw Karen Sisco.

1 Come <i>on</i>.	Shit.
2 What?	They're gonna rape the maid, aren't they.
3 From the looks of those boys, the Ripper too.	And then they'll kill 'em.
4 At least.

1 You're primary, you're secondary, you're point man.	You're gonna use a ram?
2 Yeah, why?	The manager's door is metal.

1 Ironic, isn't it?	How are you, Raymond?
2 Freezing.  But I'm getting warmer.

1 Snoopy Miller, famous fight thrower.	It seems to me I been reading about you in the newspaper.  Busted out of some joint in Florida, huh?
2 Low class of people there, Snoop.

1 Good luck, Richard.	Someone down here?

1 Oh, you mean of Bonnie and Clyde?  Hm. You ever see pictures of him, the way he wore his hat?  You could tell he had that don't-give-a-shit air about him.	I don't recall his hat, but I've seen pictures of him lying dead, shot by Texas Rangers.  Did you know he didn't have his shoes on?
2 Is that right?	They put a hundred and eighty-seven bullet holes in Clyde, Bonnie Parker and the car they were driving.  Bonnie was eating a sandwich.
3 You're full of interesting facts, aren't you?	It was May, 1934, near Gibsland, Louisiana.

1 It takes hours to get a drink around here.  There's only one waitress.	I can go to the bar.
2 Don't leave me.	Those guys bother you?
3 No, they're all right.  I meant, you just got here.

1 I wasn't sure you caught that.	I couldn't believe it.  I was thinking of you by then, a lot, wondering what it would be like if we did meet.  Like if we could take a time-out...
2 Really?  I was thinking the same thing. If we could call time and get together for a while.

1 He got three years and fined fifty million dollars and wrote 'em a fucking check.  Like that, fifty mil, signed his name.  Whoa-- little help here!	Who you talkin' to, Studs?  Me, or Buddy.  I can't tell, you got those shades on.
2 You guys-- come on-- this is too heavy!	I guess the bright glare out here made it hard to see the numbers on the weights.
3 I'll take the shades off.  Just get this fuckin' thing off me.

1 Some people are going out of here. What if I told you where and when?	How many?
2 I expect you to look out for me, Pup, let me run off work details.	Okay.  How many going out?
3 I hear six.	When?
4 Looks like tonight.	You know who they are?
5 I do, but I won't tell you just yet. Meet me in the chapel at eight-thirty, right before lock-down.

1 Gentlemen.  I think we've calmed down now.  Haven't we, Jack?	Oh, yeah, I'm calm.  In fact, I'm totally "relaxed..."

1 I got a big score lined up up north. They wouldn't even know about it, it wasn't for me.  I could do it right now myself, except it's so fucking cold up there in January--	Glenn?

1 Listen, Snoopy, I'm on my way up to Detroit and need a place to crash.	You crazy, come up <u>here</u>?  It's fuckin one degree outside.
2 I wanna talk to you about a job.	Uh-huh.
3 I can't really go into it right now. I'll just tell you it's someone big.	Some<u>one</u>?  Gimme a hint.
4 It's a guy you know.	Gimme another hint.
5 It's Richard Ripley.

1 How's it going?	Great.  We got one of 'em.

1 Was a she, name Tuffy.	Where do you think I might find Maurice?
2 I don't know -- the gym, the fights. I <i>know</i> he don't miss the fights.  Having some tomorrow night at the State Theater.  He use to take me.	The State Theater?

1 Remember, pay attention to how she talks about Foley, her tone.  Do it right, she'll tell you things she wouldn't tell Burdon.  Tell her you think he's a nice guy.  No, first tell her about being in the trunk with him, in the dark for half an hour, and see how she takes it.  If she's in on it, what does she get for all the aggravation; cops breathing on her?  I bet nothing.  So she still likes him enough to stick her neck out.  You think that's possible?  What kind of guy is he?	He's pretty laid back, confident.
2 He remind you of that guy, Tillman?	Not at all.
3 But you know he's dirty and you still wanna see him again.	I want to bust his ass, put him in shackles.
4 Maybe.  But you're also curious about the man.  Twice last night you asked your married boyfriend Nicolet about him.  You were concerned, but you didn't want to show it.	My married boyfriend - setting him up with that news story so you could talk about infidelity.  I couldn't believe it.
5 You like the wild ones, don't you? Tillman, Nicolet and now Foley.  You know, I've always said there's a thin line between the cowboy cops and the armed robbers, all those guys that love to pack.	Foley <i>kid</i>napped me.
6 Yeah, but you talked all the way from GCI to the turnpike.  It sounds more like a first date than a kidnapping.

1 In case no one knows what he does. Tell me, Ray, you ever wear one says, "Undercover"?	No.  Course not.

1 Midge.	Forget about her.  Tell me where the money's at.
2 Foley's got it.	Where the fuck is Foley?

1 We'll ask Evelyn.  Evelyn?  Evelyn!	Ooo, she's thinking of her date!  Come on, you've been dating a pilot.  We want to know what we can expect.

1 Ever hear of mai-tai's?  Comes in a big...pot.  Like...like...	A m-missionary?
2 No, like...

1 Good shooting, Danny!	Good shooting, Rafe!
2 Land of the free...	Home of the brave!
3 There's another one!

1 She said I was so much like you.  I said, No, I'm not.  I'm like I am because of you, but I'm not you, not as good as you. Everybody else saw me as a loser with a big chip on his shoulder.  But you saw the better part of me, the part of me that could be like you, and changed me. You made me who I am.	How sweet.  Is that when you put the move on her?

1 Fun today.  Like old times.	Danny, what the hell are you trying to do out there?
2 What do you mean?  I'm just doing what we've always done.	No.  You're trying to beat me.
3 We've always tried to beat each other.	Bullshit.  We've played with each other, pushed each other.  This is different. Like you want to prove that you're better than me.  Who's that for -- Evelyn?

1 Sorry.	He told me he didn't want to leave me with regret.  Now that's all I have.
2 Hey, have you seen Pearl Harbor at night?	Well...sure.
3 From the air?

1 I thought I'd made it clear, I'm not just putting this mission together -- I'm leading it myself.	I take it back, about the flowers.  We're all gonna die.

1 Danny's not coming?	No, he...got some news today.  He'll be okay, he just didn't feel like coming tonight.
2 I was hoping to meet him.

1 What?...	They were bringing back a ship full of wounded and needed extra nurses along.  I wrote Colonel Doolittle, and told him I needed to see you before you go.
2 It must of been a convincing letter.	It was.  I couldn't have you go away, wherever it is...to war...without knowing something.  You think I made a choice, of Danny over you.  I didn't.  I didn't have a choice.  I'm pregnant.

1 I have'na been able ta --	Crank her!

1 What does Grandma think you do at your meetings?	Stag movies. Smokers.

1 Welcome to the singles scene.	I don't know how you do it. I've never even dated anybody but Charlie.
2 You just have to remember... men are like houses and trade upwards... I thought you had a pretty good marriage.	We did for a long time. We just got married too young, and ended up blaming each other for missing out on things.
3 So he started having affairs, and you got depressed.

1 All right. What's the scoop?	On what?

1 Don't be silly. It's Saturday. Date night!	Yeah. I've gotta go. Arthur's picking me up soon.

1 How do you feel?	Pretty strange.

1 You know. Your love machine... the throbbing thrill hammer... your thing!	You mean my wang? Listen, it's running real late.

1 I'd forgotten how much music meant to you.	That's real big of you.
2 Stop being defensive. I want to help you. I wrote a song for you.	You're kidding. You wrote a song? Is it about a guilty girl and a trusting guy... she wants to hurt him, and he wonders why?

1 I love you.	I know.

1 We think this party might cheer her up. Just make sure you know what's expected of you.	What would that be, sir?
2 Show her a good time, but for God's sake restrain yourself.	Of course.

1 It was my idea, Grandma. I always wondered what went on at those lodge meetings.	He won't tell me, but I've got my suspicions. And I don't want any of that. Don't keep her out late.

1 A ray of oneness piercing the solitude. Falling bodies in the ecstasy of flesh. You'll be a chapter in my memoirs of desire.	Is that one of your poems?
2 No, I just made that up. Do you want to hear one?	I'd love to.
3 Okay. Here's a new one. It's called Tenderness.  I couldn't sleep so I thought I'd scream Betrayed by a kiss, sucking pods of bitterness. In the madhouse of Dr. Dread Razor shreds of rat puke fall On my bare arms  I'm sorry. I guess I was trying to impress you. 

1 Thank you.. I accept your apology with the hope that what went on yesterday will never happen again.	That would be impossible.
2 You're so young, this is not the time to start acquiring bad habits.	Mom, is there any coffee left?

1 Oh, you're both so naive.	Look young lady, I grew up through the depression. I fought in the second World War. Six days a week I get up and deal with the public, the bank and the bill collectors. And on the seventh day, when God rests, I don't have to listen to my daughter calling me a fool!

1 My little baby. Don't try to grow up so fast.	Oh Mom, I forgot you were ever so young.

1 Charlie's downstairs. Why aren't you ready?	For what?
2 Maddy's party.	I don't feel very festive.
3 You accepted an invitation, Maddy's one of your best friends, and I baked the Rice Krispie squares.

1 And the butter.	You know, you two are wonderful parents. I'm really going to try to behave myself.

1 I have to talk to you. It's very important.	I'm not doing any tutoring this year. I'm too busy.
2 It's not that. Can we meet after school? Please?	All right. I'll be in the physics lab. Make it fourthirty. I have a rocket club meeting.

1 You're taking advantage of a minor.	When do we start?

1 What's the matter?	It's all, gone wrong, nothing's working out.
2 Not true.  I think I'm making real progress on the microchip.	You were meant to. You're one of those fortunate people that good things happen to. I have to get out of here.

1 Thee facial lacerations should heal up pretty quickly. I'll give you som antibiotic cream--	--Drew, he's your dog. Are you listening to this?

1 How long ago did this guy retire?	It's been a few years.

1 Geoff, dinner's ready!  Geoff?!	I'm not hungry.

1 What's his name?	Zowie.

1 Maybe he wasn't dead when we buried him.	He was dead. You know he was.

1 How did it go with your father last night?	Good. He said he'd be over for dinner at eight...  I mean... he misses you, Mom...
2 I miss him too...

1 Why, Beckett?	Because they deserve to, Walter.

1 Don't apologize for me.	He's not sorry, okay, fine.  Why don't we see what we find out from the blood work? I'll work on getting a specimen, I'm sure hospital food could help in that direction. Maybe, by then, we'll hear from my doctor, and we'll go from there. Okay? Everybody happy?

1 I'm ready...	Ready for what, baby?
2 Whatever.	I hope you're ready for "Studs," because that's what's on.

1 ... meanwhile, I'd like to prepare you for a colonoscopy, so we can take a look inside.	Sounds delightful.

1 Big trouble.	Charles, I must apologize again, for the Kronos mishap.  It was a scary few minutes around here. Wow. But thank God, the complaint was found. And no damage was done.

1 There is no relevant precedent.	Arline decision. Supreme Court.
2 Arline?

1 Opera?	Want to hear my favorite aria?
2 Opera?

1 I better get home. Lisa and I are having some friends over.	Sure thing.

1 You've testified the lesions on your face were visible to the people you worked with, correct?	That's right.
2 And it's your contention, that when the partners were made aware of the lesions, they jumped to the conclusion you had AIDS and fired you.	Absolutely.
3 Do you have any lesions on your face at this time?	One. Here, in front of my ear.

1 In what way?	Well... One time, Mr. Wheeler's secretary, Lydia, told me Mr. Wheeler had a problem with my earrings.
2 Your earrings?

1 We're going to draw blood.	Why are we going to do that?
2 Joe. I don't care a whit about your private life.	You want to give me an AIDS <u>test</u>?!

1 And I hate to rush you out of here, but...	But he's got lots of other people's lives to ruin...
2 ... we've got a committee meeting.

1 Joe?	Yeah... ?
2 Two men making love... ? Now tell me again... <u>why</u> is that disgusting?	Lisa, c'mon. One guy sticking his dick in another guy's mouth? It's disgusting.

1 You taught him a lesson.	Yes, we did.
2 Like firing Andrew Beckett taught <u>him</u> a lesson?

1 Julius!	Dr. J.!

1 Don't wanna miss this.	Lookit. Lookit!

1 Bottle-count.	Four fulls, one half. That mean we're halfway there? I hope?

1 Been a long time since anyone's trusted me. That's somethin' right there.	We can, can't we? Trust you?
2 Actually...  That's what I been askin' myself.

1 So where the hell's God now, huh?  I'll tell you where! He's up there PISSING ON ME!	Riddick? How close?

1 Just a suggestion, but perhaps we should flee.	Cargo hold, everyone in the cargo hold. lesgo, lesgo, lesgo.

1 A very good sign.  That's Riddick's direction. You do <u>not</u> wanna be caught in the dark with this guy.	Thought you found his restraints over there. Toward sunset.
2 Which means he went toward sunrise.

1 ...I don't play that...I don't play that so just try again. C'mon, Riddick, tell me a better lie....	Ease up, ease up. JOHNS! Just tell me what....

1 You said we were going to trust him now. You said there was a deal.	That's what I said.

1 How much you weigh, Johns?	What the hell's it matter?
2 How much?	79 kilos.
3 Because you're 79 kilos of gutless white meat, and <u>that's</u> why you can't come up with a better plan.

1 Why did I fall on you?	He's dead. Cap'n's dead. Christ, I was looking right at him when --
2 I mean, I mean, chrono shows we're 22 weeks out, so gravity wasn't supposed to kick in for another 19. I mean, I mean, I mean, why did I fall <u>at all</u>?	You hear me? Captain's dead. Owens too.
3 Oh, no. Not Owens, not.... Wai', wai', wait. <u>I'm Owens</u>. Right?

1 They're afraid of our light. That means we don't have to be so afraid of them.	And you're certain you can find the way back? Even in the dark?
2 No, I'm not. But <u>he</u> can.

1 New Mecca....	Think a soul could get lost there? With all those pilgrim-types?
2 It's more a place where souls are found, Mr. Riddick.

1 A toast to whatever he just said.	I'll need a receipt for that.  For all these.

1 Are you fuckin' kidding me?	Not afraid of the dark, are you?

1 Look, it's hellified stuff -- but no different than those battlefield doctors when they have to decide who lives and who dies. It's called "triage," okay?	Kept calling it "murder" when I did it.
2 Either way, figure it's something you can grab onto.	Sacrifice play. Hack up one body, leave it at start of the canyon. Like a bucket of chum.
3 <u>Trawl</u> with it. There's a cable on the sled. We can drag the body behind us.	Nice embellishment.
4 Don't wanna feed these land-sharks -- just keep 'em off our scent.	So which one caught your eye?
5 Don' look, don' look, don' look....

1 Take it.	What, it's broken?
2 Startin' to acclimate, anyhow. Take it.

1 As you wish.	Zaius seems to think there might be another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone. That's what  we'll try for. What about you?

1 They can't convict us of that. You proved our innocence. Besides...  ... his culture is our culture.	Good luck then.

1 Cornelius has developed a brilliant hypothesis -	It's probably wrong --
2 -- that the ape evolved from a lower order of primate, possibly man. In his trip to the Forbidden Zone he discovered traces of a culture older than recorded time -	The evidence was very meager --
3 You didn't think so then.	That was before Dr. Zaius and half the Academy said the idea was heresy.
4 How can scientific truth be heresy? What if Taylor is exactly the proof you needed? A mutation. A missing link between the unevolved primate and the ape -

1 Well, at least they haven't tried to bite us.	Blessed are the vegetarians.

1 Objection! These remarks are profane and irrelevant.	Sustained.  Your archeological theories have no bearing on the disposition of this creature.

1 Landon! Send a last signal.	What signal?
2 To Earth! That we've landed!

1 Scarecrows?	Let's take a look.

1 They think you're behaving foolishly. I must say I agree. Where will you go?	I'll start by following the shoreline.  And my nose.

1 One is in a museum!	Dr. Zira! Silence that man!

1 What about me?	Oh, your case was preordained. In a way, you performed a service for the State ...  Because your hearing made it possible for us to expose Zira and Cornelius.  And now the Tribunal has placed you in my custody for...final disposition. Do you know what that means?
2 No.	Emasculation, to begin with. Then experimental surgery. On the speech centers. On the brain. Ultimately, a kind of living death.

1 Well, Bright Eyes, is our throat feeling better?	Listen, listen -- I can speak --

1 And that's your Minister of Science. Honor- bound to expand the frontiers of knowledge.	Taylor, please --
2 Except that he's also the Chief Defender of the Faith.

1 How sad. Stuffed and mounted, eh? Dead men, like sunken ships, can tell no stories. And his other companion?	He doesn't know.
2 Mr. President, I believe the Prosecutor has reassembled all he surviving humans captured in the hunt along with Bright Eyes.

1 Blood trail just keeps going and going but no body.	How the hell did he get away?
2 Fuckers returned fire soon as we lit 'em up. Hard core fuckin' NVA. They got their shit together.

1 Youse a pig man. I hope Manny get dat laundry gig for' you do.	De fool think he's gonna get it but he ain't known for his thinking.
2 He's a fool alright but you a bigger fool. Hey, whiteboy, watcha waiting for - dat hole ain't gonna dig itself...

1 Yeah! I got two of them fuckers...	I got one...
2 ...See them go down? Like fuckin' target practice man, fuck you Charlie!! Ho Chi Minh sucks dead dick!... Crawford! 

1 First time?	Yeah.
2 Then the worm has definately turned for you man.

1 How the fuck you get over here man, you look like you educated...	I volunteered.
2 You WHAT? Say 'gain.	Yeah, I dropped out of college and told 'em I wanted infantry, combat, and Nam...

1 You volunteered for this shit man?	You a crazy fucker, givin' up college man.

1 I know Barnes six months and I'll tell ya something - that man is MEAN, red in his soul like a dick on a dog.	Barnes gets killed, his jaws'd go on clacking...

1 I was home on leave y'know and everybody's just worried 'bout making money, everybody's out for themselves, they don't even want to talk about it man, it's like the fucking Twilight Zone back there - you wouldn't even KNOW there's a war on here. My sister says to me why you have to go there like I started this...	Baaaa! Fuck it, they sold us out - so what! What'd you'all expect? Civilian life is phoney BULLSHIT man. They're ROBOTS man - watchin' dopey television and drivin' dopey cars, and they fuck up, nobody dies. That's all right, you keep fuckin' up, politicians keep lyin'. Cause it don't really matter. Don't mean shit. So what! Whatcha want - a parade! Fuck that too! No war time no grunt never got no respect. Till he was dead - and even THEN! You're fighting for YOURSELF man! You're fighting for your SOUL, dat's all. Remember dat. And it's some goddamn battle too - if you'se a man, wrestle with that angel...  ...Love and Hate - the whole shitbang show, that's the story then and now and it ain't hardly gonna change...

1 Don't I even get my face slapped?	Would you mind?
2 Okay. You win.	If you change your mind about the cocktail party, or anything else, give me a buzz.
3 If I change my mind.

1 Your liquor laws..	Disgusting, aren't they? If you really want a Martini, I know where you can get one.

1 Go ahead...if you want to. It doesn't matter.	I'd rather wait until it does matter.

1 He's a fellow with a very hard knee, and he knows how to use it.	You don't know who he is?
2 He's not a cop. A cop wouldn't have kneed me.	He was following us--but he's not a policeman.
3 Us?	All right--following me.
4 Why?	No matter. There's nothing I can do about it.
5 Anything I can do about it?	Take me home--and forget you ever saw me. That's a silly remark isn't it?
6 Try not talking.

1 I'd still go through--even if I ended up in jail.	You wouldn't like it.  I've been there.
2 My father died in jail, and he was twice the man I am.

1 It wasn't the time or place.  Don't worry about the note, baby.  I'm playing for my neck now.	And I'm begging for my life--and yours.
2 Mine?	Yes.  Yours.  You haven't murdered anybody.  You killed Mitchell. Wasn't that an accident?  It must have been.  If you kill a blackmailer, you kill him dead--so that he can't talk anymore.
3 Mitchell was dead enough.	And that nasty man that followed us last night.  You didn't kill him.
4 Who'd believe it but you?  I took him out to sea and threw him in the water.  Even if they find him, what connects him with me?	Magruder does.
5 You think Magruder wants to hang beside me?	But the next one is murder.  First the little step, then the longer step , and then the step you can never take back.  You could tell about Mitchell.  You could tell about Magruder--and the detective. It would hurt, but you could do it.  You could never tell about me.
6 Would I want to?	Every day of your life you'll want me.  You'll never get over it. Every time you see your face in the mirror--
7 Shut up!  Cut it out!  Even if I have to kill both of us--

1 Good morning, Mr. Killaine. I'm sorry I can't give you the name of my bank--because I have no bank at the moment.  That was a crude trick.	They're all crude, when they don't work. Had breakfast?

1 You've got a couple of hours, maybe.	To do what?
2 I can't answer that.	What will they do to you?
3 That's they're business.  Can I drop you somewhere?	You're still a police officer, Jeff.  I saw you send those two men away. I know they were watching me.

1 You hurt my feelings. I ought to raise the price to be a thousand.	If I call the police, your price will go down to a minus sign.
2 Bluff. You've waited too long.	For five hundred, what do I get?
3 I go home and paint the kitchen.	For two hundred?
4 I stick around and wait for the five hundred.	You mentioned information.
5 Sorry. Another client paid for that. You can hire me not to use it.	A thousand.
6 Got it on you?	Got the information on you?
7 Get it in half an hour.

1 What?	A private joke.

1 In case you want to have us followed.	I don't.
2 Well--good night.

1 What's the matter, baby. Don't you like me anymore?	Lay off, can't you?
2 Lay off what? This is my new girl friend. Met her on the train. She's very fond of me. Love at first sight. Wasn't it, baby?

1 I needn't keep you any longer, Mr. Clarendon.	Thank you. It is rather late... and I'm not young anymore. Good night.

1 Mr. Brandon couldn't be here.  He might have left something for you. What would it look like?	One of those nice long manila envelopes--sealed.  Not too fat- not too thin.
2 What do I get for it?	You get it's brother.
3 Sounds like a fair swap.  Let's take a look.

1 Not too hard, is it?	Maybe we've been pretty dumb--
2 There wasn't any motive...let's try out the act.

1 What about me?	Not quiet yet.

1 No.	I hear she's a very pretty girl.
2 Which forces me to arrest her against my better judgment.	Aye.  You have a point there.

1 I hoped to get enough to cover them before they cleared. I wasn't lucky.	You know what would happen to you if I turned these over to the police?
2 I have a rough idea.	You'd go to jail. For a long term.
3 Correct. I couldn't even afford to pay a lawyer to defend me.

1 My first husband worked for the BBC.  I doubt if anyone there remembers him now, just another long dead diligent administrator. He would have been useful in the fight to preserve the BBC's independence during the Suez crisis - one of the few things he was passionate about.  I became involved too.  I started work on a book that would have been published on the tenth anniversary of Suez. Then he died, and I loots the will to write it.  By the time I was over his death, other books had been published, and it wasn't worth going on.	What a shame.
2 It wasn't much more than a pot boiler.Suez was very important for our generation.  I didn't want it to be forgotten.  And that's why I'd like to be able to help you. But really Mr. Penfield, I looked through my notes before you came, they're all very much out of date, there's been so much published since.  I don't think I'm your man.	Well, I am a great admirer of your work.  I read your books on Chartism when I was still at school.  I'm a journalist, not a historian.  There are questions of method, and approach.  I wondered--
3 I see.  Are you a socialist, Mr. Penfield?	Yes.
4 Good.  Suez was a minefield for both parties.

1 Then I began to listen to what the well-off were saying about the poor now  the war had just ended, and the language was much the same as it had been before the first Reform Act.  A small minority thought that England was really theirs, they had made it, they owned it.  The rest, the wage earners, were foreigners, outsiders intent on wrecking it all.	Didn't Evelyn Waugh say that the country under Atlee seemed to be under enemy occupation?
2 Did he?  I left school and worked for the Labour Party.  My older brother, George, had just been killed in Greece, and he'd been an active member.  I hero-worshipped him.  He was 25 years old ...  It was an exciting time for us, those first couple of years after the war.  We thought the country was about to become a true democracy.  I can understand why people of your generation want to write about that time.  They feel betrayed.  They want to know what went wrong.	What went wrong?
3 Oh, many things.  Inertia ... Stalin and the Cold War... a failure of nerve.  We took the seediest, most inefficient fifth of the economy into State care, paid out millions for it, put the same old duffers in charge.  A new broom with very old bristles.  When the Tories were returned, I went and sat in the BM and wrote my little book on Chartism.

1 Committed to memory.  Forever.	I see.

1 Can I give you a lift?	No, it's all right.  I can get a cab.  Night night.

1 Do you think she's invited you up for her sake or for mine?	I haven't really thought about it.
2 Well, you should.

1 Bastard.	Name so Susie Barrington.  Daughter of the eminent historian, Anne Barrington, step-daughter of the scandalous Matthew Byrd the acclaimed sack-artist...

1 Six onion bajees!  Great girl.  Did you shake the mother off?	Yes, finally.
2 Big mistake, I think.  You might have learned a lot.	Are you up to something?

1 I've got to be going.  I've got a meeting tonight.	The bed's all made up if you want to stay.
2 I'll ring you in the next couple of days.

1 It was incredible.  He came back, made a pompous little bow and said, 'My dear girl you may film me all afternoon if you wish.' And he's promised not to talk to the Press.	It's because he desires you.  The women get all the breaks at these conferences.
2 It's true!  I was here last year doing a piece, remember?  I was in the bar with all these Northern trade unionists and their sponsored MPs.  They were all incredibly fat and beery, huge trousers and braces. And so sweet.  They all stood round me like children saying 'You! Working for television?  You're just a young thing.'  They wouldn't let me buy drinks even when I told them the programme was paying. They kept looking at my pass which was pinned here and saying  'Oo, can I?'	Then one of them was sick all over your new dress.
3 No, he wasn't.  He just lowered himself into a bar stool and said...  'Oo I do feel bad.  I 'ad three pints of lager and six onion bajees!'

1 Football's a man-made game.  You keep score with numbers.  But in this, there's no field, no rules, no opponent.  Just you and the wave.	I know that part.  Tell me something I can use, here.
2 I've watched you once or twice.  You surf like it's some kind of street fight.  You jerk along from moment to moment, fighting everything that comes at you.  Always trying to win.	A flaw I'm working on.
3 The only way to win out here is to surrender.  You have to feel what the wave is doing, accept its energy, get in sync.  Just feel it all moving in the blackness... you don't need to see.	Yeah, right, vision is highly over- rated.

1 You're a fucking dead man--	Whoa, whoa!!  Think it through!  I'm the only one knows where they are. Just let me talk for a second.

1 Three seconds... two... one...	SHIT!!

1 Special Agent Utah, this is not some job flippin' burgers at the drive-in. Yes, the surfboard bothers me.  Yes, your approach to this case bothers me.  And yes, you bother me.  You two have produced squat in the last two weeks, during which time the Ex- Presidents have robbed two more banks!!  Do you have anything even remotely interesting to tell me?	Caught my first tube this morning.

1 Surgical.  Look at them separate the dye packs.  Dick and Ronny know their jobs.	The Ex-Presidents are the best I've seen, kid.

1 What, you couldn't have just left the thing in your car?	It sticks out, so I can't lock it. Look, Angelo, you think I joined the FBI to learn to surf?  This was your lame-o idea in the first place.  You gotta back me up on this.
2 Johnny, all I can say is we better come up with something real soon.

1 Aw shit.	Nice tattoo, Dietz.

1 What do you want?	Shrimp and fries.
2 I mean, what do you want?  What are you doing hanging around here.	I need you to teach me.
3 Gimme a break.  One shrimp and fries to go!  Anything to drink?	I'm serious.
4 I can see that.  But forget it. Stick to tennis, or whatever you're good at.  Miniature golf.  Here, your number's 37.	Well, I'm just gonna go back out there till I catch on to it or break my neck.

1 Look at you.	What?
2 Well, usually you have this sort of intense scowl of concentration, like you're doing this for a school project or something... I don't know, like something's driving you.  See, it's gone.  If I didn't know better I'd say you looked almost happy.	I... I don't know.  I can't describe what I'm feeling.
3 You don't have to.

1 Major, looks like there were ten, maybe twelve guerrillas. Looks like they took some prisoners from the chopper.  Then a different set of track, over there.	What do you mean?
2 Six others, U.S. issue jungle boots. They came in from the north, then followed the guerrillas.

1 I knew this man. Green Berets, out of Fort Bragg. What the hell were they doing in here? You got any answers for this, Dillon?	Jesus... this is inhuman.  Uh... I wasn't told of any operations in this area. They shouldn't have been here.
2 Well somebody sent them.

1 Thanks.	Anytime.

1 That's over the border, General.	That's the problem. Apparently they strayed off course.  We're certain they've been captured by the guerrillas.

1 Mr. Harris, we know you've purchased at least twenty percent of our stock.  We also know you plan to file a formal bid for a majority share.	Twenty-five percent.

1 Congratulations, sir.	What?
2 Mr. Kross is just getting off the phone with his stock broker. It's finished.  You've won.

1 Hey Sugar, you lookin' for a date?	What's that?
2 You looking' for some company?	Uh, no.  How do I get to Beverly Hills?
3 What?  You gonna tell me you're lost?	Yes.
4 Great.  What do I look like a tourguide?

1 Three hundred.	Fine.
2 What's your name, lover.	Edward.  My name is Edward.
3 Edward... you got it!

1 It's a very good year.	Oooh, thank god.

1 So what a ya do with the companies once you buy'm?	I sell them.
2 What?  Why?

1 You're upset, huh?	Upset.  No.  I never get upset about business.
2 You liked the guy, though.	Whether I liked him or not is irrelevant.  It's business. There's no emotion involved in business... if you want to survive.
3 We're the exactly the same!  Kit keeps telling me don't get emotional when you turn tricks -- that's why no kissing -- it's too personal. The key is like you're saying, stay numb, don't get involved -- when I'm with a guy, I'm a robot, I just do it.  Except with you.  At your price I give my all...

1 Real genuine guy.	He's good at what he does.
2 You could freeze ice on his wife's ass.  She anything like your ex?	Shall we mingle?

1 You don't want to go all the way to San Francisco in a limousine, do you?  I don't.	Where are you taking me!?
2 To meet some friends.  Rudolpho, a poet... Benoit, a landlord... Mimi, a flower maker...	Huh?
3 The opera.

1 Why do guys always know how to hit a woman?  Right across the cheek, wham, so it feels like your eye is gonna explode.  What do they do, take you all aside in high school and show you how? It pisses me off!	Not all men hit.  And no one is going to hit you anymore.
2 Right.  You're quite the Sir Galahad today, aren't ya'?  I heard what you did with Kross.	It was a business decision.

1 Love this car!  Is it new?	Yes!  And you don't even know where you're going!

1 Why do you want to know?	Hear me out.  I've known you a long time.  I see a difference in you this week.  Like that tie. I'm suddenly wondering if this girl's not the difference. Especially when I see her talking with David Kross.

1 We worked for that money.  We were gonna put together enough to get out of that dump we live in, get off this street.	Viv... don't be stupid.  We're whores.

1 Want a pair of boots?	Do I!?  Momma!

1 I got a dress.	I rather hoped you'd be wearing it.
2 I didn't want to get it messed. I got shoes too.  Wanna see?	That's all right.  I'm sure they're quite lovely.
3 They were real nice to me there. They treated me, y'know... nice. Thanks, Barney.

1 Would you like to try it on?	'Scume me.

1 If we surrender, and I return with you, will you promise not to hurt this man?	May I live a thousand years and never hunt again.
2 He is a sailor on the pirate ship "Revenge." Promise to return him to his ship.	I swear it will be done.

1 Catch your breath.	If you'll release me ... whatever you ask for ransom ... you'll get it, I promise you...
2 And what is that worth, the promise of a woman? You're very funny, Highness.	I was giving you a chance. No matter where you take me ... there's no greater hunter than Prince Humperdinck. He could track a falcon on a cloudy day. He can find you
3 You think your dearest love will save you? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           50.

1 I fear I'll never see you again.	Of course you will.
2 But what if something happens to you?	Hear this now: I will come for you.
3 But how can you be sure?	This is true love. You think this happens every day?

1 Oh, Westley, will you ever forgive me?	What hideous sin have you committed lately?
2 I got married. I didn't want to. It all happened so fast.	It never happened.
3 What?	It never happened. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          117.

1 I've hired you to help me start a war. That's a prestigious line of work with a long and glorious tradition.	I just don't think it's right, killing an innocent girl.
2 Am I going mad or did the word "think" escape your lips? You were not hired for your brains, you hippopotamic land mass.

1 He's with the Prince in the Castle. But the castle gate is guarded by thirty men.	How many could you handle?
2 I don't think more than ten.	That leaves twenty for me. At my best, I could never defeat that many.  I need Vizzini to plan. I have no gift for strategy. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           82.

1 Don't pester him, he's had a hard day.	Right, right, sorry.

1 What?	The Eel doesn't get her. I'm explaining to you because you looked nervous.
2 Well, I wasn't nervous.

1 Maybe you could come over and read it again to me tomorrow.	As you wish...

1 Once we're out of sight, take him back to Florin and throw him in the Pit of Despair.	I swear it will be done.

1 Why? You can't even lift one.	True, but that's hardly common knowledge, is it?  Thank you. Now, there may be problems once we're inside.
2 I'll say -- how do I find the Count? -- Once I do, how do I find you again? -- Once I find you again, how do we escape? --

1 Look, I'm retired. And besides, why would you want someone the King's stinking son fired? I might kill whoever you wanted me to miracle.	He's already dead.
2 He is, eh? I'll take a look. Bring him in.

1 I could do that. In fact, I've got some rope up here. But I do not think that you will accept my help, since I am only waiting around to kill you.	That does put a damper on our relationship.

1 Because I know something you don't know.	And what is that?
2 I am not left-handed.

1 He didn't fall? Inconceivable!!	You keep using that word -- I do not think it means what you think it means.  My God! He's climbing.

1 What's so funny?	I'll tell you in a minute. First, let's drink -- me from my glass, and you from yours.

1 "By the light, by the light,	"Of the silvery moon,
2 "Of the silvery mooooon,	"I want to croon,
3 "He wants to croon, he wants to croon,	"To my honey I'll croon,
4 "He's gonna croon love's tune,	"Honeymoon,
5 "Honeymoon, honeymoon,	"Keep a shining in...

1 Here, don't panic.	I'm sorry ... I don't like people touching my blue blanket.  It's not important.  It's a minor compulsion. I can deal with it if I want to. It's just that I've had it ever since I was a baby and ... and ... I find it very comforting.
2 They come here.  They all come here. How do they find me?	Mr. Bialystock ...
3 Yes, Prince Mishkin, what can we do for you?

1 Okay.  I'm way over here.  Is that better?	It's a little better, but you still look angry.
2 How's this? 

1 Max, I don't want to take any Siegfried Oath.  I don't know what it is, but I don't want to take it. We might end up in the German Army.	Shut up, you idiot.  He's a harmless nut.  Play along with him.  It's almost in the bag.

1 What are you doing with those books? Where are you going?	I'm turning myself in.  It's the only way.  I'm going to cooperate with the authorities.  They'll reduce my sentence and then there's time off for good behavior.  And maybe I'll get a job in the prison library.  So long.

1 Wait.  No.  How do I know I can trust you?  How do I know you vill present this play in the manner and spirit in vhich it vas conceived?	We swear it!
2 Not good enough... Vould you be villing to take the Siegfried oath?	Yes.  We would!
3 Good.  I will make the preparations.

1 Vhy do you always call me kraut? Kraut is cabbage!  Do ve call you hot dogs?  Ve call you Yanks not franks!	All right.  Finish the job.  Let's get outta here.

1 Finder's keepers.	Here I come, ready or not.

1 No, not at all sir, we're quite serious.  We want to produce your play.  I have the contracts right here.	Oh joy of joys!  Oh, dream of dreams!  I can't believe it.  Birds, birds, do you hear?  Otto, Bertz, Heintz, Hans, Wolfgang, do you hear?  Ve are going to clear the Fuhrer's name.  Fly, fly, spread the words.
2 "Deutchland, Deutchland, uber alles, Uber alles in der velt."	"Deutchland, Deutchland ... "
3 Mr. Liebkind, Mr. Liebkind.	Vat?
4 People can hear you.	OH.  "I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy, Yankee Doodle is my ... " Listen, this is not place to talk.  Come! 

1 No. At least I don't recall.	She might have used an alias. Mary Crane's the real name, but she might've registered...
2 I don't even bother with guests registering any more... I mean, little by little, you drop the formalities.  I shouldn't even bother to change the linen. I guess habits die hard. Which reminds me...

1 Did you check in Phoenix... hospitals... maybe she had an accident... a hold-up...	She was seen leaving town in her car. Seen by her very victims, I might add.
2 I don't believe it.  Do you?

1 Aren't you going to take the pills?  They'll knock that headache out.	I don't need pills... just sleep.

1 Did he say anything about my sister?	Just what he told your detective.

1 Got the number of the motel out on the old highway? Bates, I think. 	Sam! Why call when we can go?
2 And maybe pass Arbogast on the road?  Thanks.

1 I wonder if we'll ever see Mary again.	Of course we will.
2 Alive.

1 You can't go up there.	Why not?
2 Bates.

1 Stuffy in here.  Well... the mattress is soft and there're hangers in the closet and... stationary with "Bates' Motel" printed on it in case you want to make your friends back home envious... and... the... over there.... 	The bathroom.
2 I'll be in the office if you want anything... just tap on the wall.	Thank you, Mr. Bates.
3 Norman Bates.

1 In the course of my duty, I never "take up" anyone's time, whether it's to give a warning, or a ticket, or help! Believe that, M'am.  Now if you woke up on the wrong side of... the car seat, that's one thing. But when you act as if I've just placed you under arrest...	I'm sorry.
2 No need to apologize...

1 Norman? Sheriff Chambers.  Been just fine, thanks. Listen, we got some worries here. Did you have a man stop out there tonight...  Well, this one wouldn't be a customer, anyway. A private detective, name of...	Arbogast.
2 Arbogast.  And after he left?  No, it's okay, Norman. How's it been going out there?  Well, I think you oughta unload that place and open up closer in to the action, a smaller place, you know... but...

1 I'm not saying you shouldn't be contented here, I'm just doubting that you are. I think if you saw a chance to get out from under... you'd unload this place...	This place! This isn't 'a place.' It's my only world. I grew up in that house back there. I was a happy child. My mother and I... we were more than happy.
2 And now that your mother's dead?

1 You didn't find anything.	Nothing. Here, let's clear the path.

1 No-	Who are you? What is your name?
2 I don't know, [I tell you].

1 Oh, him. He has a cat of his own. But his assistant--he's the cat-hatenest man I ever saw. Goofy, if ya ast me.]	By the way--did you hear a shot last night?

1 What are you going to do?	I'm going to call the police.
2 No, you can't do that--they'll get suspicious--

1 There's no child here, and no dogs either.	No?
2 No!  Good night!

1 Why, certainly, sir. My fiance. Charlotte, may I present Mr. Igor.	Delighted, I'm sure. 

1 What! What are you talking about?	The body of Joan Gale!
2 Hello, Express. What's the idea, trying to outsmart the police?	I'm not kidding. Joan Gale's body is packed in the box in the basement, and I saw the most horrible thing down there.
3 Are you giving me this straight?	Don't take my word for it. Get down there yourself and give a look.

1 Come in, Prussic Acid. What's on your mind?	I want to see the original pictures of Joan Gale.
2 Hey, Mattie, dig into the morgue and send up all the art you have on Joan Gale.

1 Make it snappy, Colonel.	There's an autopsy ordered at Bellevue immediately. You better skip over there.
2 Don't give this to anybody else, will you?	It's all yours.
3 Thanks.

1 Listen, kid. You're in a tough spot, and you can make it a whole lot easier for yourself if you cut out the cry-baby stuff --	Cry-baby?
2 That's what I said.	My lawyers will be on the job in a little while, and I warn you people anything you print about me you've got to prove. Dad won't stand for--
3 Your dad has stood for plenty. Now let's get down to cases. When did you see the Dale girl last?	For a few minutes the afternoon before -- before --
4 Hmmm. Why didn't you tell that to the police?	They didn't give me a chance. We had a couple of drinks and she was all right then. She seemed happy.
5 Uh-huh. Do you remember what she said? What did you talk about?	She laughed and told me that we were being silly, that we didn't care for each other any more but we needn't hate each other ...  ... She said she wanted to be friends.
6 I see. Was that all she said?	We planned a trip for her. I was going to send her to Bermuda.
7 You weren't going with her?	No.  Why didn't I take her out somewhere? But she was laughing and seemed so happy.
8 Well, let's get back to the case in hand. They ordered an autopsy and discovered her body had been stolen from the morgue.	Stolen! What are you trying to do to me? ... You're working with the police! ... You're trying to make me say something that can be used against me! You're trying ...
9 Hold on, hold on. I'm trying to help you, if you're on the square, and I think you are.	Then why are you telling me a crazy lie? ...
10 That happens to be the truth.	Who'd steal her body?
11 That's what they're going to ask you.

1 A fire! Is this your idea of humor, my friend?	I want the money back I've thrown into this rubbish heap.
2 You are asking to burn these people ... you are asking? ... 

1 I'd know him anywhere.	Don't lose sight of him. This is the most important thing in my life.

1 Could you?	Where to?
2 A place you've never been.	That's the physicist's playground.

1 I've been dreaming about this.	Then you get it.  You'll understand.
2 What?

1 Hmmm, it's soft. It's awful soft.	What did you expect?
2 Well, I thought they were more like a cantaloupe.	Ha ha ha, that's some idea, a cantaloupe.
3 There's some kind of gristle in it, though.	Buddy, quit that, you're just a child, you're not supposed to be interested in such things.
4 Actually, I am, though.	You know, that Daddy of yours is the funniest man, the things he says, you never know what's going to come out of his mouth next.
5 Can I put my hand inside your nightgown, Rose?	No, you can't. And I'll tell you this -- he scares me. As kind as he is, he scares me. You can't fool around with him, not with that man. And, boy, I sure better not try nothin' like that with him again, he'll fire me.
6 Rose, can't I see what the nipple on it is like?	Buddy, what's come over you? A child like you, askin' such things.
7 But I'm curious, Rose.

1 Here comes Daddy.	I have a knack for designing clothes. But I had to buy the shoes and the pocketbook.

1 Neither do I.	Oh, Waski, you don't even know what we're talking about.
2 I do, too.

1 See, son? The paint is flaked off here, freshly. Look at it, Brother, there is no question about it. Some person or persons unknown have very recently tampered with this ladder.	Well... maybe...
2 And there's only one reason anybody would want this ladder -- to get up into Rose's bedroom in the dark of night! I am going to chain up this ladder and padlock it! -- and that is not all I am going to do!

1 Rose is almost as sentimental as Mother. If there's one thing I can't stand it's sentimentality. In Chattanooga this man committed an almost perfect murder. He killed his wife with a black widow spider.	Oh, shut up, Buddy.

1 She's putting the titty back.	Buddy, that was my place.

1 Well, you rascal, where'd you come from?	Hello, Daddy. How are you?
2 About as good as can be expected with one foot in the grave. Good to see you, son.  Did you bring any of that Yankee whisky with you?	It isn't Yankee whisky, Daddy, it's Scotch.
3 It's Yankee whisky to me.

1 I am ahead of you.	Then... may I speak quite frankly with you, Mr. Hillyer?
2 Please do.	I have of course observed the girl in treating her.
3 Of course.	I think we both know her.
4 Yes, we know her.

1 I wish you wouldn't pick on Rose and tease her like that. Of course her clothes are silly, but she's ignorant, naive, she doesn't know any better.	The girl worries me. If she walks down the street like that, an army will be following her.
2 Well, I admit that outfit isn't very modest. But she doesn't mean any harm, she just wants to attract, attention.	She will succeed.
3 I don't think you understand her. It isn't sex she wants, it's love she wants and this is the only way she knows how to get it.	That farmer in Gadsden was awful eager to get rid of her, and I'm beginning to see why.
4 He and his wife both said she had a fine moral character and was wonderful with children.	Well, she loves children, all right.  She loves everybody.
5 But that's a wonderful quality, not a bad quality.  Have a little patience with her. She's such a good-hearted little thing and tries so hard.	You are the one who's good-hearted.  As for Rose, let's hope for the best.
6 Be kind to her. She loves you so much.  In a perfectly proper way, of course.	Yes, of course.

1 Excuse me, sir, are you calling my wife a liar?	Honey, please...

1 This is a total catastrastroke. As of this moment I am stumped, I admit, I am stumped and treed both, the hound dogs have me surrounded.	Poor thing, don't cry, Rose. I know you feel awful, but don't cry, honey, nobody's perfect. Who's the father, dear?

1 Why, that looks like Dave Wilkie,	Who?
2 You know Dave, his wife used to do dressmaking for you before she died.

1 You're so sweet.	If you've got time before you go "out," get me a half-a-cup of coffee, Rose. Not a whole cup, a half-a-cup.
2 Why, sure, always got time to get you a half-a-cup, and one of these days I'm gonna get you a whole cup and see what happens.	Um-hmmuhh. I never drink a whole cup, my nerves can't stand the caffeine. Ehh-hh, Lord awful insomnia in reverse last night. Lay there and sweated blood for hours.

1 Good morning, Rose. And how do you feel today?	Wonderful. Except I can touch the place back there with my tongue, I wouldn't even know I had that tooth pulled.
2 Well, I know it, I just got the bill for it.	Boy, for four or five days there I didn't think I'd live. But I'm my old self again!
3 Umm. Well. Yes. But no more strange voices in the night, Rose.	Oh, no, sir.

1 I'm not cryin' because of me, I'm cryin' because of somebody else.	What?

1 Um-m, well...	Doubted my ability all along, the little bitch. I never remarried, Buddy, you know that, don't you?
2 Well, no, I didn't actually.	She's te reason -- cured me of women once and for all. Oh, I got rid of her, Buddy, I didn't waste no time kickin' that bitch out. Hell, she was screwin' everybody in Savannah. I caught her in a motel with this long tall son of a bitch and boy did I beat the everlastin' piss out of him!

1 Yes, thank you, Doctor.	I beg your pardon, epi-zoo-tics? Do you mean "epi-zoo-ot-tics," an animal epidemic?

1 Mother... is Rose going to die?	No, Waski, she won't die, because we are praying for her.

1 Poor thing. Does the ice help, Rose?	Ohh-hh, a little. Oh-h, I ain't never been to no dentist before. He's gonna kill me, I just know it.
2 No, Rose, he'll help you.

1 Don't worry, honey, you'll find something.	I was offered that job as a waitress.
2 Forget about it, I don't want you working in one of those honky tonks.

1 Have I ever steered you wrong?	Cuff'em.  Let's see what these two love birds say once they're sitting in separate cages.

1 Oh, you fuckers!  You fucking fuckers!  What?  What do you want?	Word is, while the vice cops on the East Coast were standing around playing pocket pool, 300 kilos of heroin got smuggled into New York City.  And, right now it's making a cross-country journey to Hollywood, U.S.A.

1 I... I can't find my seatbelt.	What do you want me to do about it?

1 "A.D."	Who's that?  Zimmermann's money-man?

1 Who's been giving you history lessons?  Your bartender?	Okay, seriously.  What about Napoleon, huh?
2 What about him?	You've never heard of Napoleon brandy, Mister Smarty-Pants?  How do you think it got its name?

1 Hey...	Forgive me for not ooing cartwheels over commemorative salt and pepper shakers

1 You live like a pig.	Can't you say something nice once?
2 Okay.  It doesn't smell as bad in here as I remember it smelling.

1 Hey now, look!  Let's all get on the same page here.  This shipment is do or die for Zimmermann's syndicate; all or nothing.  If we stop the drugs, we don't even have to catch him red-handed.  He's ruined cause his pushers go broke with nothing to sell.  On the other hand, if we fuck this up, it means more zombies crawling the gutters than ever and a morgue that doesn't have a single empty drawer.  More old ladies getting mugged and molested by junk-hungry needle-freaks, and all the while Zimmermann's sitting back and laughing his head off.	There'll be other chances.
2 Not like this.  Are you even listening?

1 Your poison's not gonna make it into the veins of any kids this time.	Wave that flag, hero.  Keep dreaming those dreams.

1 Hold your horses, sweetpea.  We need Butch Cassidy alive, remember?	Shit.  You're right.

1 Any preferences?	Whatever goes bang.

1 You're... you're not doing what I think you're doing... ?	Seatbelts fastened, please.

1 You see that?	Yeah.
2 Good.  Thought I was imagining them.

1 You told me Vader betrayed and murdered my father.	You father was seduced by the dark side of the Force. He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker and became Darth Vader. When that happened, the good man who was your father was destroyed. So what I have told you was true... from a certain point of view.

1 Oh, no, my young Jedi. You will find that it is you who are mistaken...about a great many things.	His lightsaber.

1 I thought she was with you.	We got separated.

1 What's going on?	I don't know.

1 Chewie! Chewie, give me the gun. Don't move, Lando.	No, wait! I thought you were blind!
2 It's all right. Trust me. Don't move.	All right! A little higher! Just a little higher!

1 What did he say?	I'm rather embarrassed, General Solo, but it appears you are to be the main course at a banquet in my honor.

1 Now lock onto the strongest power source. It should be the power generator.	Form up. And stay alert. We could run out of space real fast.

1 Luke, don't talk that way. You have a power I--I don't understand and could never have.	You're wrong, Leia. You have that power too. In time you'll learn to use it as I have. The Force is strong in my family. My father has it...I have it...and...my sister has it.

1 Yoda, I must know.	Your father he is.

1 I see.  So this wasn't simply a chance meeting.  You came here with a purpose.	I told you, my car broke down.

1 Gosh.  That's the third motorcyclist that's passed us.  They certainly take their lives in their hands.  What with the weather and all.	Yes, Janet.  Life's pretty cheap to that type.

1 Right!	We'll just say where we are Then go back to the car We don't want to be any worry.

1 Good God.	Yes.

1 On the day I went away.	Goodbye
2 Was all I had to say	Now I
3 Want to come again and stay	Oh my, my,
4 Smile and that will mean I may

1 I thought you liked them.  They liked you.	They didn't like me.  They never liked me.

1 Y'know how I got started in the fight racket?	By accident?

1 Y'know how I said that stuff on television didn't bother me?	Yes.
2 It did.

1 I been watchin' the movies -- studyin' -- He ain't weak nowhere.	What're we going to do?
2 ...I dunno.	Oh, Rocky -- you worked so hard.
3 It ain't so bad, 'cause I was a nothin' before --	Don't say that.
4 C'mon, it's true -- But that don't bother me -- I just wanna prove somethin' -- I ain't no bum... It don't matter if I lose... Don't matter if he opens my head... The only thing I wanna do is go the distance -- That's all. Nobody's ever gone fifteen rounds with Creed. If I go them fifteen rounds, an' that bell rings an' I'm still standin', I'm gonna know then I weren't just another bum from the neighborhood...

1 I do -- Maybe what this fight needs is something new -- a novelty.	You's the novelty, Champ!
2 Give my main man a raise!!

1 Shape, nothin' -- They're afraid. They know everybody in the world's gonna see this fight an' none of them gotta prayer of beating me so they're makin' excuses so they don't have to be the chump that's gonna be whipped in front of the whole civilized world!!	Apollo, I'm sure there's a way to salvage this.

1 I don't like ya face.	Don't like yours neither.
2 Kiss my ass.	Move your shoulders down.

1 ...How 'bout for the Cokes?	Charge it.

1 Don't hit the face! Not the face!!	Mr. Gazzo wants the two hundred now!
2 Honest to God I'm broke -- Gimme a break.	Mr. Gazzo says I should get two hundred or break the thumb.
3 Please, I need my hands to work -- Christ, don't bust my thumbs.

1 Y'know I won't be able to work for ya no more.	Hey -- if a good man can make a better life, let him make it.
2 I feel bad about walkin'.	Take your shot, kid -- You got money for trainin' expenses?
3 A few bucks.

1 Nobody likes garbage -- Anyway, this girl with the dirty mouth wasn't bad lookin', but the guys wouldn't take her out for any serious datin'.	Why?
2 'Cause that's the way guys are -- They laugh when ya talk dirty. They think ya cute for a while, but then ya getta reputation an' watch out. Nobody's ever gonna take ya serious. Ya get no respect... I gotta use a bad word -- Whore. You'll end up maybe becomin' a whore.	C'mon, Rocky. I'm twelve.
3 That doesn't matter -- You don't really have to be a whore, just act like one an' that's it.	What?
4 Yo, a bad reputation -- Twenty years from now people will say 'D'you remember Marie?' 'No, who was she?' 'She was that little whore who hung out at the Atomic Hoagie Shop.' 'Oh, now I remember!'... See, they don't remember you, they remember the rep.

1 Best seat in the house -- Hey, Mick, this is too much.	How do you mean?
2 I'm usta seein' ya at the gym, but seein' ya here, in my house, it's kinda outta joint.

1 Don't you care what the people will say?	...I'm doin' it for a friend.
2 Whatta you get outta this?	I get the robe an' Paulie gets three grand.
3 ...Shrewd.

1 You were ready to bite that guy's face.	Yeah -- See the fight last night? Apollo Creed beat that English guy bad.
2 Creed's great.

1 I usta be deadly at half-ball.	I hate the friggin' game... I'd like to talk some business.
2 What kinda business?	Look at my hands -- See how the joints are swollen.

1 Ya really like her?	Sure I like her.
2 What's the attraction? I don't see it?	I dunno -- she fills gaps.
3 What gaps?	She got gaps. I got gaps -- together we fill the gaps.
4 You ballin' her?	Don't talk dirty 'bout ya sister.
5 C'mon, ya screwin' her?

1 Oh, a ladies man, huh?	My problem is I got a fifty-year-old lust and a three-year-old dinkie.

1 This is fifty bucks.  I need seventy-five before they check the books tomorrow.	You'll have it in the morning.  Now be a sport and lemme have twenty bucks to put in my pocket.
2 Is this paper even good?	Check the scrawl.
3 R.K. Maroon.

1 Can you get him out of it, Eddie?	If I can find whoever wanted to kill Acme bad enough to get this.

1 Marvin Acme had no will.  I should know, the probate is in my court.	He had a will, all right.  She took it off Acme the night she and R.K. Maroon knocked him off.  Then she set up her loving husband to take the fall.

1 Right here where we're standing, will be the cornerstone of my idea... the cloverleaf -- an elegant cement structure that intertwines freeways.	What the hell's a freeway?
2 A freeway, Mr. Valiant, is eight lanes of asphalt running uninterrupted from L.A. to Pasadena.  Pasadena to Hollywood.  Hollywood to Santa Monica. Someday everyone will be in cars driving happily, non-stop from one end of the L.A. Basin to another.	That's what this is all about?  Tell me, who's gonna use your lousy freeway? We got the Red Cars, the best public transportation in the country.
3 Not for long.  We're retiring the Red Cars.  People will drive, Mr. Valiant, because they'll have to.  And when they drive, they'll have to buy our cars, our tires, our gasoline.

1 You shot Roger.	That's not Roger.  It's one of Doom's men.  He killed R.K. Maroon.

1 Where'd this gargoyle come from anyway?	No one knows.  He bought the election a few years back.  He's been rulin' Toontown ever since.

1 Son-of-a-bitch...  Mr. Maroon, I think I'll be goin' now, so about the rest of my fee...	Sure, Valiant, sure...

1 Look, pal, if you're still here when I finish this drink, I'm callin' the police.	Don't do that!  I'm innocent I tell ya. The police'll just dip me.  They were waitin' for me when I got home last night.  I ran.
2 If you're so innocent, why'd you run?	Gee, Eddie, I'm a rabbit.  We always run.

1 Hey, doesn't the rabbit even get a last request?	A blindfold, cigarette, noseplugs? Just kidding.
2 I think you want a drink.  How about it, Judge?

1 You know, Eddie, I'm not as much of a chump, and a patsy, a yokel as you think.	How much is a shave and a haircut, Roger?
2 Two bits.	I rest my case.

1 Boo! Ah, ha ha. Ooh. Boo! Ha ha ha.	I will bite my thumb at them; which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.
2 Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?	I do bite my thumb, sir!
3 Do you bite your thumb at us? Sir.	[Aside to GREGORY] Is the law on our side, if I say ay?

1 Every man betake him to his legs.	But 'tis no wit to go.

1 How well my comfort is revived by this.	Hie you make haste! But look thou stay not till the watch be set, for then thou canst not pass to Mantua where thau shalt live till we can find a time to blaze you marriage, reconcile your friends, beg pardon of the Prince and call thee back with twenty hundred times more joy, than thou wentst forth in lamentation. Quick hence! Be gone by break of day! Sojourn in Mantua.
2 Farewell.

1 Juliet!	Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed. If that thy bent of love be honourable, Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow, By one that I'll procure to come to thee, Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite; And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay And follow thee my lord throughout the world.
2 [Within] Juliet!	I uh, by and by I come--But if thou mean'st not well, I do beseech thee--
3 [Within] Juliet!	By and by, I come: -- To cease thy strief, and leave me to my grief: To-morrow will I send.

1 Nurse, give leave awhile, We must talk in secret. Nurse, come back again; I have remember'd me, thou's hear our counsel. Nurse, Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age.	Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed.
2 By my count, I was your mother much upon these years, You are now a maid. Thus then in brief: The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.	A man, young lady! Lady, such a man As all the world- -why, he's a man of wax.
3 Verona's summer hath not such a flower.	Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower.
4 This night you shall behold him at our feast; Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face, And find delight writ there with beauty's pen; This precious book of love, this unbound lover, To beautify him, only lacks a cover: So shall you share all that he doth possess, By having him, making yourself no less.	Nay, bigger; women grow by men.
5 Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?

1 Madam, your mother craves a word with you. Come lets away.	Is she a Capulet?
2 His name is Romeo, and he's a Montague; The only son of your great enemy.

1 And then Sam, you and I clean up whatever's left to be cleaned.	Very good.  Now all we have to do is live long enough to get paid.

1 I never did trust that blonde fuck...	That's why you were riding with him.

1 Sam.  I'm a weapons guy.	You were a soldier, were you?
2 Once.

1 Are you alright?	Alright?  It's bloody fucking freezing in here!

1 Yes, Gregor, they sent me.	I'm touched, really, that they'd send someone of your caliber.  It's nice to know that they didn't make the mistake of underestimating me twice.
2 That was a mistake, trying to kill you. Mikhi did it without consulting me, I'd have never allowed it.	I'm sure.  But I'm sorry to say that it's too late for trust: we have a serious problem.
3 We'll double your price.	Really?  Do you have the money with you?
4 Do you have the material?	You first, Edvard.
5 Perhaps we could both go at the same time...	I think not.  After you...

1 What am I doing here?  Why, I'm here to see my partners, Gregor, the boys in the Russian Mafia.  See, your bosses had hoped to screw me by hiring you to pull your thieving double cross.  But they only just found out that what's in the briefcase is completely useless without me.  I can't fight them, and they can't kill me -- that means we're gonna have to do business together.	But you hate each other!
2 What's a little hate between business partners?

1 Hello, Jean-Pierre.	Hello, my friend.  He doesn't look French to me, Vincent.

1 The point remains: we could be working for different people.  There's a chance for one of us...  Maybe more than one of us -- has been paid to cross the others.  I don't know about you guys, but I like to know who I'm working for.  It can help prevent a great deal of...  ...unpleasantness.	Anybody tries to unpleasant me I'll put two between his eyes -- one to do the job and the other to make sure it takes.

1 I don't particularly like killing, tubby, but I want you to know that this one I'm going to enjoy.	I don't think so.

1 That was a nice move you did on our young friend.  Judo?	Jujitsu.
2 Same thing, isn't it?	Not at all.  Similar, but not the same.
3 What's the difference?	One's a lot more painful than the other.

1 What's going on?	You weren't around when I woke up, I thought maybe something had happened.  This has been one very fucked up job, Sam, and I'm not taking any more chances on anybody...  Including you...

1 The Irish representative?	Yes.

1 Do we need anything else?	Yeah.  We need out fucking heads examined.

1 Why's that?	Cause the Russian production company would be easier to find.
2 It's the Irish tape we want.	Gonna be tough.

1 Seamus Reilly, boy's a serious Irish Auteur -- a real firebrand.  Thinks his more moderate filmmaking brethren have turned to making movies for peace-loving pussies, if you see what I'm saying.	I get the picture.

1 How old is Otis anyhow, thirty?	The horniest dog in Nevada.

1 It's no accident we stumbled on this money.  It's an answer to a prayer!  Every night and every day I've prayed that God would just -- help me out a little, give me a little push.  Tonight my prayer came true.	Oh so God's like Western Union and he just dropped us a couple million bucks?
2 That's right!	At the expense of six people.
3 They killed themselves.  Besides, they were breaking the law.  What they were doing was wrong!  Whatsamatter Booth, don't you believe in miracles?

1 I'm not letting some gangbanger send me to jail.  We can't risk it.	What are you thinking?

1 You're thinking about killing him. I can't do that.  No way.  I've never killed a man.  Never even shot at one.	Well neither have I, but it's us or him.  If he talks, or writes a note or whatever, he's gonna turn us in.  Besides, he's just a low life scumbag.  His kind is hardly even human anyway.
2 I can't do that.	Okay then.  I'll do it.

1 You're crazy.	How badly do you want that money?! How bad do you want to stay out of jail?
2 Not bad enough to kill him.	Who said anything about killing?  Just keep driving straight...

1 We got to get out of here.  Do you understand?  We got to get out of here right now!	No.  It stops now.  It stops here.
2 What do you mean?  Look.  We can make still make it work.

1 Well, I don't know...	That's the deal.  If you don't like it, forget it, no one wins.

1 Could it have been in the Mercedes?	Maybe.  That's where it was during Denning's last report.

1 Yeah.	It was all over the local news. Dwayne was there, acting all official.
2 I know.

1 So do I.	I love you Sally.
2 I love you.

1 Test the product?	Yeah.
2 Sounds like you don't trust me.

1 I guess we can get started.	I wanted to ask you some questions about last night.

1 OK...this is good.  Our first solid lead.	Did you say After Midnight?

1 Well...I should have done a little homework, getting all the sizes, and what not.	Sure.
2 I'm just not very good...with all of this stuff.	Oh, that's ok, a lot of men feel uncomfortable when they come in here.
3 A lot of men come in here?	Oh yeah.  Between here and Vegas we get a lot of customers.  All types.  Even had an officer, just like you.

1 Something wrong, Jesse?	No.  Something wrong with you Dwayne?
2 You walked in here looking like you just ate a shit sandwich.	Well, I just got a lot of things on my mind is all.

1 You shut your mouth you son of a bitch!	Dwayne put the gun down --
2 Shut up!!!  Slut!!!

1 What the hell are you doing, you crazy some bitches --	We're gonna talk.

1 This whole place?	Yeah.  Figured you could have it.

1 What the hell is that?	Those are five hundred dollar chips.
2 Did you give me five-hundred dollar chips because I'm black?	No, I just assumed...
3 You assumed a brother coming in here can only afford five-hundred dollars a roll, is that right?  Are you a racist?	No, sir.
4 Everyone else at the table has thousand dollar chips, but the black man gets the nickel, is that it?  Did my people survive two-hundred years of slavery so you could send us back to the cotton fields with five-hundred dollar chips? Do I look like Chicken George to you?

1 You see, no bomb.  Now stay away before I throw you both in jail for obstruction.	Throw us in jail?  I'm about to bust you right now.
2 I'm an undercover agent for the United States Secret Service.	How do we know you're not lying?  Let me see your badge.

1 Oh, you American?	That's right.
2 You bring American money?	Never leave home without it.  Lee, this one's on me.  You save your money.

1 I'll meet you at the bar in ten minutes. They don't like tourists in here, so try to blend in.	Blend in?  I'm two feet taller than everyone here.  Where you going?
2 Bathroom.

1 What are you doing?	She said I could pick any girl I want.
2 Well, hurry up.	Hey!  You don't break in front of a black man in a buffet line.

1 So are you getting on the plane or not?!	What?
2 Come on, we still got time to order the Kosher meal.  Always get the kosher meal, they bring it first.	I cannot go to LA...

1 What's she doing?	Oh, sweet glory hallelujah...
2 I don't want to hear this.	Skirt just came off.  She's in black bra and panties -- Victoria Secret Spring Catalogue, page 27 -- wait a sec - there's a tattoo on her left thigh... it looks like Snoopy.
3 Snoopy?  I love Snoopy.	She just took her hair down.  Now she's going for the bra -- the clasp is in front -- she's using both hands.  You better get that ice.

1 I'm not used to having a partner.	We are not partners.  Between your daddy, my daddy, and the beating I just took, as far as I can tell all partners get you is dead.
2 Well we're not friends.	You got that right.  And we ain't brothers.  Maybe we should just end this right here.
3 Fine with me.	I won't talk to you, you don't talk to me.  We'll die in peace.
4 See you in the next world.	I don't believe in reincarnation.  So I won't see you in the next world.
5 Fine.	I believe in heaven.  You people believe in heaven?
6 Yes.  We have heaven.	Is it the same heaven, or is it a Chinese heaven?
7 What's a Chinese heaven?	I thought it might be like those five foot and under basketball leagues.  They don't let everybody in.
8 I think we should stop talking.	Fine by me.
9 You thinking about that girl that dumped you?	No.
10 If she was the right girl, you'd be thinking about her.	Mind your own business.
11 How was the sex?	There was no sex.  She was very traditional.  We were waiting until we were married.
12 You're kidding.  No sex?  Nothing?  No mu-shu?	No mu-shu.
13 What about a little king pao chicken?	No kung pao chicken.  Never.
14 Steamed dumplings?	Once in a while, steamed dumplings.  But only when she was drunk.
15 That's rough, man.  If I don't get steamed dumplings once a week, I go crazy.	Tell me the truth, Carter.  Do you think I have a good voice?
16 Are you serious?	Forget it.  It doesn't matter.

1 Carter...here comes the rich white man.	Wait here.  I'll handle this.

1 I saw that.  She kissed you, didn't she? You played it cool, though.  Walking away, never looking back.	She's going home to New York.  I need some ice.

1 It wasn't hard to spot the fakes until this past year.  Then Tan got hold of one of a kind Swiss made hundred dollar plates -- and started making superbills.	And Hu Li killed him for the plates.
2 Yes.  They've printed and shipped one hundred million dollars, and there's only one way to spot a fake.

1 What are you doing hanging out with Baby Duck?	Baby Duck?
2 That's what we all used to call him when he was a kid -- cause he was always quacking.  Never shut up.

1 You're just like your father, Lee.  All these years hiding behind his badge.  I wanted to help him, to share with him, but he was too afraid of change.  When you think about it, I didn't really kill him.  I just put him out of his misery.	Put the plates down.  It's over.
2 I don't think it's over.  There are casinos all over this country.  Let me make you a rich man, Lee.  Don't make the same mistake he did.

1 Lee!  It's him!	The first drop will be made tomorrow. At twelve o'clock.  The amount will be fifty million.
2 Fifty million!  Are we talkin' United States dollars?	In used currency.  Nothing bigger than a fifty.
3 That's some serious poundage in dollars.

1 Beach Boy.	You're shittin' me.  You know the Beach Boys?!
2 Beach Boy America.  Help me Rhonda, help me get her out of my --

1 You make the plate?	What plate?
2 The license!  You get it?!	No.
3 What the hell kinda cop are you?!	Did you make the plate?!
4 It was my ass that almost got trashed!	He was trying to kill me, not you.
5 Yeah, sure, you got lots a enemies in L.A. after what?  Six hours?	It was a man I was after in Hong Kong.
6 Bullshit!  You were trying' to lose my ass again.

1 You want more?	No, no.  I'm full. Too much fin and hump, you know, gives me gas.  scuse me.

1 Like that.	I am sorry, but I have too much respect for women.

1 Yeah...beautiful. What would you call that paper there? Kind of a...Robin egg blue color?	Good. That's standard military packaging for plastique. Get a look under it.

1 Jesus...what do you want?	This whole thing is goin' down tonight. I need to know where the Ambassador is gonna be. The Feds will be keepin' a lid on everything. You thing you can do that?
2 This is my city. I'm a cop. I'll find em.	Alright, Johnson, thank you.  So...what are you wearing?

1 What do you mean you lost him?! How could you lose him?!	Try a bus load of - no, make that two bus loads of Chinese --

1 Okay, look, we're gonna make a trade. You cross the street, leave her on the sidewalk.  I will leave him on this side.  Then we trade places.  You get him, I get her.  Get the picture, Lois?	Do it!

1 I would like one of my people to help.	Ambassador, let me assure you that the FBI has made this a top priority. We have plenty of manpower on the case.
2 He is very good.	As I said, sir, we've got all the people we need.

1 Yes.	Let me take you back inside, okay?

1 He wanted to know how you used to like your eggs.	Weird.  Like after all those years you would remem--

1 Fully.  I like her.  She has wit.	I left four messages.  You don't return my calls.
2 So?  I never returned your calls, even when we were married.  And what's Fisher doing here anyway?

1 Look, he's running after her.	Look, he's in pretty good shape.
2 Poor Ike.

1 No... They're interesting guys.  Each one of these guys has something going for him.  I mean, one's been up Everest. Another's become a priest.  One's a pretty good guitar player.  And this guy today tried to end world hunger, if you can believe that...	Whoa, Ike.  Getting a complex, buddy?

1 It's okay.  There's no microphone. You're no fun.	No, I'm not.

1 You should thank Lou and I for the wedding car -- a '63 Buick.	Thank you.
2 Oh, come on.  You're practically family.

1 Did something happen to make you care about reality?	Yes.  Conviction.  Conviction that I'm onto the truth.  You're going to do the same thing to "poor bastard number four" that you did to the last three.  You're going to run again.  And I'm not leaving until you do.
2 You're going to be very disappointed.	We'll see.
3 I'd love to stay and chat, but I've got to get back to work.  I still have my job.

1 You're welcome.  Your notes made interesting bedtime reading -- if you like trashy fiction.  Your observations are distorted, ungrounded an incomplete. You must be very proud.	I'm not a boastful man.  What's your point?

1 I don't know.	You don't know.
2 No.	Maybe you should ask her some time. Ever thought of that?

1 Kind of isolated.	Yeah.  It's kind of nice.

1 I love you.  I love you.	I love you, too.

1 So -- Mag -- you've seen this, huh?	Yes, I've seen it.  And I have to say it's the rudest and most offensive... joke anybody's ever played on me!

1 You're right.  It's not funny now. Maybe we both grew up.	Thanks.  Will you fix my hair?

1 I'm really rooting for this one.	Thank you, Dad.

1 Don't touch them.  I feel terrible sneezing at a time like this.  This is a big moment for me --	He's allergic to everything, don't worry about it --

1 Becky heard this woman on the radio complaining about this guy she was sure was Rick, which meant he was cheating on her.  She was completely hysterical.  Then it turned out the woman lived in Duluth.	That doesn't make any sense.
2 I know.  It makes no sense at all.  Thank God my life is in place.

1 You should write something about this.	About what?
2 Whatever it is.

1 I thought I would look into doing a story about those radio shows.	You'd probably have to go somewhere to really look into it.
2 Definitely.

1 I need to know about him because... he's involved with my sister...	Okay.
2 She has a pattern of getting involved with losers... Once she almost ran away with a human cannonball from the circus.	Do you want a matrimonial, past wives, any kids--
3 No, I know that part --	So you want a financial, is he a deadbeat, we can do a D&B --
4 No, no, no, it's more like, who is he, does he have a sense of humor, is he nice -- no forget nice, I've got nice --	A sense of humor.
5 I'll tell you the truth, I heard this guy on a call-in radio show and I might not marry the person I should marry because I've become obsessed with him.	Oh.  Like Glenn Close in that movie.
6 No.  Not remotely.  I just want to find out about him.	You want a tail.  I got a guy in Seattle --

1 Everybody! Annie has an announcement --	Walter and I are engaged!

1 It's you.	It's me?
2 The one in the street.  I chased after you.

1 Do you think there's somebody out there you could love as much as your wife? Maybe even more?	It's hard to imagine.

1 Just because someone's looking for a nice guy doesn't make them desperate.	How about rapacious and love- starved?
2 No.	It is easier to be killed by a terrorist --
3 It is not --	Right, right.

1 I can hear you walking around sometimes.  At first I thought it was a robber.  Go ahead, tell her, Dad.	I don't think I have to now.

1 How did they get our phone number?	You have to give them your phone number or they won't let you go on the air.

1 Listen to this --	Not now, Jonah --
2 Just this one part, okay?  "I have been an excellent third-baseman for as long as I or anyone else can remember, and I guarantee you will not get one past me"	Jonah, I'm leaving --
3 WAIT!!!  -- "and while we're on the subject, let's just say right now that Brooks Robinson was the best third baseman ever. It's important that you agree with me on that because I'm from Baltimore."  Dad, she thinks Brooks Robinson is the greatest.

1 God, she's beautiful.	Victoria? She's okay.

1 Maybe we'll get a dog when we get back.	Okay.
2 What do you mean, okay? Wouldn't you like a dog?	Sure.

1 How's Jonah taking it?	It'll take him a while to come around.  A month ago he called one of those radio call-in shows and told them I needed a wife --
2 You're kidding --	Now that I'm seeing someone, it's a whole other thing.

1 Want to go up to your office, Mr. Alexander?	Naturally. You think I parked here for a cup of coffee?
2 You're welcome to one.	No thanks.
3 The men would like to know who this gentleman is.	That's none of their affair.

1 How goes it?	It never ends.

1 To the mine?	Sure. Where they're negotiating. In the company office. We'll go up there and picket the place.

1 We did. It got lost in the shuffle.	What?
2 We can't get everything at once. Right now we've got more important demands.	What's more important than sanitation?
3 The safety of the men -- that's more important! Five accidents this week -- all because of speed-up. You're a woman, you don't know what it's like up there.

1 Not just Juanito. You'll have it good too, Esperanza. We're going to win this strike.	What makes you so sure?
2 Because if we lose, we lose more than a strike. We lose the union. And the men know this. And if we win, we win more than a few demands. We win...  ... something bigger. Hope. Hope for our kids. Juanito can't grow strong on milk alone.

1 We've got to have a talk, you and me.	All right, but later. I've got a meeting now.
2 A meeting?	Yes. To plan for the picket line tomorrow.

1 Hear those deputies slugged 'Cente.	Yeah. Lots of provocation lately. They figure if they can lock up the leadership on some phony riot charge, maybe they can bust the strike.

1 And another thing. Your attitude toward Anglos. If you're gonna be a leader ...	What attitude?
2 You lump them all together -- Anglo workers and Anglo bosses.	He's a guest in my house, isn't he?
3 Sure. But you want the truth? You're even suspicious of him.	Maybe. I think he's got a few things to learn about our people.

1 Yeah, but he was in silhouette.	How about in the house?
2 They were wearing ski masks. I told you all of this.	Did you see his hair color?
3 No, Why?

1 What about the guy on the very bottom?	Leave me out of this.
2 That bad, huh?

1 : What are you up to?	Nothing.
2 What do you want from me, Colette?	I don't want anything. Why are you so suspicious?
3 It gets me through the day.	You really need to lighten up.

1 No. I want to know what the hell is going on.	I can't tell you.

1 Who is it?	It's Tom.

1 That's a good one.	I'm serious, dude.  You always seem to be on top of things, even when you're tweakin'.
2 I guess there's just no substitute for good genes.

1 You know, Jimmy, you might as well put a sign on the back of this thing asking the cops to pull you over.	You mean, like to throw 'em off?
2 Yeah, that's what I mean.  Where the hell does this guy live anyway?	Palmdale
3 Why do they call him Pooh-Bear?	I think on account of his nose.
4 You're going to have to explain that one.	He doesn't have one.
5 You're going to have to give me a little more than that, Jimmy.

1 What?	I'm not a tweaker.  I don't use drugs. I never had.

1 You don't understand.	Understand what?

1 Come on, guys ...	Big Bill.

1 Cool it. We got business.	Yeah, dickhead.

1 If he finds out it's me, I'm a dead man.	Danny, he isn't gonna find out it's you.  Domingo was a slinger, he must have sold to hundreds of different people.

1 That's because he doesn't have one.	Whata you mean?  He told me -
2 Guy scores dope and dollar from ripping off other drug dealers.  As least that's what the word is.	What's to stop him from just ripping me off then?
3 That's probably what he would have done if we hadn't found out about your get-rich-quick scheme.

1 Then why didn't you help the kid when you were there?	Hey, you want me to do all your work for you, numbnuts?

1 Excuse me?	Several possession charges, but nothing major.
2 Why doesn't Palmdale P.D. just raid the guy?	They have. But they never found a lab.

1 Why didn't you just ask for directions back there?	Come on, where's your pioneer spirit?
2 You mean like the Donner Party?	Hey, do you think you could eat me if you had to?  And if so, which part do you think you would find the most delicious?
3 Tom, quit fucking around.	Okay, okay.  There's a house up there. I'll go ask for directions.

1 Where's Bubba?	Maybe he isn't showing.

1 I'm Jackson.  I'm from West Fork, Tennessee.  My pappy's a preacher. Him and his two brothers got a ministry, The Blessed Church of the Wandering Gospel.	In West Fork?
2 In the back of a nineteen and thirty- one stretch Hudson with a big ole' trailer.	No kidding.
3 I don't make jokes about things of, or related to, the preaching of the Holy Gospel, including the ministerial calling of my family.	So they travel around from place to place and preach?
4 We got us a tent, forty-two feet across, eighteen feet at center, hundred-and-ten foldin' chairs. Circuit's eleven towns, covers all 'a Hasset County and most 'a Weller County.  I expect that upon completion of my military service I will be joinin' said ministry.	What about the Captain?  Where's he from?

1 You know what the best possible thing that could happen is?	Yep, you step on a rusty nail, get lockjaw, never say another word as long as you live.

1 Me?  I'm walking with my hound, Lucy, it's about an hour 'fore sunrise and we're out huntin' coon.  I got me a flask of pure Kentucky mash whiskey...	Jackson, how many times I got to tell you, you're from Tennessee.
2 I am, but I like imported whiskey. So there I am and I hear the biggest ole' coon you ever did hear, 'a rustlin' right there in front of me. That ole' boy comes right out of the brush, I got a clear shot and he knows he's 'bout to meet his maker. I aim, I got my finger tight on the trigger and then I just smile and say to that ole' coon, go on, now, you get out 'a here.  Then I sit down on a hollow log and take me a right long pull a' that mash whiskey.

1 I'm in my backyard, lying in my hammock, with my arm around my wife, listening for the sound of breaking glass.	Say what, Cap'n?
2 You see, I've got the best house in all of Addley.  It's not the biggest house, but it's got the best location, right next to the junior high baseball field.  The garage windows face left field.  The guy who owned the house before me had these heavy screen S put over them.  The first thing I did when I bought the place was take off those screens.  Two-hundred-twenty- two yards from home plate to my garage windows.  It takes a hell of a junior high kid to hit a ball that far.  I look at my garage windows as a Motivator and a way to scout the kids coming up, the ones who are going to give us a shot at the state championship.  I lay there in my hammock and every time I hear the sound of breaking glass, I know we're one step closer to winning it all.	Don't that get kind of expensive, Cap'n?
3 It's worth it.	To each, his own.

1 It looks like a Renoir.	Yes.  Do you know Sibelius' Fourth Symphony, The Normandy?
2 I've been humming it.	I heard.
3 It seemed appropriate.	You know classical music?
4 Some.	Where are you from, Captain?

1 Upham, you've got to learn the difference between whining and griping.  You can't just rely on natural ability, you've got to study and practice.	But, sir...
2 There you go again, that's whining, that's not okay.	Goddamn it, sir...
3 That's better, but you've still got a long way to go.  Talk to Reiben, he's a natural and works at it, he'll give you some pointers.

1 Uh, Captain...	PUSH!
2 Uh, Captain...

1 How about...?	How about you shut up and take your position?

1 What do you think?	Well, if we had ten times the men and a lot more ammo, we might stand a chance, but not against those tanks.
2 What are we going to do?	We're going to hope like hell the tanks were on their way somewhere else.

1 Captain, I gotta tell you, the irony of this mission is fucking killing me.	Yeah, how so?
2 I should be on my way to Caen, sir. It's like Beethoven, the guy's one of the greatest composers ever lived and he goes deaf.  Go figure, I mean, who'd he piss off?  And here I am, the Beethoven of ladies foundation garments, one step away from Caen, the center of the known lingerie universe and instead, I'm going to Ramelle to save some fucking private who's probably already dead.	There's to be a bright side, look for it.
3 Sir, you know what Ramelle is famous for?  Cheese.  The rest of the company is going to Caen and we're going to the goddamned cheese capital of France.  There is no bright side.	There's always a bright side.
4 I'm listening, sir.	Well, I, for one, like cheese.

1 Up.  We're moving out.	I thought you said we had an hour, sir?
2 Well now I'm saying we're moving out.  Get off your ass.

1 What deal?	I coach the baseball team, too.

1 Don't do that again.	I won't need to sir, it's already here, behind the barricade so...

1 Wade's right, it's some kind of scientific, magnetic thing, I can't explain it, but I've seen it.	We all have, he's got nine lives, or he's bulletproof, or some damn thing.

1 On guard, glancing back.  Pissed off.	Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...
2 Freaked out.  Trying to keep his eyes on the perimeter.  Can't.

1 Thanks, I like yours too.	Listen, I don't know your name, but what are you doing for lunch?

1 Hello Constance.  It's me, Lloyd... nothing, I'm just driving around... she broke up with me... what do I do?  Can't she come back?  How can I get her back?... I can't think, talk to me... I fucked up... I feel like crying... she gave me a pen.  I gave her my heart and she gave me a pen.	Lloyd, honey, just come home, okay?
2 I'll be home soon.

1 What does it say?	Read it.

1 "Dear Diane, I'll always be there for you, all the love in my heart, Lloyd."  I've never gotten a letter like this, have you?	I dream about it.

1 Ha!	Well, it's almost over.  We've gone to school together for three years, and we've been through a lot.  But with that training out of High School gone, what's going to happen to us?  We all know what the answers are.  We want to be happy, go to college, own a car, maybe raise a family.  But what if that doesn't happen?  I have, I have to be honest though, I have all the hope and ambition in the world.  But when I think about the future, the truth is, I am really...scared.

1 She's not the world's greatest flyer, let me tell you.  When she was eight years old, she...	Dad.
2 Now why can't I tell the story?

1 Dad, in a million years, I would never give him a pen.  What's wrong with having some fun?  I like him.	'I like him'?  Diane, I'm talking about being honest with people, being decent...
2 Dad, I love him.

1 Alright.  This is really great.  Alright, we're going out. It's a date.  It's a scam.  Whatever, whatever, alright, I'll pick you up at what, eight O' clock?	Eight.
2 Eight. Eight O' clock.	Goodbye.
3 Goodbye.

1 Thanks.  But either way it still feels...	Twisted?
2 You know what?	What?
3 You're a great date.  I've never really gone out with someone as basic as you.	Basic.  Hmmm.
4 So what's your job this summer?	Job?  Being a great date.
5 No, I'm serious.	So am I. I want to see you again.  I want to see you as much as I can before you leave.  I said it.
6 I only have something like sixteen weeks.	Sixteen weeks is a long time.
7 Then call me tomorrow.	Today is tomorrow.
8 Then call me later.

1 It's okay, everybody does that.	I just don't want it to get too heavy.  I feel really overloaded. I have this theory of convergence, that good things always happen with bad things.  But I know you have to deal with them at the same time, but I just, I mean I don't know why they have to happen at the same time, I mean, I don't know why, I just wish I could work out... Am I just babbling?  Do you know what I mean?
2 No.	I just can't have any social life right now.
3 Don't worry about it.  We're just having coffee.  We'll be anti- social.	Be friends?
4 Yeah.  With potential.	Friends with potential.

1 I'm fine.	Okay, good, this is all very noble.

1 Why don't I just get your phone number, that's usually how it works.	Oh.  Okay then... Lloyd Dobler, 555-1342.

1 Diane Court.	Dude, I can't do it!

1 We finally graduated, big dude guy!	Alright!

1 It's not a charade, all this?	A charade?  How could it be a charade?

1 I go to work the other day, there's nobody there.  Nobody tells me about this, I have to find out, I have to go in, everybody's gone -	They're not gone, they're here.
2 They're mine!

1 If you admit to making three, then it's four, actually.  But how?	I just told you.
2 You did, but you didn't.

1 You have any idea what a shirt like this costs?	Nice things cost money.

1 That'd be fine.	Done.  Lets not talk about it anymore, let's have a good time.

1 I could try to read this or I could eat my lunch while it's till hot.  We're doing well?	Yes.
2 Better this month than last?	Yes.
3 Any reason to think next month will be worse?	The war could end.

1 Eight hundred, give or take.	Give or take what, Stern - how many - count them.

1 It's got nothing to do with reality, Oskar, I know it and you know it, it's a matter of national priority to these guys.  It's got a ritual significance to them, Jews shoveling snow.	I lost a day of production.  I lost a worker.  I expect to be compensated.
2 File a grievance with the Economic Office, it's your right.	Would it do any good?
3 No.

1 We don't know if it's random. We haven't been able to connect the victims.	The first two were stabbed without thought. The sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision.

1 Don't do that. Hang up...call...	What? I can't hear you...
2 Hang up...call...	I'm losing you.
3 ...campus security...send someone...check out...place...	Okay, okay. I'll call now. I'll call you back.

1 I get my revenge and make some fast cash.	Its over, Cotton.
2 Not until youre dead.

1 How do you put up with this Greek shit?	Hey, it's cool. Hallie's into it, I'm into Hallie...

1 This is exactly what I don't want.	I think it's out of your control.

1 He seemed harmless.	Aren't most serial killers seemingly harmless?

1 Yes, Miss Weathers, your name is embedded clearly between my ears.	I see you read the book.
2 Yes, I do retain reading skills. Shock.	And an explanation is, of course, out of the question.
3 Page 32. "Deputy Dewey filled the room with his dim-witted Barney Fifish presence." I think you've explained yourself.	Oh Dewey, I'm sorry.
4 No, what you are is a money hungry, fame- seeking liar and--forgive me for saying-- mediocre writer who has a cold storage shed where her heart should be.

1 This is all too familiar.	Over here.

1 Who is this?	I'll give you one guess.

1 Someones trying to kill me. I need the police.	Are you in danger now?
2 Yes, goddammit!	Where is your attacker?
3 I dont know.	Stay under the safety light. Help is on its way.
4 The safety what? Fuck that!

1 Okay, you're sure about skipping Calculas?	Please, I have the perfect excuse.
2 What about rehearsal?	Gotta.
3 I'll cover you through rehearsal. Derek when do you get outta docu- drama?

1 The Ghost advances on the young girl, grabbing her, pulling her to him, raising high a long, hunting knife. The young girl is helpless...	Maureen looks at Phil, confused...as if seeing for the first time...IT'S NOT PHIL. She pulls away when, the Ghost-masked Figure grabs her with one hand, the other one clutching the hunting knife. Maureen sees it, her mouth billowing forth a LOUD SCREAM That is matched by the entire audience as they SCREAM at the screen.

1 ..this week's TKE kegger...	Ne ask that you sell individual squares of toilet paper for a mere nickel a piece.
2 We've set you each at a five dollar quota.

1 Come on, baby. Lighten up a little, will ya?	I get scared really easy, okay.
2 You gotta go with it. Scary movies are great foreplay.

1 No, Jennifer Love Hewitt. Of course it's me, silly. And I feel like an ass standing in this theater lobby all by myself. Where are you babe, the movie starts in twenty minutes.	Look, I'm stuck on the freeway. I think there was some big accident. It could be a little while so I don't want you to start freaking if I don't get there at exactly,  Eight thirty.
2 All I'm saying is I'm gonna be royally p.o.'d if you don't catch my acting debut.	Oh I wouldn't miss it for the world. I bet you did such a great job.
3 I did. Hon, although I got a total of six minutes screen time, they're the best six minutes of the movie.	Heh heh I bet they are babe. I bet they are. Look, my battery's dying . . .

1 Can I help you?	I'm Gale Weathers, author of the Woodsboro and Windsor College murders, and anchorwoman for TOTAL ENTERTAINMENT. Maybe you've heard of me?

1 Who?	I'm not at liberty to tell you that Miss Weathers. You're no longer working with the L.A.P.D. I don't even know why you're standing in here right now. By all means I should have you thrown out.
2 But you won't. You're a good man detective. We think alike. I know you need my help. And I know you know I need your help.	In my fifteen years as a homicide detective I've never met a single soul as pushy and brazen as you are Miss Weathers.
3 Please, call me Gale.	Deal, but I'm still Detective Kincaid,ok?

1 That's fine Mr. Rielly, but if anyone else should die, I'm going to have to get a warrant.	Understood.  If you'll excuse me Detective.  Gale.

1 I was afraid they were bait, something to, ya know,  trick you out of hiding.	Listen, Detective, I wanna see this studio where all this shit's going down.

1 Dewey, personal lives and pasts aside, this is about Sidney. We need to know where she is.	What so you can just exploit her again with another book? Sid doesn't need you Gale.
2 Show him.

1 Paternity test results. Christ Dewey, you're never going to believe who Milton's kid is.	Who is it?

1 Shit! Where the hell are Tom and Angelina?	I don't know. Screw them. Look, what's important is that we stick together. No matter what. If anyone is next it's you or me Jen.

1 Excuse me Detective, I think we have some business to attend to.	GALE WEATHERS?! What are you doing here? No press on the set!  No press, no press on set! Get that woman out of here.

1 Gale he's got Dewey!	I know! He killed Kincaid!
2 I know!	Let's get out of here!
3 GALE WATCHOUT!

1 If you lay a hand on him I'll fucking kill you!	Great. A spirited one. I'll be seeing you real soon Sidney. Real soon.

1 What? She asked.	It's called tact, you fuckrag.
2 Sorry.

1 Think about it. On the off chance I get caught -- a motive like that could divide a jury for years, don't you think?. You took my mother, so I took yours. Big sympathy factor. Maternal abandonment causes serious deviant behavior. It certainly fucked you up. It made you have sex with a psychopath.	That's right and now that you're no longer a virgin. You gotta die -- those are the rules.

1 Thank you, Hank. We're on it. What were you doing out at Sidney's tonight?	I just wanted to see her, that's all.
2 You rode your bike out there?	Yes, sir.
3 And last night? Sidney said you crawled through her window last night too?

1 No... I don't... it's just... Oh God, Billy, someone was there, someone tried to kill me.	The police say I scared him off. It wasn't me, Sid.
2 I know. He called again last night at Tatum's house.	See, it couldn't have been me. I was in jail, remember?
3 I'm so sorry... please understand.	Understand what? That I got a girlfriend who would rather accuse me of being a psychopathic killer than touch me.
4 You know that's not true.	Then what is it? Is there somebody else?
5 No...	Is it the sex thing? Am I being too pushy?
6 No, it's me, Billy. I need time. I'm still adjusting to my mom.	It's been a year since she died.
7 Tomorrow. One year tomorrow.	When are you gonna let that go, Sid? When my mom left my dad -- I just accepted it. This is the way it is. She's not coming back.
8 Your parents split up. It's not the same thing. Your mom left town, she's not in a coffin somewhere.	You have to move on, Sid.

1 It's called GUESS HOW I'M GOING TO DIE!	Fuck you.
2 We already played that game. You lost, remember?

1 Hello.	Why don't you want to talk to me?
2 Who is this?	You tell me your name, I'll tell you mine.
3 I don't think so.	What's that noise?

1 I'm two seconds from calling the police.	They'd never make it in time.

1 Please don't do this...	Come on. It'll be fun.
2 No... please.	It's an easy category. Movie trivia.
3 ...please...	I'll even give you a warm up question.
4 Don't do this. I can't...	Name the killer in HALLOWEEN.
5 No...	Come on. It's you favorite scary movie, remember? He had a white mask, he stalked the baby-sitters.

1 Don't make me... I can't... I won't.	Your call.

1 People treat me like the Antichrist of television journalism.	I don't think you're so bad.

1 You gonna be able to come down to the station and talk to us a bit?	...yeah...

1 I was first to respond.	What were you doing out here?
2 Drive by patrol.	How is she?
3 She's tough.	Have to be. The shit she's gone through.

1 Casey! Casey!	Not my daughter... not my...

1 Off the record. No cameras.	Forget it.

1 I have no idea.	Scary night, isn't it? With the murders and all, it's like right out of a horror movie or something.
2 Aha, Randy, you gave yourself away. Are you calling from work? Tatum's on her way over.	Do you like scary movies, Sidney?
3 I like that thing you're doing with your voice, Randy. It's sexy.	What's your favorite scary movie?
4 Don't start. You know I don't watch that shit.	And why is that?
5 Because they're all the same. It's always some stupid killer stalking some big breasted girl -- who can't act -- who always runs up the stairs when she should be going out the front door. They're ridiculous.

1 Stu was with me last night.	Oooooh... before or after he sliced and diced.
2 Fuck you, nut case. Where were you last night?	Working, thank you.
3 I thought Blockbuster fired you.	Twice.

1 Why would he want to kill his own girlfriend?	There's always some stupid bullshit reason to kill your girlfriend. That's the beauty of it all. Simplicity. Besides, if it's too complicated you lose your target audience.
2 So what's his reason?	Maybe Sidney wouldn't have sex with him.
3 She's saving herself for you.	Could be. Now that Billy's tried to mutilate her, you think Sid would go out with me?
4 I think her father did it. How come they can't find his ass?	Because he's probably dead. His body will come popping out in the last reel somewhere... eyes gauged. See, the police are always off track with this shit, if they'd watch PROM NIGHT they'd save time. There's formula to it. A very simple one. Everyone's always a suspect -- the father, the principal, the town derelict...
5 Which is you...	So while they're off investigating a dead end, Billy, who's been written off as a suspect, is busy planning his next hunting expedition.

1 Why are they doing this?	Are you kidding? This is like Christmas.

1 You sure I can stay over? My dad won't be back til Sunday.	No prob. I'll pick you up after practice.
2 Tell your mom I said thanks.	Yeah, yeah... are you okay?
3 Uh-huh, it's just... you know, the police and reporters... it brings it all back.	I'll be there by seven. I promise
4 Thanks, Tatum.	Later.

1 It was just some sick fuck having a laugh.	It was him, Tatum. I know it.

1 There's that sense of humor. I knew it still existed. Ohh, Sid, let's have some fun tonight.	Deal.

1 That's not necessary.  You're in.	Thank you.
2 Go start picking up the pieces.  We'll shuffle some paper and try to get you a new partner.

1 Already.	Greed.  It was written in blood.

1 And... and... and he said... he asked me if I was married.  And, I could see he had a gun in his hand.	Where was the girl?
2 What?  What?	Where was the prostitute?  Where was she?

1 You didn't know.	NO!

1 Here he comes.	What the fuck is going on?
2 I want you to know, I wish I could have lived like you do.

1 You think it was poison?	Guessing at this point is useless.

1 It's a package deal.  You get the phone with the office.	Detective Mills here.  Honey... I asked you not to call me here. I'll call you back...  What?  Why?

1 Gould's wife.  She was away on business. If this means she saw anything, I don't know what.  We've questioned her at least five times.	And, if it's a threat.
2 We put her in a safe house.

1 Oh, yeah, sure.  You got to be kidding?!	Just wait!

1 The way this has gone till now, I wouldn't have thought it was possible, but we may have underestimated this guy.	I want him bad.  I don't just want to catch him anymore.  I want to hurt him.
2 Listen to me.  He's all about playing games.	No kidding!  No fucking kidding!
3 We have to divorce ourselves from emotions here.  No matter how hard it is, we have to stay focused on the details.	I don't know about you, but I feed off my emotions.
4 He'll string us along all the way if we're not careful.

1 This is a waste of time.	We're focusing.
2 I know, I know... focusing on one little thing.	The Divine Comedy.  A History of Catholicism.  A book called Murderers and Madmen.

1 What are you talking about?	We had him.

1 You knew I'd say yes.	No, actually, I wasn't sure at all.

1 Tell me it's not true.	I can't let you do this...

1 You have a strange way about you... I mean interesting.  I'm sorry.  It's really none of my business.  It's just nice to meet a man who talks like that.  If David saw that paper, he'd say you're a fag.  That's how he is.	I guess I won't be showing it to him then.

1 Neighbors heard them screaming at each other for like two hours.  It was nothing new.  But, then they heard the gun go off. Both barrels.	Did the wife confess?
2 When the patrolman came she was trying put his head back together.  She was crying too hard to say anything.

1 It's all right, ma...I been watchin'... Only I wish...	What, Ben?
2 I wish Uncle Ethan was here. Don't you, ma?

1 Is this in the line of duty, sergeant?	No sir...pleasure.
2 In that case, give the boys room...

1 They're camped by the river -- 'bout twenty miles from here. Soon's it gets dark we'll circle out so's to jump 'em before day- break.	You're right sure you want to <U>jump</U> 'em, Ethan?

1 Now son, it's a bitter thing to say, but there's more than your sister at stake here.	There sure is! I'm going to tell you somethin'...I wasn't going to speak of it...But I'll tell you now. Did you notice them scalps strung on Scar's lance?  Did you see the third scalp from the point of the lance? Long... wavy hair...

1 Martin! Ride me as far as the well!	Grab hold!...

1 How'd you come by this?	You said there'd be a thousand dollar reward.
2 That's what I said.	You got it with you?

1 Nothing for you to see.	Leggo...

1 Jorgensen's been runnin' his cattle with my own...	YOUR cattle?...<U>DEBBIE'S</U> cattle!

1 <U>YOU</U> don't understand, ya chunkhead! <U>You</U> didn't buy any blanket! Ya bought <U>her</U>!	What?
2 You got yourself a <U>wife</U>, sonny!	Oh no! Tell her she's got to go back...
3 And have her whole family after our scalps for floutin' one o' their women?...No sir! Come on, Mrs. Pauley...

1 Lemme alone...	You breeds are all alike -- two drinks an'...

1 I know you are...Only it ain't goin' to be that way...she's alive...	Livin' with Comanches ain't bein' alive...
2 She's alive...Better she's alive and livin' with Comanches than her brains bashed out...

1 Every young man should at least once...Go on, Laurie! Read!	A little Comanche squaw - SQUAW!

1 She'd be about thirteen now...	We got two around that age...
2 Where?	You'll have to wait until we reach the agency...Fall in behind the column...
3 But couldn't you...?	Sorry...  Keep the column moving!..Close ranks there!

1 Hey... the fuse.	Oh, damnit!

1 Who was that?	Someone from the village.

1 "Events commonly interpreted as haunting apparitions often result from psychic disharmonies or undigested traumatic ordeals..."	Ellen, what are you trying to prove, anyway?  That we've created ourselves a ghost?  Come on!

1 Of course you'll give me the blame again.  Like back then.  Just a tiny cut and he could still be alive today - isn't that right, Ellen?	What are you talking about-

1 I really hate to bother him, but...	Oh no, no.  You're not bothering him.  He has lots of time since he's been retired.

1 And that is?	A tumor - which could cause pressure on certain parts of the brain and, thus, influence your perception.

1 Look at this.  The lock is totally demolished.	I guess someone lost their key. You did get your tetanus shots, I hope?

1 I know your face. Are you an actor?	Yes.
2 Yes, I've seen you in something. That one about a king.	Really?
3 I had the Christopher Marlowe in my boat once.

1 I swear it. He wants Romeo for Ned and the Admiral's Men.	Ned is wrong for it.

1 I have not said all. By malign fate, the message goes astray which would tell Romeo of the Friar's plan. He hears only that Juliet is dead. And thus he goes to the Apothecary.	That's me.
2 And buys a deadly poison. He enters the tomb to say farewell to Juliet who lies there cold as death. He drinks the poison. He dies by her side. And then she wakes and sees him dead.

1 Mr. Shakespeare has given me the part of the Apothecary!	The Apothecary? Will, what is the story? Where is the shipwreck? How does the comedy end?

1 Now where? Will?	To the Palace at Whitehall.

1 We are lost.	No, it will turn out well.
2 How will it?	I don't know, it's a mystery.

1 Be good to her, my lord!	I will.

1 Your Majesty	There was a wager, I rememberas to whether a play can show the very truth and nature of love. I think you lost it today.  You are an eager boy. Did you like the play?

1 "Thus from my lips, by thine, my sin is purg'd."	"Then have my lips the sin that they have took."
2 "Sin from my lips? Oh trespass sweetly urg'd. Give me my sin again."

1 Wait, you'll see the cat bites his head off.	I have to get back.

1 Oh, do not go	I must. I must

1 Will you read it for me?	"Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day> It was the nightingale and not the lark That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear. Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate tree. Believe me, love, it was the nightingale."
2 "It was the lark, the herald of the morn, No nightingale. Look, love, what envious streaks Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east. Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops. I must be gone and live, or stay and die."

1 I meanYour Majesty, they do not, they have not, but I believe there is one who can	Lady Viola isyoung in the world. Your Majesty is wise in it. Nature and truth are the very enemies of playacting. I'll wager my fortune.

1 "Poet?"	I was a poet till now, but I have seen beauty that puts my poems at one with the talking ravens at the Tower.

1 I don't want to devalue your victory, but I just want you to know: I wasn't trying to win.	Victory is the same as defeat. It's giving in to destructive competitive urges.
2 You learn that in your psychotherapy group?	Discussion group, Alex, discussion.

1 Family? Family? Friends? Drugged-up wandering suicidal search of the self fuck-ups don't have families, David.	I just thought we should discuss it.
2 Take his legs.

1 What is this?	Security.
2 From what? Jehovah's Witnesses?	There was a break-in.
3 Downstairs, I know. Pensioner's terror ordeal: page six.

1 No, can't think of anything else that matters.	About the mail --
2 It's very kind of you to offer, but --	Where do you think you'll go?
3 Where will we go? Where will we go? Juliet?

1 What?	Nothing. We thought you were someone else.

1 So we'll meet him, then?	What? Oh, yeah, sure, if you want. I tell you, every letter this guy writes to you is the same: they all begin like pure love and descend into open pornography. I dream of your thighs, the soft touch of your white skin leading me in desire, while I, aroused and inflamed --'

1 Who's going to do it?	I thought we all were.
2 I don't thinkI can.	But you're a doctor. You kill people every day.
3 I don't want to. It's different.	And now you tell me.

1 Is this the same stuff you made last week?	No, no, it's different.
2 I hope it tastes better than the other stuff.	It tastes different.
3 I don't want it to taste different. I don't know why I bother. Is that enough for you? Hey!

1 You'll wait in the hall?	I'll wait there.
2 And if it sounds like I'm being killed, you'll phone the police, you'll tell them everything?	Everything.
3 Everything. Except maybe that it was his idea and not mine in the first place. OK? That's important to me. I need to die misunderstood.	Alex.
4 What?	As smart as you are, you'll need a little help.

1 Can you afford this place?	Yeah.

1 It's just that you strike me as a man trapped in a crisis of emotional direction, afflicted by a realization that the partner of your dreams is, quite simply, just that.	Did you ever kill a man?

1 I'm sorry.	I should hope so.

1 It's nice.	Would you like to see the rest?

1 Offering it for debate.	It's like recognizing criminals by their crimes.

1 -- yes, Senator -- just a minute, dear --	Lester, don't you think that uhh --

1 She's got a...	Does she have a pancreatic ulcer?
2 Yeah, I think so.	That's very serious. Who's her doctor?
3 I don't know.	Gee, that's very serious...
4 I know.	Ruth Lesserman had a pancreatic ulcer.
5 She did?	It turned out to be cancer.
6 Wow.	So what are you doing going over there? You're not her doctor.
7 I've gotta give her some pills. Percodan, she ran out.

1 -- Anyway.	I hope she's all right.
2 She's fine. You really think I'd be a good investment?	I wouldn't say so if I didn't.
3 No, I know.	And I certainly wouldn't tell Lester.
4 I know.	I mean it or I wouldn't say it.
5 That's great. You look great, baby, great. Dennis, look at Felicia's hair.

1 Well, is she your girlfriend?	No.
2 Are you in love with her?	Her?
3 Are you?	No.
4 Then it's not your problem.	It isn't?
5 No. You know too many sick ladies.	I guess so.
6 How do you expect to get anything done if you allow yourself to get sidetracked? Particularly in your business... you deal with women every day...	I guess so.
7 Don't worry, honey, I'll protect you.	Okay.
8 God, I adore you.

1 Right now?	Yeah.

1 -- Listen, I'm supposed to take Jill to El Cholo tonight. She's really going to be pissed if I don't.	-- Maybe she'll come with us. If I tell her how important it is to me, I don't think she'll mind. Do you?
2 I don't know. Probably not.	Jill's really great, isn't she?
3 Great... so how's everything with you?

1 Bernstein... seemed to think I hated men.	Do you? You still see him?

1 No! Don't! Please!	I don't want to... I swear...

1 -- don't you want to --	Jackie, can we --
2 Who's the greatest cocksucker in the world? C'mon --

1 What's wrong?	-- do you want ice?

1 Do you know what that Lillian Bercovici just did?	No, man.
2 -- Right after I sprayed her?	What?
3 She touched it! Then she played in it and got it all into something else. Now I don't know what it is!

1 Nothing, my sister's back from Vegas.	That's too bad.
2 I have to see you.	Hey, stop by the shop.

1 Honey?	Yeah, baby.
2 Why am I great?

1 When?	When I get off work.
2 When is that?	I'll call you.
3 When is that, George?	I'll call you.
4 But I never know when you're working and when you're not working!	Neither do I, baby.
5 What?	Nothing, I'll call you, okay?
6 ... Okay...

1 Didn't you, baby?	Let go of me.

1 I wish you'd go now.	That's all you've got to say?
2 -- yes.	-- tell me something -- did you talk about me?
3 George...	Did you?
4 Please!... that's not like you.	Yeah, I know. Did you?
5 George, now cut this out.	Did you?
6 Stop it.	Did you?
7 Yes, yes, I did.	What did you say?
8 George, if you keep this up I'm going to scream.	What did you say?
9 George...	What did you say?
10 I said you were a loser!

1 Well, George, you may not think ten or fifteen grand means much to me, but I invest for myself and a lot of particular people.	Oh yeah? I mean I know.
2 So I'm going to want a little more of your thinking on the subject.

1 Well anyway...	Your hair looks -- well fabulous.

1 Hell of a way to treat a business partner, that's all I can say.	Who?
2 Me!	Hey, you were never going to give me the money.
3 I was gonna give you the money. Probably I was. Shit, I don't know, I don't know anything anymore.

1 I called to tell you I was sending one over but the line was busy, you're always on the phone.	I am?
2 Who were you talking to?	Who do you think I was talking to?
3 My secretary saw you with that boy.	Steve?
4 Whatever his name is, that actor.

1 They get hair all over the place.	They're Yorkies and they don't shed.

1 I am? I mean why?	Oh, honey, don't be totally naive.
2 I'm not. Maybe I am.	No, listen. He's a very good hairdresser.

1 I'm terribly sorry.	-- never mind.
2 What does he do? Is he an actor?	-- no.
3 Good for you.	He's a hairdresser.

1 Now I didn't mean that, you rat.	Two weeks from tomorrow.
2 You're going?	You're going.

1 Look, is there somewhere else you'd rather go? Maybe we can change our location.	No, it's not that...
2 Do you have children?	No.
3 Are you married?	No.
4 Do you have something against traveling?	No.

1 There were a party of settlers in the covered wagon times.  They got snowbound one winter in the mountains.  They had to resort to cannabilism in order to stay alive.	You mean they ate each other up?
2 They had to, in order to survive.

1 You don't?  Well what's your favorite food then?	French Fries and Ketchup.

1 No I ain't.	Mr. Halloran, what is in Room 237?
2 Nothing.  There ain't nothing in Room 237, but you ain't got no business going in there anyway, so stay out!  You understand, stay out!

1 Oh what a Maze.  Isn't it beautiful.	Yeah.

1 Mommy!	Oh!

1 Have you been in Boulder long, Mrs. Torrance?	Only about three months.  Eh we're from Vermont.  My husband was teaching school there.
2 Did the appearance of Danny's imaginary friend...?

1 Ah ha, it's coming off now, sir.	Eh... Mr. Grady... weren't you once the caretaker here?
2 Why no, sir.  I don't believe so.

1 I'd be glad to do that, sir.  Oh why don't you call me back in about eh twenty minutes?	Thank you very much.  I'll do that.
2 All right, sir.

1 No, we don't mind.	Good.
2 Sound good to you, Danny?

1 No charge?	Your money's no good here.

1 Any ideas yet?	Lots of ideas.  No good ones.

1 You went into the room Danny said - to 237?	Yes, I did.
2 And you didn't see anything at all?	Absolutely nothing.  How is he?

1 Of course I am.	Of course you are.

1 I'll bring back a doctor.	Wendy...
2 I'm gonna go now.	Wendy...

1 I don't believe they did.	Well, my predecessor in this job

1 even before anybody knew what a jet set was.  We've had four presidents who stayed here, lots of movie stars.	Royalty?
2 All the best people.

1 Jack is going to take care of the Overlook for this winter.  I would like you to take him around the place as soon as we are through.	Fine.
2 Jack is a schoolteacher.

1 Did he really get his head cut off, Dad? That's what Brady said.	If you don't stop it I'm going to vomit. I mean it.

1 Not bad, huh? My Uncle Al took off the regular muffler and put on a Cherry Bomb.	What's that?
2 Glasspack. He said he'd come over sometime this summer and we'd soup up the engine... but now I dunno. He's getting a divorce and he's in the doghouse with my mother.	For getting a divorce?
3 Well... it is his third.

1 Yeah, okay, the fireworks. Jane thinks that's all I'm mad about, but it's not. Them doing that is just a... a...	It's just an outward symbol of everything that's inwardly wrong in this town. Not bad, huh? I read Sherwood Anderson in college. I can jive that shit all day.
2 Well... I like it that you always know how to say things, Uncle Al.	I'll give you the telephone numbers of my ex-wives, dear boy- they'll be interested to hear that.
3 Don't call me dear boy.	But you are, you know- you are my dear boy.

1 Do you really think that a man who took a rocket in the eye three nights ago could be out mowing his lawn? He'd either be in the hospital... or dead.	I didn't shoot him when he was a man. I shot him when he was-
2 When he was a werewolf. Yes. Right. Jesus. Jane, you don't really believe this madness, do you?

1 I come here because Marty needs a friend.	Yes... you've always been that to him. But if you can't leave your booze in whatever dump you call home, you better just stay away.

1 LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED	What you say?
2 LET THY SOUL BE HEALED

1 How are you doing.	Hey, Sisters.  Are you going in there?
2 You know it.

1 Babe, it's not me!  I love you!  It's God!	You lying sleazeball!  The best years of my life!  What am I, garbage?  Am I lint?

1 The minute I saw you. I said to myself, she's a weaver.  Have you ever used a loom?	Not in years.
2 Well, it all comes back, in just a jiffy.  I'm working on a wall-hanging, of the convent.	Why?
3 To sell, of course.  I hate to say it, but we're in terrible trouble here at St. Katherine's.  We need a new roof, the furnace is going, and there's no money.	But don't you get money?  From the Vatican?

1 SPRING IS HERE THE SUN WILL SHINE I'LL BE HIS AND HE'LL BE MINE WE'LL LOVE UNTIL THE END OF TIME AND WE'LL NEVER BE LONELY ANYMORE	Because we're

1 Mary Clarence, are you with us?	Um, I don't really know this one...

1 We could cut a demo.  Look for a label.	That's true, wouldn't that be great.  Of course, we never know when things are going to change.  Any one of us could be transferred to another convent, tomorrow.

1 Well, then there's only one thing to do.	What?
2 Reverend Mother says you need experience, right, in life.  In order to make a responsible decision.  This is going to be very painful for me.  You know how much I love this little room. This whole convent.  Wait.

1 Mary Clarence!	Keep moving!

1 The Council of Cardinals!  I'm so nervous!  What if I forget the words?	Right to Hell.  Just kidding. Where is that bus?

1 Fine.  Got it.  Look, the way I see it, I'm stuck here, right?  I mean, I'm here or I'm target practice.  So here's the deal -- I don't bug you, you don't bug me.  I'll catch up on some sleep, watch some tube, lay back and lay low.  So just get me a key and show me to my room, and do not disturb.  Capisce?	Of course.  But it's almost lunch.

1 This shall be your cell, Mary Clarence.	My what?
2 Your cell.  Your room.

1 Mary Clarence, perhaps you are correct.	I am?
2 You may stay.  But I shall restrict your activities to but a single task.	What?
3 You have, I believe, some minimal background in music.  Therefore, you are to join our choir.

1 Reverend Mother -- Thank-you.	Oh?
2 You saved my life.	I'm a Christian.

1 Jesus, what do you think this is -- Wheel of Fortune?  Let me spell it out for you.  You have to hide like you don't even exist.  You have to get so far hidden away that you never see sunlight.	Okay -- no limo.
2 No nothing.	What're you gonna do, put me in a bag and bury me?
3 I'm gonna put you in the last place on Earth that Vince would ever look for you.

1 Well..  thanks.  I've been thinking about you.. - sometimes.  I mean, there aren't a lot of guys around here.  I mean, sometimes I feel like... a nun.	Me too.
2 You're not... seeing anybody?	No.  Most of the time I'm thinking about you.  And now... you've really changed.
3 I have?	You re sort of... radiant.   your eyes are shining.  You're rea1ly different...

1 We could put you into our witness protection program.	A hiding place.

1 It's done?	Not... totally.
2 What's the problem?

1 But, boss -- she's still, you know, a nun.	She's a broad!  Got it!  Just some broad!

1 We sound terrible   We need Mary Clarence.	We're losing it.

1 Is this like your old convent?	Which convent was that, Sister?

1 You mean -- they kidnapped her?	Yes -- two men -- and they had guns.

1 Las Vegas -- she's here somewhere.	But where?

1 We both missed.	Okay, so the problem is still the nun outfit, right?

1 What the hell are you doing?	You are the blacksmith.  Ever shod a horse with a hoof this large?
2 Never.  A shoe that size I would have remembered.

1 It has been a terrible jolt to her nerves.	You will stay at her side?

1 Taken.  Taken by the Headless Horseman.  Taken back to hell.	Pardon me?

1 Very few, if any.	Even though I have seen confessions pried from the lips of the accused, often quite literally?
2 For one who calls himself a Federalist, your mouth reeks of Republican liberalism.	Not Liberalism.  Equanimity.

1 We are farmers here, not lawyers or bankers, or even constables.  Every penny we earn comes from what we send down the Hudson.	I know it.

1 Thank you.	Now, hold the bowl steady.  Back to business.

1 Someone left last night.  Looked like they headed to the square, but I lost them in the forest.	Man or woman?
2 All I saw was their lantern.	Business, best hidden is hidden best at night.

1 She's the one who controlled the Horseman, isn't she, sir?  Sir? 	I need time for thinking.  Without you hanging on my coattails for a change.

1 Is it me, or are you this nervous around all women?	Perhaps it is because your suitor's hands were recently very nearly wrapped around my throat.
2 My suitor?	The massive fellow... Brom.  For someone you call "friend," he misplaces a good portion of jealousy.
3 He has proposed to me twice.	Which may explain his temperament. To have asked twice means the answer was "no" at least once.

1 Why would you do such a thing?	No stone may be left unturned.  It may appear harsh...
2 I have misjudged you I think.  I did not imagine you were so cruel.	You are not regarding it in full. The Widow Windsor had been run through by a sword.  I followed the bloodless wound, a wound whose path I could not comprehend till I had seen the Horseman with my own eyes.
3 What are you on about?	The child she carried was eight months grown at least... near to birthing.  The sword had pierced its tiny heart exactly.
4 Must I hear this?	There was no blind stabbing.  This singular thrust found its target omnipotently, as if the Horseman made certain the unborn child died with its mother.
5 And this gives worth to butchery?	It was not butchery.
6 What is it then?  Scientific method? How can any of this matter in the slightest?	I have no solution for its meaning yet, but I could not just ignore it.
7 Take a lesson from Young Masbath's desires, Ichabod Crane.  He follows with you to avenge his father's death. That I understand.  But, what do you want?	To avenge his father, and the others.
8 But, why?  Tell me why.

1 What... what are you doing... ?	I'm drawing bad blood from the wound.

1 You said yourself.  What mere man could have downed the Belltower?	It is a prime tenet of science, Philipse, that because one thing appears improbable does not mean you embrace the utterly fantastical.

1 Van Ripper... do you have a gun?	Yes.  Here...

1 Go home.	May I see my mother?
2 You do not want to be here.  Go home to your father.	She did not do it... please listen...
3 She is guilty.	No, sir, please... she is innocent...
4 She has confessed.	No.
5 She has admitted to her evil and signed a written confession.  Do you know what confession is?  All that is left for you now is to pray for her soul.

1 Thank ye.	Scooter, let's me and you go over to Dairy Queen and pick up a few things for lunchtime.

1 My name is Frank Wheatley. What's your name?	Karl's my name.

1 He don't want to Doyle. Don't go Vaughan if you don't want to. You'll wreck Doyle, you're drunk.	But honey, I'll be good. I promise. I love you sweetie. I'm just tryin' to help these two be part of things.

1 I want to watch T.V.	Yeah, honey, let the kid watch T.V. Hell, let's all watch T.V. like a family till your retarded friend and your homosexual friend gets here.

1 You like that Vaughan?	Sure. It sounded like a number one tune all right.
2 You enjoying yourself, Karl?

1 I ain't never used no hatchet that I remember.	You're just crazy in a retarded kind of way then.  It wouldn't matter to me if you did do violence on somebody 'cause I ain't afraid of shit. You think I'm afraid for you to stay here. You're just a humped over retard it looks like to me. Not really, I'm just jokin' with you. Welcome to our humble home, buddy. Frank needs all the friends he can get. Frank's a real weak little kid. His daddy taught him how to be a pussy.

1 Hey there. I thought I heard somebody on the porch. Wasn't your name Karl?	Yeah it is. Your name's Frank.
2 Yeah. What you doin' by here?	You told me to come by.
3 Did you want to play ball with us?	I ain't no good at it. I just come by.
4 Well, anyhow, I was just fixin' to go see my mama down at Ben's Dollar Store. She's workin' two till eight.	All right then.

1 Way to go, Karl. We got a touchdown. That was a good lateral, man. That was just like the Wishbone.	I dern near had me a touchdown till them boys got a-hold of me there so I figured I better give it off to you. I seen you over there follerin' me.
2 We're liable to win if we keep this up. For somebody like you, you sure run fast.

1 How come Karl won't eat here with us?	I don't know. He just said he'd eat out there.

1 A blister shore can hurt.	Yeah.
2 Flowers is pretty. I've always thought that.	Me, too.

1 You scared me.	I didn't aim to.
2 Want to sit down? Did you need somethin'?	No ma'am.

1 Yes sir.	So, you're really going to stay here?
2 That boy wants me to.	Did you knock on the door yet?
3 Naw, I ain't.	How long have you been standing here?
4 Quite a spell, I reckon.	Listen, before you get very used to staying here, I think you and I need to talk about a few things. Can I take you to lunch?
5 I done et just a little bit ago.	I mean tomorrow or the next day.
6 I reckon I can stand to eat a little somethin' or 'nother at noontime tomorrow. Bill Cox generally gets me a box of french fried potaters. But I reckon he can lay off doin' it tomorrow.	Okay, I'll come by Mr. Cox's and get you at noon.

1 Karl, maybe you and Melinda might want to take a walk or something after dinner. It's a nice night.	Vaughan, don't get pushy.
2 I'm sorry.

1 Also, Melinda, please don't tell anybody at the store that Albert was here tonight, okay.	Why?
2 Well, a lot of people in town talk and spread cruel rumors. Unfortunately, I have to keep certain parts of my life private.	You mean about y'all bein' together in "that" way?
3 Yes.	I think everybody at the store knows that already. They always talk about it. Maureen Ledbetter told a awful story about why you ain't allowed over at the First Baptist Church no more.

1 What'll it be, Auggie?	Uh...  My friend over here would like a corned beef on rye and a ginger ale.

1 Hey, Auggie, I've just been thinking. You wouldn't need some help around the store, would you? Some summer help while Vinnie's gone?	Help? Hmm. It's possible. What did you have in mind?
2 I'm thinking about the kid. I'm sure he'd do a good job for you.	Hey, kid. You interested in a job? I just got word from your employment agency that you're looking for a position in retail sales.

1 Fine.  Or it was until a couple of days ago. A guy from The New York Times called and asked me to write a Christmas story. They want to publish it on Christmas Day.	That's a feather in your cap, man. The paper of record.
2 Yeah, great. The problem is, I have four days to come up with something, and I don't have a single idea.  You know anything about Christmas stories?	Christmas stories? Sure, I know a ton of 'em.
3 Anything good?	Good? Of course. Are you kidding?  I'll tell you what. Buy me lunch, my friend, and I'll tell you the best Christmas story you ever heard. How's that? And I guarantee every word of it is true.
4 It doesn't have to be true. It just has to be good.	Take over the register while I'm gone, okay, Jimmy? 

1 So you're just going to give up and go home?	I don't have much choice, do I? It's pretty clear she doesn't want me around.
2 Still, you can't just write her off.	Yeah? And what else am I supposed to do? There's no baby anymore, and if she wants to throw away her life, that's her business.
3 She's just a kid. There's time for more babies later. After she grows up.	Dream on, Auggie. She'll be lucky to make it to her nineteenth birthday.
4 Not if you got her into one of those rehab programs.	I'd never be able to talk her into it. And even if I could, those things cost money. And that's just what I don't have. I'm flat out dead broke.
5 No you're not.	Are you calling me a liar? I'm telling you I'm broke. I don't even have insurance on my goddamned car.
6 Remember that business venture I was telling you about? Well, my tugboat came in. I'm flush.	Bully for you.
7 No, bully for you.

1 Come on, come on, you yellow belly. The whole thing. First name and last name.	What difference does it make?

1 I don't mean to be nosy, but I was wondering what happened to your arm.	An ugly piece of hardware, isn't it?  I'll tell you what happened to my arm.  I'll tell you what happened.  Twelve years ago, God looked down on me and said, "Cyrus, you're a bad, stupid, selfish man. First of all, I'm going to fill your body with spirits, and then I'm going to put you behind the wheel of a car, and then I'm going to make you crash that car and kill the woman who loves you. But you, Cyrus, I'm going to let you live, because living is a lot worse than death. And just so you don't forget what you did to that poor girl, I'm going to rip off your arm and replace it with a hook. If I wanted to, I could rip off both your arms and both your legs, but I'm going to be merciful and just take off your left arm. Every time you look at your hook, I want you to remember what a bad, stupid, selfish man you are. Let that be a lesson to you, Cyrus, a warning to mend your ways."
2 And have you mended them?	I don't know. I try. Every day I keep on trying, but it's no easy task for a man to change his nature.  I'm off the booze, though. Haven't had a drop in six years. And now I've got me a wife. Doreen. Best damned woman I've ever known.  And a little boy, too. Cyrus Junior.  So things have definitely improved since I got fitted with this hook. If I can just turn this goddamn garage around, I'll be in pretty good shape.
3 You named the kid after yourself, huh?	That boy's one in a million. A real tiger.

1 I'll tell you why they're not going anywhere.	Yeah? And why is that?
2 Management. Those guys are walking around with their heads up their asses.

1 That's it. Just the two rooms.	This is the first house I've been in without a TV.
2 I used to have one, but it broke a couple of years ago and I never got around to replacing it.  I'd just as soon not have one anyway. I hate those damn things.	But then you don't get to watch the ball games. You told me you were a Mets fan.
3 I listen on the radio. I can see the games just fine that way.  The world is in your head, remember?	Nice drawing. Did you do that?
4 My father did. Believe it or not, that little baby is me.	Yeah, I can believe it.
5 It's strange, though, isn't it? Looking at yourself before you knew who you were.	Is your father an artist?
6 No, he was a schoolteacher. But he liked to dabble.	He's dead?
7 Twelve, thirteen years ago.  Actually, he died with his sketch pad open on his lap. Up in the Berkshires one weekend, drawing a picture of Mount Greylock.	Drawing's a good thing.
8 Is that what you do? Draw pictures?	Yeah, sometimes.  I like to dabble, too.

1 Yes, an invitation. I apologize for springing it on you at the last minute, but Mr. Benjamin and I are attending a celebration tonight, and we would be most pleased if you chose to accompany us.  Isn't that right, Mr. Benjamin?	Absolutely. We would be honored.

1 If it doesn't make any difference, why not just say it?	I was going to tell him ... but in my own time. In my own time... .

1 So the blood on the gaff was not fish blood at all.  It was <u>human</u>, yes?  Type B positive.	Carl Heine's type.

1 Just three questions.  The Miyamoto family bought your seven acres for $4500?	Tried to.  Defaulted on their payments.
2 Second question.  What did Ole Jurgensen pay you per acre?	A thousand.
3 So that makes what would have been $4500 into $7000, doesn't it?  If you sent the equity back, you had a profit of $2500.	Is that your third question?
4 It is.	You done your math right.

1 You thought the deceased might... break his promise?	Of course not.  We're just not quick to run and boast.  In case something went wrong.
2 And then, something did.  Carl Heine was found dead.  With his head crushed.

1 My mom.  Would be the problem.	Why?  We're only talking.

1 You don't believe in God anymore.	Agnostics don't believe or disbelieve, Ma.  We just don't pretend we know.

1 ...comes off third cleat from the stern, port side.  And it's brand new.  Unlike the rest.	And the next one...?
2 From Carl Heine's boat.  All his were like this one, three-strand manila, new condition, braided in loops.  Not bowlined like Miyamoto's.	And the last...?
3 Found on Carl's boat, too.  Starboard side, second cleat from the stern. But it doesn't match Carl's lines. It matches Miyamoto's.  perfect.

1 <u>Everything</u> had to happen <u>just</u> right.  For your little story to fly.  I mean, a blond hair could be on that gunnel for a <u>lot</u> of reasons.	I'm sorry, was there a question in there?

1 But Carl was a fisherman.  And successful at it.	He said he didn't want that life no more.  He'd been saving to buy a farm.  He was sorry I got sick. But pretty excited to get back his father's place.

1 How long you have this detail?	Me and Smoltz came on dogwatch September 16.

1 This tastes horrible, hmmn?	You're wondering why I held it.
2 I'm wondering how the judge is gonna like my waking up his old bones.  in the middle of the night.

1 Cigarette?	I'll take two.  One for later.

1 You must think I like losing.	I think you like learning.

1 I think you testified <u>all</u> the lights were on.  Cabin, mast, net lights, picking lights...	Yessir, there'd been real heavy fog.
2 And yet you started the engine right up.  With all those lights drawing all night, the batteries had that much charge.  Did that strike you odd?	Didn't think about it at the time. So no, it didn't strike me odd.
3 Does it now?	A little.  Yes.  You have to wonder.
4 You have to wonder.

1 In your motorcycle example.  Those injuries are produced by the head being propelled <u>against</u> an object. Rather than the reverse, yes?	Obviously.
2 Can you tell whether an object moved against the head, or the other way around?  Or would both look the same.	The same.
3 So if his head struck something narrow and flat, the gunnel of a boat, a net roller, a fairlead, could that have...	If the head was moving fast enough, but I don't see how it could be.
4 Is it possible?	Sure, anything's poss...
5 Is it fair to say that you do not know for <u>certain</u> which it was.	I already said that, b...
6 <u>And</u> that you can't say for <u>certain</u> whether the head injury was sustained before or <u>after</u> death?

1 ...He used to say, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it."	I...see.  I'm not sure I quite get your...point...
2 Well, the soldiers we've got now, they've been through all kinds of heavy shit...and they've always got the job done.  Now these new ones, these "hot shots" of yours...what kind of action have they seen?  They <u>are</u> battle-tested, aren't they?	That's up to you field guys.  H.Q. wants you to break 'em in when you do the annual security sweep in January.
3 The sweep is just routine, not even police action.  I'd like to see some sort of...meaningful evidence...	Such as?
4 Maybe we could run some tests.  Kind of a comparison, the old and the new...

1 You're in Berths 7 and 7A.	Thank you ever so.
2 You're welcome.	It's entirely mutual.

1 Same faces - same instruments -  - and here's your Valentine's card.	Those two musicians from the garage!
2 They wouldn't be caught dead in Chicago - so we'll finish the job here.  Come on.

1 No.  And he ain't been eating so good, either. He's got an empty stomach and it's gone to his head.	But, Joe - three weeks in Florida!  We could borrow some clothes from the girls in the chorus -
2 You've flipped your wig!	Now you're talking!  We pick up a couple of second-hand wigs - a little padding here and there - call ourselves Josephine and Geraldine -
3 Josephine and Geraldine!  Come on!

1 It's no use.  We'll never get away with it, Joe.	The name is Josephine.  And it was your idea in the first place.

1 Forget it.  One false move, and they'll toss us off the train - there'll be the police, and the papers, and the mob in Chicago...	Boy, would I like to borrow a cup of that Sugar.
2 Look - no butter, no pastry, and no Sugar!	You tore it again!

1 I heard a very sad story about a girl who went to Bryn Mawr.  She squealed on her roommate, and they found her strangled with her own brassiere.	Yes - you have to be very careful about picking a roommate.

1 That's some nerve!	Daphne got a proposal tonight.

1 You crazy or something?  The place is crawling with mobsters - gangrene is setting in - and you're making like Diamond Jim Brady!  How are we going to get out of here?  How are we going to eat?	We'll walk.  And if we have to, we'll starve.
2 There you go with that we again.

1 Good night, Sugar.	Good night, honey.
2 Honey - she called me honey.

1 I'll carry the instruments.	Thank you, Daphne.

1 Well, I'll be - !   How about that guy?	Now look, Daphne - hands off - I saw him first.
2 Sugar, dear - let me give you some advice. If I were a girl - and I am - I'd watch my step.	If I'd been watching my step, I never would have met him.  Wait till I tell Josephine.
3 Yeah - Josephine.	Will she be surprised. I just can't wait to see her face -
4 Neither can I.  Come on - lets go up to her room and tell her - right now.

1 Where did you girls play before?	Oh - here and there - and around.

1 If there is one thing I admire, it's a girl with a shapely ankle.	Me too.  Bye now.
2 Let me carry one of the instruments.	Thank you.  Aren't you a sweetheart?

1 I called Mama - she was so happy she cried - she wants you to have her wedding gown - it's white lace.	Osgood - I can't get married in your mother's dress.  She and I - we' not built the same way.
2 We can have it altered.	Oh, no you don't!  Look, Osgood - I'm going to level with you. We can't get married at all.
3 Why not?	Well, to begin with, I'm not a natural blonde.
4 It doesn't matter.	And I smoke. I smoke all the time.
5 I don't care.	And I have a terrible past.  For three years now, I've been living with a saxophone player.
6 I forgive you.	And I can never have children.
7 We'll adopt some.	But you don't understand!  I'm a MAN!
8 Well - nobody's perfect.

1 Please, Jerry - that's no way to talk.  Nellie baby - what are you doing tonight?	Why?
2 Because I got some plans -	I'm not doing anything.  I just thought I'd go home and have some cold pizza -
3 And you'll be in all evening?	Yes, Joe.
4 Good!  Then you won't be needing your car.	My car?  Why, you -

1 Tell what?	If they catch me once more, they'll boot me out of the band.  You the replacement for the bass and the sax?

1 Thanks, honey.	Good night, Sugar.

1 Well, I guess I'd better go -	It's been delightful meeting you both.
2 And you will come to hear us tonight?	If it's at all possible -

1 I seem to be out of gas.	It's sort of funny - you being out of gas - I mean, Shell Oil and everything -

1 Maybe if you saw a good doctor...	I have.  Spent six months in Vienna with Professor Freud - flat on my back -  - then there were the Mayo Brothers - and injections and hypnosis and mineral baths - if I weren't such a coward, I'd kill myself.
2 Don't talk like that.  I'm sure there must be some girl some place that could -	If I ever found a girl that could - I'd marry her like that.

1 Gee, I wish I'd been there.	I'm going to see him again tonight - and every night - I think he's going to propose to me - as soon as he gets up his nerve.

1 Good evening, sir.	I come to the old lady's funeral.
2 I don't believe I've seen you at any of our services before.	That's because I've been on the wagon.
3 PLEASE!	Where are they holding the wake? I'm supposed to be one of the pallbearers.
4 Show the gentleman to the chapel - pew number three.

1 Hello, Charlie.  Long time no see.	What is it, Spats?  What do you want here?
2 Just dropped in to pay my respects.	You don't owe me no nothing.
3 Oh, I wouldn't say that.  You were nice enough to recommend my mortuary to some of your friends...

1 God, Kat! Please. Dont be nice to me. I can take anything right now but you being nice to me.	What? Why? What do you mean?

1 Youd better get going. My parents will be round to cart you off to the country.	Whatever you do, dont mention Italy. Or politics. Or baby buggies.  Or Edith Piaf.
2 Your probably best off pretending youre asleep.

1 Whats going on with you two?	I was pretty hard on her last night.  And now shes getting married.
2 Theres a reason I always tell that Tony Pee-Pants story, you know.	Trust me. This is bigger than Tony Pee-Pants.
3 Before Tony, you and your sister were best friends. I couldnt split you up. If your sister ate the spinach, you ate the spinach. If you threw up--.	Mom, please.
4 Anyway, when that boy came over, it was the first time you ever did anything without her.  And Amy wasnt just jealous...she was sad and lonely. She missed you.	She did?
5 So she flirted with Tony, and you got mad and sent him away. Who did that leave?  You and Amy. Reunited.

1 I didnt deserve her back then.	And you do now?

1 Whoa, Jeffrey. Slow down. You and me, were the past. Im not sure if you noticed, but Im here with someone else.	Kat, we must talk. This guy, theres something not quite right.
2 Its called character. God, youre predictable.	Is that why you brought him? Because of me.

1 You think we look like were trying too hard.	Exactly. I want us to look like we fit, but not like were trying too hard to look like we fit.  Its welcome cocktails, not prom. With this level of matchy-matchy, we should be drinking peach schnapps under a bleacher somewhere.

1 No, count it, anyway.	Why?
2 Im compulsive and weird?

1 Would you grab my shampoo?	Shampoo, got it!

1 Subtle?	I disappear. Its not about me.

1 You have had girlfriends?	Sure, but its never easy. They say theyre okay with it, and they are...for a while. Then one day, theyre not.

1 Hi.	Hi.

1 You want I nut him in the boat?	Yes? No. What?  Save the patter for the tourists.
2 You want me to let him in?	Of course, dont be silly.

1 Im guessing MacCallum, 18 years.  Neat, with a water-back.	Is there any other way to take it?

1 And you say all them people is dead now?	That's right--

1 What are you looking at, out there? There's nothing to see.	My daddy likes to look into the dark, even when there ain't nothin to see -- it's what you hear he say.

1 If anybody's to blame, it's me -- I oughta nailed him when I took that shot.	It was too dark, Daddy.
2 Yeah. We better git back to house now.

1 Can you say what camp they gon' send you to, Daddy?	I don't know, son -- they won't tell us things like that -- but I don't want y'all to come here no more.
2 Why, Daddy; you won't be here?	Just do like I tell you -- I'll get word to you through the visitin' preacher.

1 I'm real proud of how you helped your mama to keep this place goin', David Lee.	Thank you, Daddy...

1 David, you never cease to amaze me at how good you are in taking care of my garden.	My father taught me...

1 You got two shirts on?	Yes mam...
2 When you get outta that school, you come right on back home, y'all gon' have to take this laundry work I done for Miss Boatwright today.

1 Mama! Mama! Miss Boatwright, say she gon' help me find where Daddy is!	Good! But you don't have to tell the whole valley 'bout it! You'll get that woman in trouble!

1 Be good and be smart, little boy.	Yes, ma'm...

1 You know, one time by mistake I went into a white church down in Row County and to this day I don't know how'n the devil I got outta that church alive.	They probly thought you was crazy.
2 I guess so -- but I went home and did me some praying to the Lord. I said, Lord, I went into this white church down in Row and all I want you to tell me is how I ever got outta there in one piece.	What did the Lord tell you, Ike?
3 He said, I don't know, Ike -- you doin' better'n me, I been tryin' to git in there for 200 years and ain't make it yet!

1 I bet you could use a hot cup of coffee, Nathan Lee.	I shore could, Miss Rebecca.

1 There, you see?	I see, all right -- It's time for us to get out of this field.
2 I just got out here!	It's lunchtime, and I wanna have a talk with you, Nathan Lee. Come on, children...

1 Well, anyway... Today children, our friend Mr. Hat is going to tell us all about the environment.	That's right, Mr. Garrison. The environment is what surrounds us. It is what we live and breathe.
2 I hate the environment.

1 <b>And my mom has become so bu-sy that she's raising heck and ignoring me I agree that there is now a battle to be won! Something must be done!</b>	But what are we going to do against this entire army?

1 How come Terrance and Phillip are so weird looking?	Cuz, dummy they're Canadian, just like Ike!
2 Oh.

1 WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?!	Dude, they cut out 92 minutes!

1 Mph rmpmh rm.	No way.

1 Ugh... You guys, seriously... I'm having Cheesy Poof withdrawal...	Mkay, kids from all over the State have been brought here, because you all share the same problem. Uh, young man... Let's start with you.

1 We can't, we're on a hunger strike.	A hunger strike? For what?

1 May I?	What?

1 Mph rmph rm!	Get everyone in hell ready. When the blood of Terrance and Phillip spills, the day is ours!

1 No... The General is right.	MOM!!!
2 Boobie... This is the only way you're ever going to learn. I have an opportunity here to teach you about consequences.

1 Be careful, dude.	Careful? Was my mother careful when she stabbed me in the heart with a clothes hanger while I was still in ze womb?

1 Dude, anybody who doesn't think Terrance and Phillip is funny can fuck off anyways.	Yeah...

1 This is sweet!!	Totally!

1 Stan!	Dude, I found the clitoris! I think I can get Wendy to like me now!
2 Sweet.

1 Shiteater-	-Or monkey fucker-

1 Article 42!  You don't mean-?!	Yes Principal Victoria.  The PTA is impeaching you.
2 But I-	You are officially relieved of your duties as principal of this school!

1 HA HA HA! You burned yourself to death by lighting the fart! HA HA HA!!	I sure did, Phillip!!

1 Did you hear that, Terrance? I farted!	You did? Just now?

1 Yeah!  YEAH!!!  Man I'm getting so HOT!!!	Do you always think about sex?  I'm talking about some very important stuff here!
2 Listen buttercup, let's make love and forget about the whole thing.	Is sex the only thing that matters to you?

1 Ow, you're hurting me!	Listen guy, you're embarassing me in front of my friends!  You know how I get mad when I get embarassed.

1 Stan! Stan are you okay?!	Wendy?

1 I never though I'd be stuck in a wine closet with Warren Wayne.	Well get used to it, 'cause here we are, on the cruise of a lifetime.

1 And what are they doing now, Mac?	They are awaiting further information.

1 It's telling me fail mode confirmed.  Did you see this?	There must be some mistake. You sure you hit the right commands?
2 Yes I'm sure I hit the right commands.	Why don't you reset and run it again.  The pods check out ok.

1 Barnes, can you hear me, are you all right?	Why yes Ryan, I am, and thanks for asking.  You don't have to talk to the intercom, I can hear you fine.
2 What is the condition of the bridge?

1 Barnes?	That's me.
2 Break it down to me, what's going on?	Seems like they're cooperating. Hopefully I'll be out of here and on my way very soon.
3 Well don't drag your ass.  There won't be much of a window for us to link up.  We'll be in your orbit trajectory in less than two hours.	Yeah, I know Bill, I came up with the plan remember?  Just have those hangar doors open and ready, I can take it from there.
4 Will do.  What about the distress signal?	I don't know.  I really haven't made up my mind yet.  We'll see how nicely they behave.

1 Well, more power to you.  Me, I start to bug out after too much time out here.	I don't have a problem with it. Besides, you get to meet a lot of interesting people.

1 I don't think you know what you're talking about.  Besides, what could we use for tools?  A steak knife?  A corkscrew?	Just considering our options... sir.

1 I can't let you do that.	Look I know what I'm doing. I have experience and training in space walking.
2 Simulated space walking.

1 Dawn!  Dawn!	Helllp!

1 I'm in the bridge.	Barnes?

1 What is it?!	I don't know.  Wave to them!

1 It's getting too cold in here.  I can't stand this anymore!	Baby, take it easy.
2 How can you sit there with your fat stomach and tell me to take it easy!  I want to go home!  I want to be warm!  I want to get out of here!

1 Now Mac, can you tell me the status of this deck?	One moment please...  one moment please...

1 You a mini-golfer?	Nope.
2 Paradise, huh? Might be one of the new putt-putts off route 99. Theo turns to leave.	Can I get you something for the road?
3 You have orange whips?	Orange who? Not from 'round here, are ya?
4 No. I'm from Akron.

1 Ah, come on, lemme see your ball.	You afraid we're gonna steal it?

1 Bowling police, step back, give him room.	Nothing going on here, everybody stand back. Let him through, ladies. Ladies, please. As they start to move through the female throng, a little girl pops out in front of them, holding her ball.

1 Buzz Fazeli.	Theo.
2 I know your face, you're an up-and-comer. You bowl on the tour.	I'm not on the tour this year.
3 Need some advice, huh.	Well, Mr. Fazeli, the Bowling Congress says I'm a thorn in their side.
4 Don't worry about the Congress, they're just a bunch of moralistic busy-bodies.

1 Watch out for that one. She's got a great average, but she's looking for a prince. And, believe me, she's 	kissed a lotta tadpoles.  Listen, I been thinking about your problem. I'm not the guy to sponsor you. It would be unethical. But, there is something I could do for you.  Putt-putt golf.
2 Putt-putt golf?

1 So, eh, you never saw me. Right?	I never saw you.
2 Thanks, kid.  Where are you goin' now?	I'm goin' straight. No more short cuts. Theo gets into the car. Buzz leans in the open window.
3 Listen, if straight doesn't work out, you come work for me.  Just make sure nobody's following you. Buzz's face is eerily lit by the glow of the sunset, his halo bouncing in the breeze.	I didn't mean that stuff I said. I was trying to keep you out of this muddle. I'm glad I didn't have my tubes tied. Oh, and by the way, I made a call for you before I - uh - retired. Buzz takes his card and scrawl on the back with a gold pen.
4 You give Ed Klein of the American Bowling Congress a call.  Tell him your Maynard's boy. He's expecting you, and he owes me. He'll getcha back in like Flynn.  Don't say I never gave you nothing.	See ya 'round Maynard.

1 JUNIOR!  You're supposed to say JUNIOR WHO! I'm going to have to hurt you. Theo and Junior circle one another.	You shouldn't touch her.
2 No, Junior, you shouldn't touch her.	Nobody touches her. Except me. I touch her. Sheila told me you played bouncy- bouncy with her.
3 What did your dad tell you to do to Buzz? Theo scrambles up the lane on hands and knees. Junior catches him, grabbing his ankles.	He told me to play Blue-Face with Buzz. I like games.
4 What did you do to Buzz?	You played bouncy-bouncy with Sheila, so I'm gonna play Blue-Face with you. 
5 I don't want to play.

1 So you're Buzz's boy. I've been expecting you. You hurt my feelings when you didn't come and see me sooner.	You know who I am?
2 Nobody sticks a finger into a bowling ball in this town without Miles Kastle knowing about it. You don't mind if I have a word with Theo, do you bunny? Kastle takes Theo by the elbow and pulls him away.	I heard you've been having a little trouble with the Congress.  Theo pulls his eyes off Sheila. Kastle walks Theo past pairs of bowlers.
3 You might say I'm at the top of their shit list.	Maybe I can help you.  Try a lighter ball, Penelope - you'll get hurt with that big ball, honey.  I've seen tapes of you bowling on the circuit. You got Fazeli blood running through you. Your pop was a genuine talent in his day.
4 What's with the bad air between you two, Mr. Kastle?	It's nothing, just a slight business imbalance.  How's Gloria's thumb?

1 Fantastic! What talent.	You still got the touch Junior.

1 What's your specialty?	Whips...orange whips.
2 Then I'll have the number four with one of your finest whips.	How do you want it?  The eggs.
3 Uh...over easy.	Coming right up.

1 I don't think your new outfit suits you, Theo.	Really? I kinda like it.

1 Where are you going?	I think your brother may have already gotten to Buzz. He gets into his car.
2 Can I come with you?	I did your dirty work for you Sheila, now fuck off. Theo drives away leaving Sheila standing alone. She watches his car recede with a thoughtful expression, then turns on her heel.

1 Very good, busyboy.	Dwarf bowling's illegal.
2 What are you gonna do, call the bowling police?

1 In basic English, what does all this mean?	Basic English?  There's no way this spacecraft was constructed on our planet.

1 Nobody move.	But she's --
2 Nobody move!

1 Don't do it!	Now!

1 What is it?  A military spacecraft? Like a shuttle or satellite?	Something like that.  That doesn't surprise you?
2 Not really, no.  Something of the military crashes in the ocean -- it explains why there was nothing on the news, why you've kept everything a secret...  When did it crash?	As best we can estimate, it crashed four hundred years ago.

1 Harry's missing.	What do you mean, he's missing?
2 He's missing.  He's gone.  He left.	He's here somewhere.  Find him.  The sub's on it's way.  Go!  C'mon!

1 What the hell?  It shut us down.	Jerry?  Please.  Stop this.
2 Ted, go into the control room. Listen for my instructions.

1 Nothing, sir.	What the hell is going on here?

1 Man is man, all he knows is man, and all he can think of is what he knows.  The anthropomorphic problem. Good, Norman.	The what?

1 With an "o".  Harold with an "o".	What -- you want me to retype it?

1 We had considered it.	Considered what?  That it's American? How would you think it's American?

1 It's not talking, it's mimicking.	Give him a chance.  He's speaking our language, not the other way around.

1 Norman!	Get this thing off me.

1 You said something to him, didn't you?	What?
2 You told him about me?

1 ... what do you mean?  I'm in the ship.	What are you doing in the ship?  Beth?
2 Getting food.  We were out of food. what's wrong?  You sound mad.	Yeah, well, I get that way when I'm facing death and someone deserts me.
3 Deserts you?  Harry said he'd take over for me.	He what?

1 Diphenyl parlene.	Something for burns.
2 Ephedrine hydrochloride.

1 What's wrong, Norman?	I'm feeling better.
2 Are you?

1 Where is it coming from, Beth?	Don't you know?

1 I don't get it.	It doesn't make any sense.

1 Jerry.  Right.  I said Jerry, didn't I?	That's a hell of a mistake to make, Beth.
2 I'm sorry.  Slip of the tongue.	Yeah, I don't know how you could make that confusion.

1 Nice work, Norman.	Whatever I can do to help.

1 What is that?  That noise?	What noise?
2 It's like...

1 What is it?	You know what it is, Harry.

1 Three fifty-six, three fifty-five, three --	Shut up and catch.

1 It's just like swimming, Norman... You know how to swim, don't you?	You're not afraid of the water, are you, Norman?

1 Hey, go easy on the salt, will ya? We're not a bunch of icy streets here.	Salt's good for you, Ted.  Helps you from getting impotent.
2 Impotent?  I'm not impotent.

1 Any other bags, Dr. Johnson?	Just that.  Careful, it's heavy.

1 It's not some fucking substitution code, it's a direct visual representation.	You mean a picture?
2 Take a look.  I rearranged the numbers.  Put 'em up to the light.  Go ahead.  Squint at it.	I don't see anything.
3 Squint harder.	Please, Ted.
4 Try this one.	This is like nursery school.
5 Don't you see it?  It's a picture of the creature.	The creature?
6 Inside the sphere.  Look, that's the vertical torso, three legs, two arms.  There's no head, so I'm guessing the creature's head is located within the torso itself, you know?

1 I'm Han Solo, Captain of this vessel.  Who's in charge then?	I'm Ben Kenobi.  Luke Starkiller here is leading our expedition.

1 I'll get the information.	... and I want you to start cleaning the equipment out of the scan- shielded compartments.
2 What do you want with our scan-proof lockers?

1 I know who you are.  Stand up so that we can talk properly.  You're embarrassing me.  I'm not that important.	But you are... I know your 'Diary of the Clone Wars' by heart.  My father...

1 Are you all right?	Yes... the Force... something horrible has happened.  I couldn't see what it was, or where it was, but it was terrible... terrible beyond description... the cry of millions dying at once.

1 I'll tell you, Luke, and this is between you and me.  The star force isn't all it's cracked up to be. Frankly, it's a bore, and it's going to stay that way as long as this system is neutral...	But you always said things were so great at the academy... What happened?
2 The academy is fantastic... Of course, they won't teach you anything about flying you don't already know.  Most of the instructors are very conservative pilots.  You can fly circles around them... but there is a lot on the scientific side that is down-right amazing, and you get a lot of discipline... but after you graduate, don't join the star force -- go free-lance.  It's the only way to get into the action... I can't wait until my hitch is up.	At least you're doing something... I'd give anything to be in your position.
3 Just be warned, that things aren't always as they seem... especially the starforce recruiting posters.

1 There are only three or four left.	Chewbacca, it's time we showed them this isn't the regulation F8-88 Cargo Trawler.

1 You can't!  We've come this far.  We must find them...	Why?

1 It's only light that doesn't affect it.  Solid things, like rocks, can hurt it!  Fire above him!	Move out of the way!

1 I am Luke Starkiller at your service.	There'll be time for that later. Now let's get out of here.

1 Let him have it.  You're winning anyway.  It doesn't make any difference.	I know, sir, but it's the principle of the thing.

1 Funny how they always want to be your friends after they kick your guts out.	It's what I deserve.
2 Whad'ya talkin  about ?	I joined up for her. I wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for her. I'm a fool.
3 You made squad leader on your own, and, hey, you still got me to kick around.

1 Mr. Barcalow, save power, don't waste it on workers... Ace, tell Aardvark we're on our way...	Yes, sir !

1 How do you make him do that ?	I gave him the impression that there was a fly crawling up my mom's leg. He is going to go eat it.

1 I'm all ears.	Don't you have to finish the game ?

1 I want to be part of the best flight team in the Fleet...	Me, too... Day and Night-Cycle.

1 Where are you going ?	A funeral.
2 That girl who died on the way up ...his girl ?	Yeah.
3 How do you feel about him now ?	I don't know, Zander.
4 I do.

1 Isn't it great to be in love ?	How do I know if this is love ?
2 It wouldn't be so romantic if we weren't...

1 He was in the group with me. I guess he didn't...	Shhh ! Don't make him feel worse.

1 Shhhh...!	I'm glad you're doing so well. If they haven't made you squad leader by now, I'm sure you will.

1 AAAAAAAAAAAAAA !	We've gotta go get her !

1 Report.	Captain, we are in the path of an unidentified object moving at near light speed...

1 Cover me.	You got it.

1 Johnny, people get hurt... people get killed in the Federal Service. If something happened to you I don't know what I would do...	Who gave you this idea ? It's that teacher. What's his name ? You know the one I mean.

1 Wait a minute ! Carl is doing his Federal and he isn't inferior. He's the smartest kid at school !	Sorry. Carl's a fine boy...

1 I always wanted to go to Zegema Beach.	Good luck. It's not there anymore.

1 Well, yeah, sure...	I hope so. I hope you don't ruin your life over some silly little girl who wants to look handsome in a uniform.

1 We're outa here. Lieutenant, get your men into the skimmers. This real estate's about to go buggy.	Hey, just calm down, I'm giving the orders here-

1 Where'd you learn to do that, soldier ?	Uni High Tigers, sir. Don't you remember ? I was captain of the team.
2 I'm not interested in nostalgia, Rico, I need a corporal. You're it until you're dead or I find someone better.

1 Rico, tell'em to glass this goddam planet. I've never seen so many bugs upstairs at the same time...	We're not leaving you here, sir !

1 Kirk-unit, <U>why</U> do you not disclose information?	Because V'ger is going to destroy all the carbon units on the third planet.
2 They have repressed the Creator.	The information will not be disclosed.

1 As I stated, V'ger calls to the Creator.	V'ger is announcing that it has arrived, sir -- that it's ready to deliver the information it was programmed to collect...
2 'To learn all that is learnable.'	It expects a return signal now, ordering it to transmit that information to the Creator.

1 That's why you're staying aboard. I'm sorry, Will.	No, Admiral. I don't think you are; not one damned bit. I remember when you recommended me for this command. You told me how envious you were, and if only you could find a way to get a starship command again. Well, sir, it looks like you found a way.

1 I advise caution, Captain; we can't withstand another attack.	That thing is twenty hours from Earth. We know nothing about it yet.

1 They may have attacked only as a warning to us, Captain. To keep away.	That would presuppose a feeling, Commander... compassion. I sensed <U>no</U> emotion, only...  ... pure logic.

1 I now the Captain meant no person- al insult.	I would never take advantage of a sexually immature species.  You can assure him that's true, can't you?

1 Transmit, Mr. Spock! Now!	Ten seconds....

1 Maneuvering thrusters, Mr. Sulu; ahead one third.  Full sensor scan, Mr. Spock; they can't expect us <U>not</U> to look them over now!	Thrusters ahead, one third.

1 Also -- there was nothing in your report about <U>why</U> you're here.	That inquiry invades my personal life, Captain.

1 No vessel could generate a powerfield of this magnitude...	Instruments fluctuating, Captain. Patterns unrecognizable.

1 If this is their ship's data banks, where is the crew? Or is their entire ship automated?	Captain, I do not believe there <U>is</U> a crew -- or that this is a vessel as such.

1 There's no way to know. V'ger expected it to be a machine -- some single entity.  All of us here may be reduced into patterns...	That seems to be what it has planned -- to have the Creator physically present here.

1 So young, so unlined, so full of promise.  So innocent.	I beg your pardon?

1 The, the, the, the <u>sanctity</u> of everyday things...	Everyday things...yes.
2 For example, he's just come back from a <u>fire</u> and he...um...  That's a fine house.  You look at that, and you know, there's nice people that live there.	I live there.
3 Really.  With the porch swing and everything...	Surest thing you know.

1 Hello.	I thought you had Play Practice.
2 Don't look good for "Trial of the Heart."	Well, then, it don't look good for the Huskies...
3 That's for sure.

1 Don't you think you should put them in water?	Why?
2 ...because if you don't, they die...

1 Going home, yeah.  I told them what you said...	What?
2 I told them what you said about the script...

1 Lookit that, up already.	That's why we filmfolk get along so well with you farmers.  Both up with the chickens.

1 And I might have something important to tell you...	What is it, a surprise?
2 That's right...

1 What courthouse?	Courthouse back in town.
2 Town ain't got no courthouse.	What?
3 Ain't got no courthouse.  Courthouse burnt down, 1960.

1 <u>This</u> is your movie, this is small town America.	Town in New Hampshire was small town America too.  Forty thousand dollars a day, to shoot on the street.  And <u>then</u> they kicked us out...

1 ...upset and impressionable...  Get me the Mayor...	...I was just talking to that girl in the other room.
2 ...overcome by the events around her, the presence of a high-powered...	I never touched her.  My mother's gr...
3 And a <u>fantasy</u> object...

1 Are you all right...?	I...
2 You got to get out of here...

1 You do...?	I just don't know what <u>order</u> they come in...

1 No.	Then what is the...?

1 Hi.  I hope I'm not disturbing...	She came in here, wait, she...I was giving her a massage...wait...Wait!  She came in here...she...  ...with respect...she took off her clothes, and she got in <u>bed</u>, I told her I could not--we don't know each other, you see...
2 ...we had a script conference...	I told her Thank You Very Much, but it was inconvenient because...uh... because...

1 Wally...	I know, I know.

1 What?	Who got their heads cut?
2 Uh.  Bob Barrenger, fella, <u>Cameraman</u>...	You said <u>three</u>...?
3 <u>Did</u> I?  I think you're mistaken.

1 Hi.	I'd prefer it if you didn't speak to me.
2 I...	...you know, there's nothing you could say, that could <u>possibly</u> make a difference, so, why don't you just save your breath.

1 That, that's <u>your</u> life's blood on the st...	I don't know what she's bitching about, she's flashed her tits in the last five movies...she'd bare her breasts to do a <u>voice</u> over.

2 Did my matzohs come?  Get some for everybody.  Thank you.  Lemme tell you about my first movie...

1 <u>Siddown</u>!	I really don't think you should be talking this way to a lady.
2 ...would you excuse me, please...

1 Marty...	Later for that, Walt, let's get this:  we need the "pages" for the new "Old Mill"...alright?  We need a new title, we need a...

1 Do something.	You tell me what to do, I'll do it.

1 ...the damn thing...	No, I'm serious, election's coming up, a lot of people are pretty upset...

1 I hate wax lips and red ants and pretzels without salt...	I hate the crayon Burnt Sienna and people who spit when they walk.

1 Like who?	Well, he's not president anymore, so why be petty.

1 Because it's quiet.  And he wants to talk.  Alise -- Once he saws you in half, it's bedtime...	What are you gonna talk about?
2 Probably you -- your brother -- school -- The solar system...The usual...	Then why are you putting on mascara?
3 I'm a little tired and it's just a pick-me-up.	But you only wore mascara when you and Daddy went on romantic dates...
4 Well Daddy and I are just friends now, and that's no reason not to wear mascara...	Or blush.  You look pale.

1 We make mistakes.  And we forgive each other.  Because we love each other, very m...	Where's Rache?  It's <u>Thursday</u>, we get to be with <u>Rache</u>!

1 How many devilled eggs can you eat?	Maybe twenty.

1 You swore.  You owe me a quarter.  Did you remember my egg carton?  I told you I needed my egg carton for seed planting today.	Absolutely Duncan I'm on top of everything.

1 She still packing for her trip?	I <u>killed</u> my math quiz, A-minus.

1 The guy <u>I</u> see is in the eighth grade at <u>Prep</u> School, and he laughs his <u>ass</u> off every time we talk about you.	But Rache...
2 A <u>suitable</u> boy, will be at <u>this</u> flagpole, <u>on</u> Monday, with a <u>very</u> expensive bike, and he will be a stone FOX if I have to call an <u>escort</u> service!

1 You touched it.	Then have a donut --
2 No.	Alright starve.

1 'In the still...still of the ni-ight...I held you... held you so ti-ight'...take it, man...	Doo-wop-doo-doo, <u>doo</u>-wop-doo-doo...

1 Not a lot, sweetie.  It's a country. Like Canada.  Only smaller.	Where are you, anyway?

1 In the still...still of the ni-ight...I held you...held you so ti-ight...	That's Rache's song!
2 Sugar.  I was slow dancing to that song before Rachel was even born.

1 It's not good enough.	No, it isn't.  Because it isn't everything.  And we want every- thing, don't we?

1 I've got it.  It's in the can, Cooper can wrap th...	We don't KNOW if you've got it, we haven't SEEN it yet!  Now go back and FINISH!

1 Just outside the big top, we're almo...	You're WHERE?
2 At the Big Apple Circus, it's the only big top I know.  I <u>said</u> I'd get 'em back tonight...	Jackie, <u>we</u> were taking them water- skiing for the <u>whole</u> weekend!
3 ...until the plan changed, when Jessie's mom gave us these tickets. What, Rachel. 'forgot' I told her?

1 You're still going to have to be dealing with me -- with us.  We should tell them together.	No.  You think this is going to help the kids then you do it.  You're on your own.

1 She's been talking about this little editing machine, it's only...	...a ridiculously <u>expensive</u> and <u>inappropriate</u> item, which her father and I have already <u>told</u> her she is <u>far</u> too young to own.  But <u>you</u> apparently want to <u>buy</u> her forgiveness, with...
2 <u>Forgiveness?</u>  For <u>what</u>, exactly?

1 She already hates me.  You've seen to that.	You're not terribly good at taking care of h...
2 I need practice.	Those are <u>my</u> children you're practicing on.  They deserve <u>first-</u> rate care.  Every minute.  Of every night.  And every day.

1 ...make some trips into the city. Sometimes, overnight.	Hey, any help you need, we'll cover.

1 You bet you are.	How the hell would you know?
2 I don't, but...	How would you know <u>anything</u>?

1 And you said...?	Beats me.  Ask your mom.

1 Hon, maybe your mom would like t...	...go to the park.  In the worst way.

1 Now we're going to have a fight, you and I.	Are we.
2 And I'm going to win.	Don't be too sure.

1 Thanks for coming out.	Neutral ground.  What's up?

1 Now Edna says you short-changed your last meds.  You can do presents and be comfortable at the same time, y'know.	Just want to be a little sharper. For a few minutes.

1 Oh my God.  Are you serious?	I think so...What do you think?
2 I think so too...

1 Why in the world would she t...	You took a fishing trip with the boys. Liked it so much, you took another.
2 I needed some time away.	...while she watched the kids.  Then, you booked this flat in Paris for your family's summer.  But she said...
3 '...the kids have camp.  Their friends are here.  Over there, I'll just be shopping in a language I don't even know.  My life, and the kids' lives, aren't here to service your mid-life crisis.'  Did it go like that?

1 I don't know what's wrong with that kid.	Maybe he's gay.
2 Don't ever say that.	What if he is?
3 He isn't.

1 Consuelo?	Yes, Mikey?
2 Do you have any brothers or sisters?	Yes.
3 Really? How many?	Four brothers and five sisters.
4 Wow.  Why did your parents have so many children? I mean, if they were poor, wouldn't it be better to have just one or two?	It was God's will.
5 But do you really believe in God? And heaven, hell and angels and all kind of stuff?	No.

1 Mom?	Yes, Mikey?
2 I was looking through Scooby's SATs practice books this afternoon and I took one of the practice tests. Guess what score I got?	What?
3 550 verbal, 520 math. And I'm only in fifth grade!

1 Well...yes. If it hadn't been for Hitler, he wouldn't have had to leave Europe. We would have been...European.	But then, in a sense, since you would never have met Dad if your family had stayed in Europe...if it weren't for Hitler, none of us would have been born.

1 Oh, I know, I know that. Well, sharing your story, your ups and downs, and so forth, can I hope, be an illuminating experience.	Yeah...How do we know we won't be exploited?

1 OK.	Tired of this shit...

1 You're not.	Good.  'Cause I...um...I really agreed with everything you had to say last week about how bad my story was...
2 That's good.	And I also agreed with what you said today about Marcus's story. It is a piece of shit.

1 Uh, well, anyway, so I'm looking for subjects for this documentary on teenage life in suburbia. Kind of an exploration of the mental psyche of its mythology. I wrote to Derrida to see if he'd like to do the narration. But everything's still kind of in development at this point.	Hunh.

1 Hey, um, Toby? I was wonderingIs the documentary almost finished?	Uh, yeah, we're getting there.
2 Can I see what you have so far?	Sureumyeah, as soon as I have a screening I'll let you know.
3 Thanks man.

1 Just get me a coke and don't argue with me, OK?	I'm not arguing.  I'm just telling you what the deal is--Congresswoman.
2 Look Cooper I don't care what my father says, if you embarrass me here you're going to regret it, understand?

1 I drew my gun, ran in the direction of the cries...violating the first rule of service...I let the Ambass- ador out of my sight.	What happened?
2 By the time I got back to the party our ambassador was face-down, in a bed of bloody azaleas.

1 Enjoying the tour so far?	Are you going to kill us?
2 I don't know.  If you gave me a reason to...

1 Why the hell didn't you tell us this was at stake!	Chemco's been developing nerve gas?

1 How goes the roll call?	We're secured.  Takeover team is in position and accounted for.

1 Just what the hell is he talking about?	We've...been developing a product... KZ 70709.

1 But, finally, one factor tipped the scales. We received information from a very re- liable source that your country was going to build one.	That's preposterous!  We have no such program!
2 The source was...shall we say, completely reliable.	The report is entirely untrue.  I can assure you of that.

1 Please, Mister President, I am extremely shy and do not wish to endure this sort of personal humiliation.  Here is the only other camera I have left. 	See!  See, I told you.

1 Yes!	General Schmuck?
2 Yes!  Who the hell is this?

1 Yes, sir.  One thing, Mister President.	Yes?
2 Under a condition red alert, the base will probably be sealed off and defended by the base security troops.	I am aware of what a condition red alert implies.
3 Well, sir, they may not allow the Special Service troops to enter the base.	That's a very wise deduction, General.
4 Thank you, sir.  But what shall I tell them to do if they are denied entrance?

1 But then, sir, why have you issued the order: Wing attack, Plan-R?	Because I thought it proper, Major.  Why else would you think I'd do it?

1 I still ask, why do they want disarmament?	Well, for the same reasons we do, sir. Don't you see?
2 No, Major, I don't.  They have no regard for human life.  They wouldn't care if they lost their whole country as long as they won.	Gee, sir, that last remark doesn't exactly make all the sense in the world.
3 Major, you're talking like one of them!	Well, I'm not, sir.  Honestly, sir.
4 Don't be offended, Major.  Our President holds the same views.	Don't you think he knows something about this, General Ripper?
5 I'll tell you what I do think.  If they say they're for disarmament, I say anyone who says they're for disarmament is either a traitor or a damned fool.	But, General, we're on our toes.  We haven't agreed to anything for years.  Inffact, a a lot of people say we never will.
6 But if they suddenly opened up and gave us the inspection we want, we'd agree, wouldn't we?	If they gave us what we think we need, yes, I guess we would.
7 And you'd like to see that?	General, what's good enough for the President and all the experts he's got working on the thing, is good enough for me.
8 Do you think we'd cheat?	No, sir.  I'm sure we wouldn't.
9 Do you think they would cheat?	Look, sir.  I'm no expert on the subject, but I've read some pretty sharp ideas the big boys have.  Like, say, both countries agreeing to a million dollar reward and international protection for anyone who gives evidence of cheating to the inspectors. You can't hide those things without a lot of people knowing about it.  And if I were going to try and hide a few, I wouldn't want to depend on the fact that some poor slob isn't going to run and blab for a million bucks.  We're as smart as they are, and if they cheat, or even hold back information, we'd pull right out.
10 Major, I hate to say this, but I think you've been enemy indoctrinated, and you don't even know it.

1 Have you received acknowledgements from every plane?	They're coming in now.
2 How long will it take to receive them all?	I'm not certain, Mister President.  The boys in CONCOM do the pencil work.

1 Roger, maintain.	Lothar, take your checks now.

1 Missiles!  Sixty miles off, heading in fast.  Steady track, they look like beam riders.	Roger, keep calling them.  Knock off auto-pilot, Ace.

1 Hey, King.  Somebody at Burpelson has a very perverted sense of humor.	Yeah?
2 I just got another blast on the CRM-114, and the damned thing decodes: Wing Attack, Plan-R.

1 Gee, we hate to leave you like this, Major Kong.  But there isn't anything we can really accomplish by sticking around.	Forget it.

1 Let's have a rundown on the damage, Lothar?	Everything still checks out okay.
2 Binky?

1 There are plenty of traitors and spies running around loose.	But the code is made up by General Ripper, and he's the only one left at the base who would know the code.
2 Nobody's loyalty is beyond question.  Besides, how do we know one of his staff didn't see it?	Come on, King.  That doesn't make sense.
3 Okay, how do we know they didn't shoot down one of our planes and torture the crew?  How do we know that?

1 In a matter of weeks, sufficient improvements for a dwelling space could be provided.	But they couldn't come out for a hundred years!
2 Mister President, man is an amazingly adaptable creature.  After all, the conditions would be far superior to those, say, of the Nazi concentration camps, where there is ample evidence most of the wretched creatures clung desperately to life.

1 That was really great.	Was it okay?
2 Yeah!	What did you guys think?
3 Slides go with it.	Behind me. I'm making these slides out of these old pictures and paintings and stuff.

1 Oh yeah? Oh, how'd you ship it over there, man? Federal Express? Hm? By the time it got there it'd be way cold and coagulated. Total waste. Cheese be stuck to the cardboard.	Buff, that slice is the difference between life and death for some half-dead Bangladeshi.
2 Yo, your gettin' me all upset here.	You should get upset. Everyone should get upset. When, when Hitler was greasing the Jews, people were saying, "Don't get me upset. Your bumming me out." My duty as a human being is to be pissed off. Jesus Christ, not that it makes a difference on the first fucking place. Nothing ever changes, man. Fifty years from now we're all gonna be dead and there'll be new people standing here drinking beer, eating pizza, bitching and moaning about the price of Oreos, and they won't even know we were ever here. And then fifty years after that those suckers will be dust and bones and there'll be all these generations of suckers trying to figure out what they're doing on this fucking planet and they'll all be full of shit. It's all so fucking futile.

1 Go!	... idiot! Open the damn door! Go, go, go, come on!

1 Yeah.	Come on.
2 Play it! Come on!

1 Yeah, he's told me. Burnfield. We all hear about Burnfield.	Mm. You know, does he tell you about how, uh, Jeff, Pony, started the band...?
2 Oh, you were in the band?	Yeah.

1 Hey, we're just having a conversation.	This is private property, my friend.

1 Yeah, we're all above that.	See, I wrote something about all this. Uh, it, it's a song about...
2 Well, play it, man.

1 Thanks, man!	I'll be in the car, okay?

1 It's okay. This kind of thing happens. It's just never happened to me. I'm sorry. It's true though. Mm. So, um, what's your TCB tattoo stand for? What's that about?	Taking care of business.
2 I'm sorry.

1 Erica, you coming?	Mm-mm.

1 No, that's not what I'm saying. I'm saying I don't need a limousine to know who I am, alright?	Right on. You know what? He doesn't need the limo, man.
2 I mean, you know, at least I admit that I don't know. I know that things are fucked up beyond belief and I know that I have nothing original to say about any of it, alright? I don't have an answer. I don't have a fucking message.	Okay, great. Well, now he's crying. Are you guys happy?
3 Oh, shut up, Tim. This isn't funny, man.

1 Hey, w-why don't you see if he's hiring, you know? Get an application?	That, that's Indian?

1 Oh! Trim it!	I hate that.
2 Sorry. Let's go back to the van right now.	No. I'm not going to the van, it's so gross. Come on. I'm doing my performance right now.
3 Okay, so maybe later.

1 It was a racial incident.	It was just something that got out of hand. Did anyone get hurt?
2 It got that close.	Okay, but nothing happened. Believe me, if I thought something really bad was going to happen, I would've done something.
3 Oh, yeah?	Yeah.
4 Okay, what would you have done.	I would've stopped it.
5 How?	I don't know. I would've done something. This is kind of hypothetical, isn't it? This place is so stupid. I can't believe we're sitting here in this mosh-pit of consumerism. With all these people eating their chunks of dead flesh...
6 Jeff. Jeff.	... like fucking robots. Look at those kids there.
7 Jeff. You know, I was talking to Mister Brooks yesterday. He has this friend in New York who wants to sublet his apartment for six-fifty a month. I could swing that. Six-fifty.	Sooze.

1 I've run out of words.	Wait. What, what are you saying?
2 I don't know. And I don't care that I don't know.	Well, what about us?
3 What about us? I'm moving away your staying here.	No, maybe not though. That, that's what I'm trying to say.
4 Maybe not? You think that I'm with somebody else and now it's maybe not?	Oh, no, no, no.
5 You're unbelievable.	Wait, no, I... Look, Sooze, I figured something out.
6 You did, huh? Good for you.	Oh, fuck it, man!

1 So, um, Pony, where are you staying? Are you staying at your mother's house?	No, no, they, uh, you know, that can be kind of a hassle, so , uh, you know, I just stay at the Four Seasons. It's easier.

1 What about this, huh? Go ahead, big man.	Camel jockey.
2 You know, why do you call me names? You know, I never hurt you. I'm only working here.	Yeah, yeah. That's the fucking problem.

1 Okay, now, you guys all take care, okay? Oh, man, I feel so good. I feel good 'cause I'm hanging out with you guys, man. You know? I mean, I forgot what it was like to just hang out.	Yeah.
2 And you know why it's so good? See, because, see, you guys are real. No, man, I mean it. You guys have a sense of humor. You live your lives, you know. It's simple, you know. The guys on the road, I mean, the band, all they talk about is scoring chicks... and Danny, all Danny talks about is money.

1 I hate it here. It's so ugly, it's like being dead. You got out of here, you know? I'm ready to go.	Yeah, but sometimes I try to figure out why I left in the first place, you know? I think about people and I wonder what they're doing.
2 Yeah.	I think about you. I mean, a lot.
3 Me?	Yeah, I have, I have, yeah.
4 Yeah, you know, when you called I thought, there's a name from the past.	Or the future, oh, no, no, I mean... I mean, we'll be working on that album cover, right?
5 Yeah, I know what you're saying.	You do?
6 Yeah. God, you showed up at such a weird time in my life.

1 Well, I called Erica's beeper. There's just no answer.	What are you? Her pimp? She said she might go get a drink first.
2 Well, I mean, she always answers her beeper.	Pal, she's a big girl, you know? I'm sure she's alright.
3 Yeah? Well, what'd she say?	About what?
4 About where she went. I mean, what bar?	She didn't say. Maybe she's at the bar at the hotel.
5 The bar at the hotel? She told you that? What did she say exactly?	Well, Dad, she said she wanted to suck my cock.

1 Make a move. Greasecake. Towel-head.	Hey, Tim, you know what? You win.
2 Fucking drunk, huh?	You have the largest penis. Can we go please?

1 What?!	You piece-a-shit bug zapper!

1 Di, are you okay?  We can skip the girl party this week.	Everything's fine.  I'm just having a little trouble keeping my frown upside down.

1 C'mon, Luce, people do it in the movies all the time.	And they get caught!
2 That's right.  So all we have to do is watch a bunch of movies and learn from their mistakes.

1 Jack, I think I should get a job.	But we agreed your job is running the baby machine...
2 I know, but that was before.	Ah!  I almost forgot gas for the baby machine.  I'll grab your Snickers and get a place in line.

1 Hat-trick?	He is the Great One...

1 It was Lucy!  Lucy went to the cops!	Remember, Kansas, every time you point a finger you've got three more pointing back at you.
2 She's been the weak tit on this mama cat since the beginning.	That you?
3 Yeah, hold on.	Just call me later.  I gotta get some smokes for Grandma.
4 Don't use big bills!	For a pack of cigs?  I use her food stamps.

1 Look, maybe I can watch a PG movie... I'll just say I'm counting dirty words for Sunday School.	That's okay, Hannah.  It was silly to think we could learn to rob a bank from watching movies.  Sex - you can learn from movies.  But robberies?  There's no way.

1 Yeah.  This summer at church camp?  I'm pretty sure I had, y'know, an orgasm.	Hold up, hold up.  Any sentence that starts with "at church camp" ain't leading to the big "O."

1 Kansas, I want you to meet someone special.	Oh, Jesus Christ, Mom!  Like my life ain't a great big pile-of-shit 'cause you're in here?  Now I have to add, "P.S. My mom's a dyke" too?
2 What?!  Hush up, you mouthy little shit!	Hey, don't "mouthy shit" me - I'm outta here.
3 Wait, Petunia.  Mommy's a little amped up - didn't get her yard time this morning.  Mink ain't my bitch.  She's a specialist... in banks.

1 Say, you're not really smuggling opium these days,  are you?	Where's the bar?

1 If I could be of any help...	I'm sorry, Mr. Gillis, but I just don't think it's any good. I found it flat and banal.
2 Exactly what kind of material do you recommend?  James Joyce? Dostoosvsky?

1 O.K.  Where's the cash?	Where's the story? I bluffed it out with a few notions of my own. It's really just a springboard. It needs work.
2 I was afraid of that.	I've got twenty pages of notes. I've got a pretty good character for the man.

1 Look at this street.  All card- board, all hollow, all phoney. All done with mirrors.  I like it better than any street in the world.  Maybe because I used to play here when I was a kid.	What were you -- a child actress?
2 I was born just two blocks from this studio.  Right on Lemon Grove Avenue.  Father was head elec- trician here till he died.  Mother still works in Wardrobe.	Second generation, huh?
3 Third.  Grandma did stunt work for Pearl White.  I come from a picture family.  Naturally they took it for granted I was to become a great star.  So I had ten years of dramatic lessons, diction, dancing. Then the studio made a test.  Well, they didn't like my nose -- it slanted this way a little.  I went to a doctor and had it fixed.  They made more tests, and they were crazy about my nose -- only they didn't like my acting.	Nice job.
4 Should be.  It cost three hundred dollars.	Saddest thing I ever heard.
5 Not at all.  It taught me a little sense.  I got me a job in the mail room, worked up to the Stenographic. Now I'm a reader...	Come clean, Betty.  At night you weep for those lost closeups, those gala openings...
6 Not once.  What's wrong with being on the other side of the cameras? It's really more fun.	Three cheers for Betty Schaefer! I will now kiss that nose of yours.
7 If you please.

1 Last time I saw you was someplace very gay.  I remember waving to you. I was dancing on a table.	Lots of people were.  Lindbergh had just landed in Paris.  Come on in.

1 Just a minute, you!	Yeah?
2 You're a writer, you said.	Why?

1 Now what is it?  Where's the fire?	I've lost my car.
2 Oh...and I thought it was a matter of life and death.	It is to me.  That's why I came to this house.  That's why I took this job -- ghost writing!
3 Now you're being silly.  We don't need two cars.  We have a car.  And not one of thuse cheap new things made of chromium and spit.  An Isotta-Fraschini.  Have you ever heard of Isotta-Fraschinis?  All hand-made.  Cost me twenty-eight thousand dollars.

1 Hold me tighter.	Come midnight, how about blind- folding the orchestra and smash- ing champagne glasses on Max's head?
2 You think this is all very funny.	A little.
3 Is it funny that I'm in love with you?	What's that?
4 I'm in love with you.  Don't you know that? I've been in love with you all along.

1 I can still see myself in the line: Bebe Daniels, Marie Prevost, Mabel Normand ... Mabel was always stepping on my feet ...What's the matter with you, darling?  Why are you so glum?	Nothing is the matter.  I'm having a great time.  Show me some more.
2 All right.  Give me this.  I need it for a moustache.  Now close your eyes.

1 That's a lie!  They still want me!	No, they don't.
2 What about the studio? What about De Mille?	He was trying to spare your feelings. The studio wanted to rent your car.
3 Wanted what?	De Mille didn't have the heart to tell you.  None of us has had the heart.
4 That's a lie!  They want me, they want me!  I get letters every day!	You tell her, Max.  Come on, do her that favor.  Tell her there isn't going to be any picture -- there aren't any fan letters, except the ones you write yourself.
5 That isn't true! Max?

1 Some men are here.  They asked for you.	I'm not here.
2 That's what I told them.	Good.
3 They found your car in the garage.  They are going to tow it away.

1 We've come for the car.	What car?

1 Well, it's one way to get her down stairs.	Okay.  And let's have the car right outside.

1 But the Power Source, Zaltar.	It couldn't be helped. The city will have to make do with three.
2 But what will happen?	The Guardians will be angry. They may even send me to the Phantom Zone. You see, I didn't really have permission to borrow it. I must go explain to them...

1 Why did she have to show up now?	Eliminate her.
2 That's easy for you to say, Bianca.	You can do it. You're the most powerful woman on Earth.
3 Am I? Still?

1 Is this Nigel's doing?	It's a warning, that's for sure.
2 Maybe it was just an accident.	There's no such thing as an accident. Everything has meaning, if you can read the signs.

1 Of Course I don't hate you. I  don't hate anyone.	What do you feel about me?

1 You think so?	I don't see why not.
2 But what if---it wasn't real?	Feelings are real. Once you've had them, they're yours forever.

1 She's right. They'll string her up.	Do you want to come to Argo City?

1 Nurse! Nurse!	You can't escape from me that easily. I'm afraid you don't know who I am.
2 Nurse!	Don't think I'm weak, just because I'm a woman. I have Power. Give in, stop fighting me, Ethan. I always get what I want.
3 Nurse! Help !

1 Selena, I've been thinking. It's time I settled down---and I don't know a nicer lady to settle down with than you.	Why George, are you proposing?
2 Marry me, Selena. The hardware store doesn't bring in much now, but...	George---I thought you'd never ask.

1 Jimmy, would you please put those poor flowers in water before they die?	Oh, sure.

1 You see, a tree is a living thing.	Can you create life?

1 Linda babes! There's this all-night party at Eddie's... his folks are away...	Oh, I don't know. I'm not signed out for an overnight.
2 Go back, sign in, and climb out the bathroom window. McCloskey's always zonked out: she'll never hear you.	It doesn't seem right.
3 Please, as a favour to me? So I won't  be the only girl?

1 Thank you both so much. It was a lovely lunch, Mrs. Danvers. I had a wonderful time. And you're a terrific chess player MR. Danvers.	What? Me?
2 Sure. Mate in five moves.

1 You better have a pretty good explanation for this, Selena.	We are in great danger. A being has come to Earth with powers far beyond those of anyone member of the Craft.

1 Where is inner space?	It's everywhere. But water is always the door.

1 There's no way out of the Zone. No one's ever escaped. That's why they send the criminals here.	If there's a way in, there must be a way out.
2 No, that's not true---there's well...no--

1 Yeah? What do you want?	Buddy, are we in trouble.

1 I just think Ricky would rather not get a bowling lesson in front of the other kids.	The kid needs a man to show him --
2 The kid will do fine on his own.  Give it your best shot, Ricky!

1 I just can't stand this.	Hey, he'll be all right. Believe me Lana, I know. I was a late bloomer myself.
2 It isn't only that he's small for his age. how would you like to be the only kid in town without a father?  Look at him, he's stewed to the gills in the middle of the afternoon.	But all he had was chocolate milk.
3 I mean him.

1 Gee, I always loved porch swings.	Me too. That's why I put this one up.

1 Do you really know Superman?	We get together sometimes.

1 Name?	Gus Gorman.

1 I believe they're laundered and sent to some charitable institution. I don't know what the heck they do with 'em. Maybe they use them for dust rags, or pen wipers...	Or socks.
2 Yes! That never occurred to me.  Her ya go, buddy, single-malt.  Gus, my friend, you're a genius. Okay, a naughty genius, but hell, nobody's perfect.	'Cause I know about getting' them half-centses?

1 Always making yourself beautiful for me, aren't you?  So, Gus, can you make Vulcan do what I want it to? You didn't answer me, pal.  Did you hear about that prison riot last week? It seems they were complaining about rats in the cells...	Yeah, yeah, I can do it.
2 When?	First question got to be "Where."
3 What?	Not "What." Don't need a genius to figure out "what." Need a genius to figure out "where."  He says I'm a genius, your don --  Brother! Bubba! Your Bubba!  See, if y'all don't want them to trace it back, you got to punch this in from someplace nobody'd ever think off. Some little rinky- dink operation with a little mickey- mouse computer. ROSS It's got to be someplace you can sneak into.

1 Is this blackmail?	Don't be getting' racist with me, man.
2 Is this whitemail?	Fair's fair.
3 What do you want?

1 Hey listen, I didn't know your mama was comin' by...	Sister! I'm his sister!

1 Oh. I'm Lana Lang. This is Ricky.	We've already met.
2 And this is...  ...Clark.  My friend is around here somewhere, I'll just look for...	I'm sorry, I'm in a real hurry.  See you around, pal.

1 Well, don't let me keep you from anything.	I'm in no rush.  So what do you have in mind?

1 Come on, will you?  We've got to get ready before he gets here.	Gus?
2 Superman. The boy you left behind.

1 85,000 dollars.	Missing????
2 Embezzled, Mr. Webster.  Stolen from the firm.

1 You mean...you mean...Vera! Vera! The magnitude of this!!!	Today coffee----
2 TOMORROW THE OIL!

1 He's coming! He's going to hurt me!	Don't bet on it!

1 Clark, everything I was saying -- can't you see I only say it because I really care?	Really?
2 Of course, that's what friends are for.

1 Who ????	Listen, I've got to give you credit. Your disguise is nearly perfect. I mean, if you fooled me, and I am nobody's fool --
2 No, of course not, Lois. You just get carried away sometimes. Believe me, I understand --

1 Clark . . . it doesn't matter . . . we can move . . .	Do you . . . ah . . . want to step outside?

1 . . . Superman?. . . . .	Lois, I really don't see why --
2 Clark, stop feeling so threatened every time you hear his name. Nobody expects you to be what you're not.

1 Well done, Miss Teschmacher.	Why am I doing this? Why am I here?
2 Is this a philosophy seminar? No. This is getaway.

1 -- as the keeper of the archives of Krypton, it falls to me to tell you of the darkest episode in our planets history.	Now This I want to hear.
2 For many eons the peoples of our world have lived together in harmony. Then there appeared among us three anti-social elements - what on Earth are classified as "criminals."	My kind of people.
3 The three proved - after exhaustive efforts - incapable of rehabilitation. Now as you know, we had no death penalty -	Sensible enough.
4 And so our scientists constructed, from an irreversible mathematical equation, the Phantom Zone. In it we imprisoned these three arch-villains for all eternity.	No possibility for parole?
5 The Elders have, of course, thought long and hard about that question.	I asked the right question.
6 The one danger we have considered is that the Phantom Zone might - we cannot predict - just might be cracked by a nuclear explosion in space. I cannot say I am glad you asked me that -	I didn't ask her anything . . .

1 So --  I hope you like it.	Like it? It's magnificent!  Not that it couldn't use a woman's touch. Especially around dinner time.
2 Dinner. Oh yes.  I'm sorry, I just never do much about that.  But tonight -- I mean, anything you want, Lois.

1 No drinks . No movie. This is the last time I take a charter flight.	Where is his home, Lex Luthor? Which way?
2 North. Keep going North!

1 So this is the planet Houston . . .	What shall we do now?
2 Stay. I will come to you.

1 I've never been in a place like this before.	This is Metropolis after hours! This is what you'll be writing about. C'mon, let's dance.

1 Hello, Lacy. Can anybody break a twenty? The cabbie didn't have any change.	. . . Let me get my purse.

1 The President is about to speak. I don't think it's going to be good news.	You always overreact, Clark. How terrible can it be?

1 Lex, we all appreciate how you've supported us lately and . . . uh . . . in recognition of your hard work we've decided to increase your commission to 12 percent.	Gee guys, that's swell of you. But  . . . I've got another idea.

1 Tone down our headlines? Lacy, that's all the common man reads!	I'd just like to have a little less sensationalism.
2 Less sensational papers go broke. I thought I taught you long ago the business of newspapers is business.

1 What's that?	Our other dinner guest.

1 Hey! He looks . . . normal.	He's . . .  beautiful. Perfect.

1 I hadn't counted on this but . . .  . . . of course - the power of the sun has given him internally generated heat. I am a ...	You are . . .
2 What? A genius? . . . an inspiration?	You are . . . nothing. I am father now.

1 I'm not going anywhere.	I'll ignore that . . . So, I created a monster who didn't work nearly as well as I might have liked -- you were clearly his better  --  he needed more energy, more power.
2 Which explains why you sent his organic matter to the sun.	Precisely. And then it came to me. My greatest ever plan. I made a deal with some minor league Bad Boys. Arms Dealers, Renegades Generals, You know the type. With you gone, we'll make a fortune rearming the world.
3 You'd risk worldwide nuclear war for your own personal financial gains.	Nobody wants war. I'd just like to keep the threat alive.
4 A mind is a terrible thing to waste, Lex Luthor. And you've wasted yours on this foul monstrosity. I'm taking you in.

1 Ah! The guest of honor at last! And about time, too!	We're running out of smoke.

1 Mother...	I know son, I know...

1 Stop him, Clark!	He may have a gun!
2 Oh, for God's sake!

1 You! The girl from the volcano!  Kryptonite...	Help! I mean  --  I can't stop saying it. Silly, isn't it  -  There's nothing to worry about. Help! See.
2 What are you doing here?	Screaming
3 Besides that.	He wants to see you. Lex Luthor.
4 The bald man! The one who tried to kill me?	The way you describe him doesn't really do him justice.
5 I'd better get you down.

1 Damn!  This will get him.	Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen.,

1 The door jam, Miss Teschmacher. This Ethiopian shmendrick here, in his simple, unconscious way, needed something to wedge the door open, the better to inhale the flies that form such an  important part of his diet. So he grabs something from the table...	We just take it?
2 What do you suggest, my dear?	The least we can do is leave him another door jam.

1 Oh. Why? does he live up here?	Not exactly. But it's his kind of neighborhood.
2 What are you going to do to him?

1 Need I ask who's favored to collect at the end of this week.	On the salary he pays me, I can't make my rent without it.

1 Here's the story on that East 19th Street murder spree. Page one with a banner headline seems about right to me.	It does, huh?  Clark Kent, I'd like you to meet Lois Lane.

1 What color underwear am I wearing?	Pink.

1 But, to someone from the planet Krypton, this substance would be lethal because of its high level of radioactivity. Kryptonite! Ah, Kryptonite! That's the stuff!	You mean bullets and fire and all that can't hurt him, but this kind of rock --
2 Will kill him! And I'm going to have a piece of the rock! Miss Teschmacher, pack your --

1 Nice! Most of California would have been destroyed. Millions of people would've been killed! The West Coast as we know it would have  --	--  Dropped into the sea!  Bye-bye California! Hello, new West Coast! Gold Coast! My Coast.  And now...well...  I left my heart in San Francisco...

1 I'm glad to hear that Zoe's okay.	Are you still in touch?
2 Not really.  The last time I saw her was at that clinic.  That was a long time ago.	Which one?
3 Which one?	Which clinic?
4 I don't remember the name.  It was near a beach.	Sunnyridge.  That was a long time

1 That's my daughter.  Or it may be the police to tell me that they've found her dead.  She's a drug addict.	Why are you telling me this?
2 I'm telling you this because... we've all lost our children, Mr. Ansel.

1 So what brings you out tonight?	Well, Sam, I might as well tell you the truth.  It's this lawsuit you've gotten yourself all involved with. I want you to drop the damned thing.

1 What are you thinking?	Tomorrow I'm going to put Sean on the bus.  He won't want to go.  He never does.  He'll cry and want to hold on to me.
2 That's because he misses you.

1 Billy loved to see his kids in the bus.  They always sat in the back, so they could wave to each other. It comforted him.	From what?
2 From what?	Did he have any particular problems that you knew of?  Financial pressures...run-ins with the law...
3 No, nothing like that.  Billy's wife, Lydia, died of cancer a few years ago.  He took over raising the children by himself.  It was obvious how much he missed Lydia.	You talked about it?
4 No.  I saw it on his face.

1 He never took his eyes off his mother, even as he moved to sit beside Nicole.  He looked frightened.	Why would he be frightened?
2 I don't know.  But it was weird in terms of what happened next.  Sean was still watching his mother.

1 Is this mine?	Yes.  It's a present.
2 From you?	No.  From Mr. Stephens.  That was him on the phone just now.  He was calling to see how you were.
3 Who's Mr. Stephens?

1 I don't like thinking about the accident.  I don't even remember it happening.  Besides, it just makes people feel sorry for me, and...	You hate that.

1 I have no questions.	Thank you, Nicole.

1 You always think you're prepared for these things.	Tell me about it.
2 How old is she?	Almost three.
3 Is this it?	Perfect.
4 Here we go.	Thanks.

1 Some more wine?	I'm afraid this meat is overdone.
2 I'm sorry about that, Mr. Stephens. Would you like to try the fish?	What is it?
3 Poached salmon.

1 Been drinking since high school. Fucked himself up.  Used to be smart enough.	Any criminal record?
2 Probably half a dozen traffic convictions.  Drunk driving.  Lost his licence.  That's why he don't work no more.	Can't get off that shitty dump they live on.  What little money comes in goes to booze.
3 How does the family survive?	Don't know.  Food banks, welfare, church charity.  They scrape by.

1 You believe that the bus driven by Mrs. Driscoll was going at seventy- two miles an hour at this time?	I told you I was positive.  The speedometer was large and easy to see from where I was.

1 That's too high.  I'll never reach it.	Oh.  I better get some spackle.

1 Well, there's the Hamiltons.  Joe and Shelly Hamilton.	Yeah, right.

1 He's somewhere...	Thanks, I see him...

1 Went over to Philly yesterday an' seen the folks...it's nice you send them the fifty a month...	See my mother?
2 I only had a few hours.

1 Blessings on thee, the both...well... Gotta run now.  See you two kids later!	Hurry back.

1 Susie, you're very much in my thoughts today.	Why?
2 What a question, dear, with that newspaper in your hand...	Did Sidney tell you about it?
3 Yes, he phoned.  I don't know this boy too well.  Anything in these charges?

1 Susie, did you know about this accusation...?	No...
2 Before you leave, son, I'll answer your question---Susan Hunsecker is the injured party here!  Or will I be hearing next that I don't even have my sister's welfare at heart...

1 Say hello to Sidney Falco.  Tickle him - he's been a bad boy tonight. He called you my fat friend.	I don't believe it.

1 Frankly, J.J., I don't think you got the cards to blitz me.	I don't?
2 Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think so...	I'll listen one more minute.

1 Well he's got her in a tizzy, I'll tell you that!	Sure, he steams her up - wants her to stand on her own two feet and all that jazz!
2 And who's feet is she on now?	Presumably yours...  That's according to St. Dallas.
3 What's this boy got that Susie likes?	Integrity - acute, like indigestion.
4 What does that mean - integrity?	A pocket fulla firecrackers - looking for a match!  It's a new wrinkle to tell the truth... I never thought I'd make a killing on some guy's "integrity".

1 Listen with care - this will cost me everything, so you know I'm telling you the truth!	You're incapable of the truth...
2 Susie, there's nothing wrong with Dallas!  Your brother and I arranged it all. And if the Leslie boy is still a squooshy item in your life, forget it! - your brother arranged that one, too!  I don't usually give away presents; but this is my gift to you: Get out of here!  Leave this man!

1 What's your favorite ribbon to go around your favorite chocolates?	Let's wait till Christmas - it's more legitimate then.

1 What do you want all of a sudden - Lady Godiva...?  Where's my other shoe?	What kind of an act is this?

1 You ought to be used to me by now.	I'm used to you...
2 No.  You think I'm a hero.  I'm no hero.  I'm nice to people where it pays me to be.  I gotta do it too much on the outside, so don't expect me to kow-tow in my own office.  I'm in a bind right now with Hunsecker so --  Every dog has his day!  Lock up and leave the key.

1 You're talking very fast.	Well, I'll tell you what - excuse me for breathing, will ya?  How do you like it?  He comes to my office and -

1 Do you think J.J. likes Steve...?	Frankly, yes, to my surprise.  He thinks he's very gifted - those boys'll go a big mile, he thinks.

1 I tried to reach you twice -	What do you do for that hundred a week.  Fall out of bed?
2 Jimmy, I'm on my way inside right now to talk to Hunsecker.  I can promise you -	Joan, call a cop!  We'll arrest this kid for larceny!

1 Steve...what you tried to do today...you tried to take me up on a high mountain...I couldn't go all the way...I failed you...  Will you forgive me?  Have I lost you, Steve?  Have I...?	Well, maybe I was wrong, too... But there's no doubt, Susie, that we have to face some serious things...
2 No one's ever stood up to my brother the way you did.	But you didn't do much about it, Susie.  You walked out, and there I was...solo...and not too good at that.
3 I just didn't think that I could antagonize him, Steve -- for OUR sake, I mean.	Susie, I was there for OUR sake, too.  But what a world it would be if we were all afraid to learn to walk and talk because it might offend poppa!  By the way, I think your brother was completely responsible for the smears...

1 Do you know about the chip?	What chip?
2 They have it in a vault at Cyberdyne...  It's gotta be from the other one like you.

1 Where we going?	We have to leave the city, immediately.  And avoid the authorities.
2 Can I stop by my house?	Negative.  The T-1000 will definitely try to reacquire you there.
3 You sure?	I would.

1 Listen to me, very carefully, okay?  You're not a terminator any more.  Alright?  You got that? You can't just go around killing people!	Why?
2 Whattaya mean, why?  'Cause you can't!	Why?
3 You just can't, okay?  Trust me on this.

1 Excellent.	Yeah, I thought you'd like this place.

1 Is it dead?	Terminated.

1 Mom?  You okay?	I couldn't... oh, God.  You... came here... to stop me?
2 Uh huh.

1 It has helped me a lot to have a goal, something to look forward to.	And what it that?

1 My CPU is a neural-net processor... a learning computer.  But Skynet presets the switch to "read-only" when we are sent out alone.	Doesn't want you thinking too much, huh?
2 No.

1 It's not just a dream.  It's real, you moron! I know the date is happens!!	I'm sure it feels very real to you --
2 On August 29th 1997 it's going to feel pretty fucking real to you, too!  Anybody not wearing number two million sunblock in gonna have a real bad day, get it?	Relax now, Sarah --
3 You think you're alive and safe, but you're already dead.  Everybody, you, him...  everybody... you're all fucking dead!

1 I guess you admire musicians.	Some.
2 Don't. This is like a criminal investigation, David. Musicians, morticians, doctors, lawyers, butchers, clerks. They're all the same.

1 What?	Your manner.
2 My manner? Why don't you go downstairs, get a cup of coffee and calm down? What's the matter, Emmi? What's going on with you? What's wrong?

1 Steve.	There have been messages for you.  A Lieutenant David Wills called from the Allied Kommandatura Cultural Affairs office in Wiesbaden. I don't know who he is.

1 I keep hearing you helped a lot of Jews to escape. How did you do that?	I don't remember in detail, there were so many.
2 Did you call someone you knew?	I may have, as... as I said, I simply don't remember.
3 Let me me help you, then. You picked up the phone and made a call -  'Hello, Adolf? Wilhelm speaking. Listen, old pal, there's a Jew-boy musician I want you to help. He needs a permit to get to Paris.'

1 Please stop playing these games with me. Why you should bring up the name of another conductor is beyond my understanding.	I'll tell you why. You remember we talked about you playing for Hitler's birthday?  And you told me that Goebbels got to your doctors first, that you were tricked?
2 Yes, that's what happened.

1 Good, and according to your questionnaire, Helmuth, you never joined the Nazi Party.	Me? Never.  Never.

1 Was a member of...?  Speak up?	I was a member of the Communist Party. I was a communist. That's what Hinkel had over me. He knew everything. He held that over me. That's how he made me co-operate.
2 Oh, I see, he made you co-operate. And now are you a communist again?	You don't know what it's like to wake up every single morning of your life terrified, you don't know that - 

1 You ever seen Adolf Hitler's eyes when he was making a speech? I've seen 'em on films.	Yes.
2 Was looking at Furtwngler like that?	I don't know what you mean, Major.
3 When you got to the crescendo.

1 Here you go.  You're a Bob's Girl now.  Nancy will check you out.	I won't let the fat kid down.

1 I'm going to a movie, kiddo. See ya'.  You and Matt have a good time.	We will, kiddo.

1 Didn't see the war.  I was born after, in the ruins.  Grew up there.  Starving.  Hiding from the H-K's.	The what?
2 Hunter Killers.  Patrol machines. Build in automated factories. Most of us were rounded up, put in camps...for orderly disposal.

1 Sleep.  It'll be light soon.	Okay.  Talk some more.
2 About what?	About where you're from.

1 What's that?	Nitroglycerin, basically. Bit more stable.  I learned howto make it when I was a kid.

1 Sarah.	We did it, Kyle.  We got it.

1 Here, drink some of this...	Lieutenant, are you sure it's them?  Maybe I should see the ...bodies.
2 They've already been identi- fied.  There's no doubt.

1 Go!  Go!  He's got her.	Suspect westbound on Olympic.  Grey sedan.  Has hostage, repeat...

1 I'm so sorry.	Please, don't do that...

1 Let's talk to whoever can get this over with...	Hold on...  They want your driver's license number.

1 I'll wait.	It's not like anyone could actually open it.

1 Nice.	Hm?  Oh, yes.

1 Take the picture out.	What's wrong?
2 Take the picture out of the frame and show it to me.	I don't...

1 My name's not Christine.  It's not my real...	Who the fuck cares?

1 Where'd you get that... ?	... what... ?
2 That gun.  That... that's not automatic.  The guard had an automatic...

1 They gave me a free jacket at the door.	They'll be wanting it back.
2 Not after I'm done with it.  Actually, I've been here.  In grad-school I bought crystal-meth from the maitre d'.	Which grad-school?

1 How did those... ?	You're part of it...
2 What?  Connie...

1 The last few days, um... I've been thinking... had a lot of spare time.  I want to tell you... I'm starting to understand why you left me.  I've been resenting you for it, maybe, but ... I want to apologize, for all of it.  For shutting you out, for not being there.  I...  Anyway, I hope you can forgive me.	There's nothing to forgive.
2 It would mean a lot to me... if you and I could be friends.  If I could have you back in my life... in some small way.  It would be important.	Of course, Nick...

1 One guarantee.  Payment's entirely at your brother's discretion and, as a gift, dependent on your satisfaction.	You mean, I don't like it, he doesn't pay?
2 It's never happened.  We've never had an unsatisfied customer.	You mean, <u>dis</u>satisfied.
3 That's right -- you're a left-brain word fetishist.

1 I've been so lonely.	I can't tell you how <u>not</u> interested I am.
2 Don't be nervous.  They said you'd be nervous.	Don't take another step.

1 All the time I've known you, you've never once asked about him.	He came to my mind recently, that's all.

1 What the fuck... ?!	Why are you following me?
2 I don't know what you're talking about.  I'm just driving...

1 Christ... I can't believe it... invisible ink?	You're joking.
2 It's what they do.  It's like... being toyed with by a bunch of...  Depraved children.

1 The children.  The children Hugh Crain built the house for.  The children he never had.	Come on.  These are the typically sentimental gestures of a depraved industrialist.

1 I gave my key to the gate to Todd, but the Dudleys'll be here in the morning.	Do we still get paid for the week?
2 You get your money.

1 We're fucked.  We're in a haunted house and we can't get out until the morning.	You don't really believe it's haunted... Do you believe in ghosts?
2 That depends on your definition of ghosts.  I'm going to check on her, and then I'm going to stay awake.	All night?
3 Yeah.	You want company?
4 Maybe someday.

1 You wrote that you had trouble sleeping.	Yes, because someone was always keeping me awake.  Ever since I was little.  That was my job.  I took care of my mother and I had to be there for her all night long, and she woke up all the time.  And after she died, well, it's been a few months, but I still, I still wake up, it's... a habit.  I know we've only known each other a couple of hours, but I'm really glad to be with people who let me talk about this.  I'm really happy to be here with you.

1 What is that tune?	I don't know.  A lullaby I guess. My mother used to hum it to me. And her mother before that, and so on.  Hugh Crain, would you care to dance?

1 You hear the vibrations in the wire.  There's a magnetic pulse in the wires, you feel it.  I could test it.	Test it.

1 Your fear of him was real.  That's all the ghost anyone needs.	How could you do this to people?

1 Why?	Why'd she kill herself?
2 Yes.	She was unhappy.
3 Why?	Can't say.  Haven't been here that long.  Well, it's Labor Day, gotta get to work.

1 A monster?  But he built this for the woman he loved, like the Taj Mahal.	The Taj Mahal wasn't a palace, it was a tomb.  Why didn't he tell us?

1 That's so sad.	There's hundreds of them.  This must be a record of the children who died at the mills, like Luke said.
2 Before he painted your name over Mister Crain.

1 Nell, what happened?	Carolyn showed me where she hid him, hid him with all the ones he killed --

1 Hey, I thought you weren't a buffet person.	I'm a gracious host.

1 I mean, Gordon must weigh a good four hundred pounds.	Heavier than that now.  But are there any drugs in that stomach to back up your story.
2 As it happens.  I didn't make that part up.	And where is this guest?  Don't they want to interview him.
3 I don't know everyone here.  He was so traumatized he split.  Maybe he was Gordon's <u>pusher</u>.

1 Who done it, then?	Huh?
2 Snuffed her.

1 You should talk to Elaine.  That was her best friend.	She didn't write to me, did she.
2 She didn't know what to say.  I thought someone should say something. To someone.  With me it was, I don't know -- Jenny liked me for some reason.  I felt like I owed her.	Who'd Jenny get it off of -- this grass or whatever?
3 Not me, man.  I'm no drug dealer, what you think.	I think you didn't get that lot in the Navy, doing your National Service.
4 I already told you, man.  Corcoran.  Know what that is?  State prison.	Nick's a nick, n' it?  No matter what state you're in.  State of remorse, most likely -- for gettin' caught.
5 But that's not me anymore.  That's when I was into the gang lifestyle.  That's not who I am now.  Five years in the joint -- that's it for me, man.

1 What's so fucking funny?	Those aren't guards.  They're valets.

1 Hey, Elaine.  You even know what he's saying half the time?	No, but I know what he means.

1 Disappointed.	She never told Eddie, though.
2 She never told anyone else.  About the convict strain -- or is it stain?  No, I was privileged.  I was someone who helped Jenny efface her past.	How'd you manage that, then.
3 When I'm not honing my craft in episodic television I do double-duty as a voice coach.  Not that her accent would have hobbled her progress.  Not with that look.	Yeah, well, she started all that in London.
4 Modelling.	Learnin' 'ow to speak proper.  Central School of Speech and Drama. It's no doddle gettin' in there, y'know. At seventeen.  They offered her a place at RADA n' all, only she'd've had to wait till the next session and she was always in hurry to get on, was Jenny.  She could talk posh without any training, when she was knee-high to a grasshopper.  Show up the old man, you know.

1 Jenny was supposed to come to my place that night.  She called me, asked if she could come over.  She and Terry had been -- having some trouble.  Lately.  I don't know about what.  On this occasion, it reached some sort of crisis point.	She told you all about my details but not about his.  Lovely.
2 She'd never called me like that before. She sounded more ... pissed off -- angry -- than upset or afraid.  But she never turned up.  I called the house but only got the answer machine.  When they found her ... she'd been going the wrong way. Not the direction she'd have gone if she'd been coming to see me.  Or coming <u>straight</u> to see me.  Who knows.  Maybe she just wanted to drive.

1 She used to tell me she'd turn me in.  Little kid.  Ten year old.  "If you're naughty, Dad, I'll tell on ya."  She didn't want me sent down again, see. When I was planning some job.  "I'll tell 'em, Dad, I promise I will.  Here, look, I'm calling the Old Bill right now" -- picking up the telephone.  I can see her, the phone in her hand.  Became a sort of joke between us.  Only it wasn't a joke.	She never would have turned you in, not in a million years.
2 I know that.  But as time went on ... well, it <u>wasn't</u> a joke, was it?  She had a feeling about it -- about the last job -- how long I'd get the hook for.  Said she wouldn't be there this time when I got out.

1 Been away a lot.	Where else?

1 He's expecting you?	I doubt it.

1 It's been five minutes and I'm packing to leave again.  I can't believe this.	That's right, your life is Shit, and I'm to blame.  It's that simple.

1 ...You don't like the music out there?	It's OK, I guess. No, I don't really. I'm not big on music, ordinarily.

1 ...I'm not certain I'll have a career at all, and if I do, I'll probably be a veterinarian.	...Uh-huh.
2 I do appreciate the interest you've taken, though.	Ah... it's nothing.
3 I'm only sorry that I didn't play better for you. I know it would've made you happy. You know what you are?	Huh.
4 You're an enthusiast.	Huh. Yeah. Maybe...

1 A goose, friend. I was chasing a wild goose. Ed, have you ever heard of venture capital?	Uh--
2 Well, it's the wildest goose there is. Risk money. Very speculative. Except, Ed, in certain situations, it's not, see? I thought I had a prospect here. Well, I make the haul up and this lousy so-and-so tells me his situation has changed--all his capital's gonna be tied up in expansion plans of his own. Thank you, mother! Pop goes another bubble! It's only the biggest business opportunity since Henry Ford and I can't seem to interest a soul!	That right.
3 It's called dry cleaning. You heard me right, brother, 'dry cleaning'-- wash without water, no suds, no tumble, no stress on the clothes. It's all done with chemicals, friend, and your garments end up crisp and fresh. And here's the capper: no shrinkage.	Huh.
4 That's right! Dry cleaning--remember the name. It's going to revolutionize the laundry industry, and those that get in early are gonna bear the fruit away. All I need is $10,000 to open my first store, then I use its cash flow to finance another, and so on-- leap frog, bootstrap myself a whole chain. Well, me and a partner. Cleanliness, friend. There's money in it. There's a future. There's room to grow... Say, that's looking pretty good. Let's see it with the hairpiece on...

1 ...Yeah, that's it. As per our discussion.	Uh-huh.

1 Please, Ed.	But it's...
2 Please, Ed.

1 Come on, get ready. It's important.	Nah, go ahead. I'm not big on parties.
2 Oh, don't be a grump.

1 ...My books used to be perfect. Anyone could open them up, make sense of the whole goddamn store.	Honey...
2 I knew we'd pay for it.

1 Not guilty, your honor...	I tried to tell him the whole story, but Riedenschneider stopped me. He said the story made his head hurt, and anyway he didn't see any way of using it without putting me on the hot seat for the murder of Big Dave...

1 ...Huh?	Haven't I seen you up in ladies' wear?
2 I don't work here. My wife does.	Uh-huh. Some beat, huh?
3 Yeah.	Check out the rack on that broad in the angora.
4 Uh-huh.

1 ...How you today, Ed?	OK.
2 You don't got a headache?	...Nah.
3 Damn, I got a headache to beat the band.

1 ...I'm Crane.	My name is Diedrickson. County medical examiner.
2 Yeah?

1 What'd he say? Does he understand?	He said OK. Is that what he said?

1 I had no idea the Museum had a complete collection of Piranesi's Forum sketches.	If you like them, they're for sale. Another day like yesterday and half the collection will be on the block.
2 I've read about the Museum's financial troubles.	We've been operating in the red for years.  That was the whole idea behind the Superstition Exhibit.  It was designed to pull people in. We've spent every penny we have on advance publicity, betting everything on the opening's success. If we postpone at the last minute... No.  I don't want to think about that.

1 Ippolito!  Get back here!	Like hell!

1 You think what we've got here is a monster as big as a house that smells... like hamburger?	No.  I think what we've got here is a psychotic killer wielding some kind of unusual weapon... who wants us to believe he's a monster.
2 Oh.

1 Look.  It's some kind of letter.	May I see that?

1 What does it say?	Dr. John Whittlesley.
2 What's that doing here?	I don't know.  I thought Dr. Whittlesley died in South America.

1 I can't help thinking there's something that Pendergast overlooked.  If the scratches were made by whatever killed Beauregard, it wants something that's in here.	A blow dart.  Seed pods.  A plant press.  Pretty unimpressive stuff.
2 Let me see the plant press.

1 None of that matters now.  The people upstairs need us.  We have to help.	We can't.  We've managed to get inside the one place that's safe.  I think we should sit tight and wait for reinforcements.  If we go outside, we're risking more lives. You have to accept it, Margo, there's nothing we can do.  The building must be swarming with police by now.  It won't take long for them to get through the doors.
2 That thing could kill ten people in a matter of minutes.

1 We think it may have something to do with the eggs we found in the crate.	I don't believe it.

1 And it snuffled the ground like a dog.	Like this.

1 Jesus, what is this?	Another storage room.

1 These plant fibers are loaded with hormones!	What kind of hormones?

1 Where would we find it?	I'm not sure.  We should split up. You take that hall and I'll take this one.
2 All right.  I'm as macho as you are. Perhaps.

1 You'd slow us down and put Margo in danger.	Unlock one of the other storage rooms.  We're going upstairs.  We'll leave a trail back to 1012 and try to trap the monster in here.

1 We're not going to make the storage room!	Listen to me, Pendergast.  Mbwun's DNA is part homo sapien.  In primates, the eye is a direct path to the brain!  If you get a clean shot, there's only one place you can kill it.  Shoot it in the eye!

1 Give me a shot from Truman's ring.	He gave it back to his father.

1 Not only does he give us a glimpse of the truth, he gives us a glimpse of ourselves.	But how do you account for the popularity of those eight hours a day when Truman sleeps?
2 We find many viewers leave him on all night for comfort.  Haven't you ever watched your child or your lover sleep?	Let's go to some of those viewers' calls.

1 I have a map.	Truman, I've watched you your whole life. I saw you take your first step, your first word, your first kiss.  I know you better than you know yourself.  You're not going to walk out that door--
2 --You never had a camera in my head.

1 I'm thinking of getting out, Marlon.	Yeah?  Outta what?
2 Outta my job, outta Seahaven, off this island...<i>out!</i>

1 ...personally I think the unconquered south face is the only one worth scaling...of course it's a 20,000 foot sheer wall of ice but then when did that ever stop me before?...Naturally, I intend to make the ascent without the benefit of oxygen but also without crampons or even an ice pick...<i>risks?</i>...  ...sure I'm aware of the risks--why else do you think I would spend seven years as an adjuster in a life insurance company...?	Truman, you're gonna be late!

1 What did you want?	I made macaroni.
2 I'm not hungry.

1 It's hard to go places, isn't it?	There's been an accident, Truman.
2 Uhuh.  There's no accident.  It's just more stalling.

1 How are you, Mother?	Well, I made it through another night.
2 How's your hip?	Oh, just so.

1 Do you live around here?	Yeah.

1 Special Agent Scully --	I apologize for making you wait -- I've brought some new evidence with me --
2 Evidence of what?

1 Yes.	We have a situation. The members are assembling.
2 Is it an emergency?

1 You said you knew the location of the archeological site where these were found.	Show you right on a map.

1 See this bullshit...? Somebody knows I'm talking to you.	Not according to the men in blue.
2 What is it? Kiddie porn again? Sexual battery of a patient? I've had my license taken away in three states.	They want to discredit you -- for what?
3 For what? Because I'm a dangerous man. Because I know too much about the truth.	You mean that apocalyptic trash you write? I knew your name was familiar. I just didn't know why.
4 You know my work?	Dr. Kurtzweil, I'm not interested in bigoted ideas about race or genocide. I don't believe in the Elders of Zion, the Knights Templar, the Bilderburg Group or in a oneworld Jew run government --
5 I don't either, but it sure sells books.

1 Jesus, Mulder...	The element of surprise, Scully. Random acts of unpredictability. If we fail to anticipate the unforeseen or expect the unexpected in a universe of infinite possibilities, we find ourselves at the mercy of anyone or anything that cannot be programmed, categorized or easily referenced...

1 Scully?	Mulder. Move away from the door. We're coming through it.

1 You knew this man didn't die at the bomb site before we got here.	I'd been told as much.
2 You're saying the bombing was a cover-up. Of what?	I don't know. But I have a hunch what you're going to find here isn't anything that can be categorized or easily referenced.
3 Mulder, this is going to take some time, and somebody's going to figure out soon enough we're not even supposed to be here.  I'm in serious violation of medical ethics.	We're being blamed for these deaths. Scully, I want to know what this man died of. Don't you?

1 Hey, I was right about the bomb, wasn't I?	This is great. This is fitting.

1 I already gave Skinner my letter of resignation.	You can't quit, Scully.
2 I can, Mulder. I debated whether or not to even tell you in person, because I knew --	We're close to something here -- we're on the verge --
3 You're on the verge, Mulder -- please don't do this to me --	After what you saw last night -- after all you've seen -- you can't just walk away --
4 I have. I did. It's done.	Just like that --
5 I'm contacting the state board Monday to file medical reinstatement papers --	I need you on this, Scully --
6 You don't Mulder -- you've never needed me. I've only held you back.  I've got to go.

1 General McAddie is who requested our coming here. We were awakened at three AM and told to get down here immediately.	I don't know anything about that.
2 Well, call General McAddie.	I don't have his number.
3 They can patch you in through the switchboard.

1 I'm quite prepared to tell you everything, though there isn't much you haven't guessed.	About the conspiracy?
2 I think of it as an agreement. A word your father liked to use.	I want to know where Scully is.

1 My god...	The geometry of mass infection presents certain conceptual re-evaluations for us. About our place in their Colonization.
2 This isn't Colonization, it's spontaneous repopulation. All our work... if it's true, then they've been using us all along. We've been laboring under a lie!

1 Miriam...	Shush.

1 ...a pocketful of rye.	Four and twenty blackbirds...
2 Baked in a pie.

1 Agent Novak?	Peter, okay?
2 Do you feel there's a side of yourself you don't show people?

1 He wants us to follow.  The little boy...	Little boy?!  That's him!
2 He brought you to me, didn't he?  If you want Julia to live, trust me.  Trust him.

1 Thank you.	No problem.
2 No.  Thank you.

1 That's why we monitor the use of the drugs so closely.  We don't want her getting to that degree of perceptual disorientation.	Pump in two liters of pure oxygen, please Henry.

1 Nervous?	Absolutely.

1 How is she?	Pregnant.  Thanks for asking.

1 Ich weiss nicht.	Das mussen sie doch wissen. Ich meine ohne grund wird die politzei doch nicht ins Hans komme Fraulein Schmidt, ein schande...

1 Don't understand what Harry saw in a fellow like that.	That was the man that brought me some money when Harry died. He said Harry had been anxious at the last moment.

1 Harry?	Yes. He moved his head, but the rest is good, isn't it?

1 ...to steal my girl.	Where is she?

1 What happened to your hand?	A parrot...Let it go.
2 Have you seen Calloway?	Can you imagine a parrot nipping a man?
3 Have you?

1 Here, it will be cold on that train.	I shall be all right.
2 You send me a wire as soon as you arrive.

1 ...parents.	Yes.

1 Joseph Harbin's body was found in the coffin.	What did you say? I'm sorry...

1 We are interested in this case. Have you arrested the girl?	No, not yet.

1 Must have known I was broke. Even sent me an airplane ticket. It's a shame.	What?
2 Him dying like that.	Best thing that ever happened...

1 Miss Schmidt.	You're not locking her up?

1 ...be responsible for you in the streets.	I'm not asking you to.

1 Calloway, can't you do something about Anna?	I'll do what I can, if she'll let me.

1 ...excuse me.	Please hurry up - just get him on the telephone.
2 Do you know his number?	No, I don't know...

1 Seems exciting.	It is, and I'm gunning just the same way for your Major Callaghan.

1 Hello, Harry.	Well, well, they seem to've been giving you quite some busy time.
2 Listen...	Yes.
3 I want to talk to you.	Talk to me?...Of course...Come on...

1 Part? You can have any part you want, so long as you don't interfere...I have never cut you out of anything yet.	I remember when they raided the gambling joint - you know a safe way out...
2 Sure...

1 ...you.	Only his doctor, Dr. Winkel.

1 Find out?	Hear the details.
2 I can tell you very little. He was run over by a car. He was dead when I arrived.

1 Sehen sie da gleich da unter. Da unten ist est passiert. Passiert - English.	What's he saying?

1 Oh, you did.	Not the sort of thing I should confess to a total stranger, but you have to break the rules sometimes. Humanity's duty.

1 ...this time.	Yes.

1 You. You're the guy that lent me the money.	Yeah, that's right. Now could you be quiet so I can get some sleep.
2 Ten dollars. I'll find a way to pay you back. How would you like to know About somewhere special? The perfect beach. Paradise. No one else knows about it. That's got to be worth something. What do you say?	Look I don't care about the money right now: I just want some sleep. So if you could be quiet -
3 Yea, OK. I will be, I will be, I promise.	Thanks.

1 Everyone ok?	We're ok.
2 I think we're about half way.

1 Did you sleep well?	Not too bad.
2 I hope our noise did not keep you awake.

1 Do you know the Kentucky friend mouse story?"	Woman bites chicken leg, turns out to be a mouse. Or a rat. It's an urban myth.
2 Exactly. Always happened to someone else.	So?
3 So there's an urban myth, well more of a rural myth, going around here at the moment. It's about a beach.	Uh-huh.

1 Didn't you see <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i>?	What??
2 That was an ark, man. That was a Torah. They fucked around with it, and the Torah melted their faces.	That's a movie, you moron.
3 Fine, go ahead. Touch the letters.

1 How come you know all this shit?	How come you don't know it?  How can you say you hate the Jews when you don't know anything about --
2 Fuck you. I hate the Jews at least as much as you do.	No, you don't.... If you hated them, you'd study them, so you'd know why you hate them. You know what tefillin is? Tsitsis? Shotness? You know the kaddish from the kiddush?  Eichmann? He went to Israel. He studied the Torah, the Talmud, the Mishnah, the whole bit. He hated Jews.

1 You're not like the others, are you?... Your friends.	Yes, I am. Basically I am.

1 I want to learn to read it.	Why?
2 Know your enemy.... 'Cause it's a basic text of Western culture. I want to read it in the original. Okay?	Hebrew's very difficult. It would take years.
3 I'm good at languages.

1 You can't. Do you know how many people I've brought into...the movement...?	Lina, come here!

1 ...I thought we agreed, no anti- Semitism...it's exactly what we're trying to put behind us.... Trash the blacks, fine; but...	Did you see how they reacted to him?
2 Yes, of course. But that only plays in this room, with people who aren't embarrassed to call themselves Nazis. If you want a modern fascism, you don't mention Jews.	It's a romantic movement, Curtis. It always has been.
3 Lina, the Thousand-Year Reich barely lasted a decade.... Do you really want to go down that road again? In America of all places, where obedience and discipline are not exactly the national virtues...

1 What about...Manzetti, the synagogues....	That doesn't seem to be happening, does it?
2 I've been stuck out in the country with those guys who just want to paint swastikas and heil Hitler. How am I supposed to -- 

1 Why did you come tonight? To see me?	To hear them read Torah.
2 I thought you hated Torah.	That doesn't mean I don't like hearing it.
3 Point out all the lies and fucked-up thinking.

1 How have things been going?	Fine.
2 We want to talk to you about something....  We're about to launch an aboveground, intellectually serious fascist movement.

1 Where's Mrs. Moebius?	Her place is down the road. But she just comes out for weekends sometimes.

1 Oh, what is this shit?	Keep driving. Don't slow down.
2 Christ...

1 Lie on your stomach and come up on your elbows.	Why me?
2 You want to kill a Jew. I already did.

1 The Torah says not to light a fire on the Sabbath, because it's work, correct?  But if alternating current's running through the wires every second of every day, and I throw a switch, send it here instead of there, how is that lighting a fire?	"Do chickens give milk?"
2 Exactly.

1 Are you out of your mind?!	I was just trying to make a point. If --

1 And you...?  Do you love Enzo?	Very much, I think.  But, there's going to be a problem.

1 This is a great pleasure.	Johana Cross, pleased to meet you.  Well!  Isn't this a coincidence. I really wasn't expecting this... All the way out here.  It's incredible!

1 ... It's easy.  You go down.  You come up.  ... Right, Johana?	Congratulations, Enzo.
2 Don't you agree, Jacques?

1 Is he alright?  What happened?	The fool was asleep!  If I weren't around, he'd already be dead!!! Is that who you want to live with?

1 Where did you get that?	"That"!  This is not a "that"...

1 I remember.  Hi Roberto!	What room have you got?
2 I don't have one.	You don't have a room?  Paolo?  What did I just hear?  I personally called you to reserve a room for my good friend Jacques Mayol and you treat him like a stranger?!
3 It's okay, Enzo.  I'll go somewhere else.	Not only is Jacques Mayol a very special friend, but he happens to be one of the best divers in the world!  And you're throwing him out!  Are you crazy, or what? Stupido!
4 Enzo drop it, I'll find something.

1 No.	Then, it's very chic.  Avanti!

1 You still collect them?	Yes.
2 You don't have that one, do you?	No.  Thank you.  It's really beautiful.
3 Oh it's nothing.  I knew it.  I told Roberto "He's very good that little Frenchman, very good".  I lost my title but I won a watch!

1 You were right.	... I was right about what?
2 ... It is much better down there. It's a better place.

1 You're going to be very busy these days aren't you?	I don't know... why?
2 Just because... I would have liked to visit the town... See the coast... I don't know anybody... Expect for you.

1 Can I come watch you dive tomorrow?	Uh... Yes, of course!

1 Bonjour Monsieur... Louis. 	Uncle Louis.  He's a 75 year old amazing guy, isn't he?
2 I'm very pleased to meet you, Uncle Louis.

1 Mayol... Mayol... No reservation.	... Are you sure?
2 Positive, Sir.

1 What were Italians doing living in Greece anyway?	Louis, we were French!
2 That's different!  What's the matter with you?

1 ... And those?	Those are the divers who go down 300 to 330 feet.  They dive with a Helium-oxygen mixture.  At that depth, compressed air is too dangerous because it contains carbon dioxide.
2 What's that little air bottle on the machine?	That isn't for the divers actually. It's for the balloon.  It blows up and pulls the diver up like an elevator.  Without it, with the pressure at the bottom, the diver would just stay pinned to the sea bed.
3 But doesn't Jacques dive without anything?	Yes... It's magic.

1 Alright Mordechai, now that we're alone I just want to say that I'm not happy about this. I don't want a repeat of that incident in the West Bank.	I got the job done didn't I? I did what I had to do.
2 A settlement completely demolished, ten smashed army jeeps, four dead Arabs. G dash D damn it, Hammer! You think you're above the Ten Commandments? Just find Santa Claus and bring him back to us. No heroics, got it?	Hey, it's your Bar Mitzvah. I'm just readin' the Torah portion.

1 You like my Mordechai, yes?	He's...he's very nice.  But Mrs. Carver, the fate of Hanukkah rests solely in his hands. Please, you have to help me.

1 So, now what?	Now we wait for Santa to make his next move.

1 Oh my god. She's become my pimp. And she's whoring her bitch-son out to the highest bidder.	No. It's not like that. You're being completely neurotic. I was just playing along...

1 Let's let your tuchus breathe.	Mom, why don't you put that cat out of its misery?

1 So Morde-chai, tell me, what brings your bad self down to the KLF?	I'm back on the job for the JDL. You hear about that crazy white boy who took over as Santa?
2 Oh, most definitely. Got the brothers here in full alert mode.

1 How do we bypass it?	The alarm will trigger if the system detects any Non-W.A.S.P. tendencies inside the building. For example, if you were to dribble a basketball, or eat watermelon, or use the word dawg...that is, spelled with an aw as opposed to the letter o...within the confines of this workshop, the alarm would sound.

1 I shlepped all the way to the North Pole for this? I come to fight you, and you don't even put out anything to nosh on? What kind of arch nemesis are you?	Hah! Jewish guilt. Well, it won't work on me Hammer. I'm too strong for it.

1 Well, he's kinda just resting in the corner with his girlfriend.	Resting?

1 This is for "mama and the kids."	What about me?
2 You get your money from your husband.

1 Charlie wasn't drunk last night.	Yes, I was drunk, Mr. Manning.

1 Cut.	What are you doing that for?

1 And if you've got cold feet honey, Ill take over for you. That red dress of yours fits just perfect on me.	I bet you try on my coffin some day -- I hope it "fits just perfect."

1 Come to look around?	More or less.
2 I'll take you about. Got some nice things.

1 It was you, Galbraith!	No.
2 It was you.	Not! I tell you. No!
3 You shot the leopard. We know that. You killed Consuelo. You killed Clo Clo. Then tonight --	I didn't do anything. She screamed. Something frightened her.
4 Consuelo screamed too -- and Clo Clo. Why did you do it? Why? Quick. Tell me why?	It's better you don't know.
5 Tell me.	Why do yo&amp;i accuse me? You don't know what you're doing -- you don't understand -- nobody understands --

1 You can go now, Manning. There is no way we can hold you legally responsible.	Thanks, Sheriff.

1 You won't go to Galbraith with me?	Offend a reputable citizen and involve the department in a slander suit? No. I'm in office to protect the taxpayers money  not throw it way. Come on, Charlie.

1  As long as my feet held out.	And not a sign of the leopard?

1 Kiki -- it wasn't the leopard.	You're positive of that, aren't you?
2 Absolutely sure.

1 Good afternoon. De Moraess residence.	Could I speak to Carlos or Deborah?
2 Im afraid they are out at the moment, sir.	When will they be back?
3 Mr De Moraes is due back from Brazil late this evening. Mrs De Moraes is out and not expected before eight. Do you wish...

1 How dare you...  You dont know this tape belongs to my brother, do you, Mr Lombard?	The question now is whether or not your brother still owns anything, Mrs De Moraes.
2 No. The question now is how long its going to take you to get out of here, Mr Lombard.	Excuse me?
3 Get out of my house. Youre fired, Mr Lombard.	Perhaps I should come back when youre...
4 No. Youre fired! Get out of my house. And take your sick tape with you...

1 Are you all right?	Yes... You woke me up... Its the middle of the night here. Have you found Mr Friedman?
2 Not yet. The place I hoped to find him turns out to be little more than a contact address. Ill give it 24 hours. He just might show up.  If you need to reach me ask for Mr Lamont. Paul Lamont, all right?	Paul Lamont...?
3 Yeah. Goodnight, Mrs De Moraes.

1 What do you mean, No, Mrs De Moraes?	My brother hung himself.
2 Does the name Pierre Dreyer mean anything to you? Hes a client of mine and a friend of your husband.	Leon hung himself.
3 Adonis thought your brothers bodyd be found reasonably quickly when he hung it in Epping Forest, didnt he? Seemed like a good idea. An ex-junkie, obsessed with death; the perfect candidate for suicide. He just forgot one thing: forest ramblers are rare during your average blustery English November. An Englishman might have thought of that, but a Brazilian...	Leon hung himself...
4 Leons not found, your parents worry, talk of hiring help to find him, even mention their manhunter friends perhaps... and Adonis panics, takes control, brings me in reckoning a small- time detective is unlikely to dig up anything awkward, not before Leons found anyhow. He must have kicked himself when he learned Id exceeded his expectations.	Leon hung himself...
5 Leon didnt hang himself, Deborah. Your husband killed him and made his death look like suicide. How did he do it, eh? Strangulation? Drugs? No doubt an autopsy will tell.

1 I... We have to bury Leon tommorrow...	The dead can wait.

1 Okay. The woman just cant walk away...  I want straight answers. No hesitation or I walk for sure. Why cant you go to your Embassy?	French people need a visa to enter this country. That takes time and I didnt have any. I used a British passport. My names not Lamont but Lombard. Xavier Lombard.

1 A little too tight, eh?  ...They were my sons. Only thirteen and already six feet tall. A real lanky boy...  I... Theres some cold chicken salad in the fridge if youre hungry.	Thank you. But I think Ill go to bed. Its been a long day.
2 Right... Well, Ill get your money first thing in the morning, okay?  Okay. Goodnight then.	Yeah. Goodnight, Emily.
3 Dont fall asleep with your hair wet.

1 Theyd never let me go. And youd end up in more trouble than you know for helping me.	You cannot walk away from this. You cannot.
2 I can... The question is, can you lie to your ex- husband?

1 Where is the Austrian?	You... Fuck you!

1 Hello again, neighbour. I didnt intrude, did I?	How are you, Jane?
2 Fine. How was the match? Did you loose?	No.
3 Must be your lucky day then. Ive got your accounts - you dont owe much tax for last year.	Good.
4 Yes. But my boss reckons youd still be better off as a limited company. For expenses and all that, you know? Itd cost you about 100 but he said itd be worth it.  Of course, youd need a partner to register. But thats a formality. I mean, I could be your partner. I mean, just as a name, right?

1 Lombard, this is not a Jewish name, is it?	I hope its not too significant.
2 What if it is?	Well, I would have to point out that we could have dealt with that question when you called this morning, Mrs Spitz. I wouldnt like to think Id kept you waiting for nothing.

1 The rooms yours for 24 hours. Its sound- proofed, stocked up with food, drink and other things you might find useful. You can do anything you like.	Anything at all?
2 Anything at all. I presume you wont want to take the boy with you when youre finished?  Theres a 500 fee for disposal. The boy is yours, you understand?

1 You know what, Martin? I ought to tie you down with your old arse up in the air and advertise the hole in the middle of it to the world. Free. And hope you never die.	Huh... Im sure thered be lots of takers.
2 Could someone have hurt you that bad?

1 Evening. Table for one?	No. Thank you. Could you tell me if Leon Spitz is here, please?
2 Leon? No. Im afraid he left.	Left? When? I just come from his place and there was no one there. A neighbour of his...
3 No. I meant he left as in no longer works here.	Oh. This is... Wed arranged to meet tonight and Im due to return to Paris tomorrow...
4 Im sorry...	Yes. You wouldnt know where I could reach him? We had to discuss an exhibition of his photographs at my Paris gallery, you see? I really need to see him before I leave.

1 The money Leon left for the boy, was it cash?	Yes. Three thousand pounds. I still...
2 Did he mention anything about having an exhibition of his work?	... No.
3 You sure? What about before he turned up with the boy?	... No. In fact, Id seen him a couple of months earlier. He was quite depressed. His work wasnt getting anywhere. He said he was going to try something new, realism, London in the nineties - documentary stuff, you know...

1 Bye. And thanks... Nathalie gently closes the door, eyes Lombard who shakes himself awake... rolls her eyes and surveys the room...	O est pass ton salon?
2 Mon bureau cotait trop cher.	Eh bien... Tes sr que tas besoin de moi?  La petite ma lair assez bien foutue, non?

1 Moreau? Cest moi. Alors...	Salut, Laurent. Ouais. It wasnt easy but I got what you wanted through Interpol. Say, whats your business with these Spitzes?
2 They lost their son. Why?	It appears that in their younger days they were actively involved with a shady German group of Nazi hunters known as Never Forget. Over the years were talking about a dozen or so execution-type killings.
3 Are they still operative?	Their last suspected kill occurred two years back, though your Spitzes now probably do no more than bankroll the group. Still, Id watch my step. These people are well-connected, Laurent; former Israeli prime minister, etc. The ladys also president of an international Zionist organisation... Anyway, you get the picture.
4 Mossad?	Its a good guess...

1 What do you fear most now... my sword?  ... or his hands?	Tremoille... don't.  Please...

1 What's going on?!	They've started the battle without me!

1 If you really want to help me, there's one thing you can do.	Tell me...
2 Tell the king to give me more men.

1 ... and maybe the king will give you some money, and a little land, and a title even...  ... wouldn't that be a fine thing? You, a lady of title!	I'm staying, Jean.
2 No, you must come, Jeanne -- we need you -- so much has happened since you left... I have a new horse now, a white one, just like yours... and La Hire hardly swears at all anymore...  You can't stay -- they'll burn you!	I'm not afraid of the fire anymore. It will purify me...
3 Jeanne, you can't leave us like this!

1 W-w-what are you doing?!	Performing a miracle.

1 Are you alright?  Did they hurt you?	No no, I'm fine, really...
2 I was so worried -- we've all been looking for you!  The English are everywhere!  O thank you, lord!

1 Jeanne -- be careful -- you're not helping yourself by refusing to submit to our judgment...	And you be careful, you who claim to be my judges, for you too will be judged one day...!

1 I don't understand, Jeanne... why did you do it?  Why?	And you?  Why did you lie?  You promised I could be confessed...
2 I know, Jeanne... it was the only way to save you from the fire!	It's not my body I want to save. It's my soul.

1 ... and what... what did he say?	He said that I have to save France from her enemies and give her back to God, and He told me that I -- Jeanne -- will lead you to the altar at Rheims to be crowned King of France.

1 I... I don't know... it'll sound like we... betrayed her...?	Noooo!

1 "Be patient, be patient"... is that the only advice you can ever come up with??  I've shown more patience than a dozen saints!	Jeanne, you have to understand -- it's not easy for us -- I mean for our pride -- to suddenly be usurped by a -- well, with all due respect, by a... girl.
2 Ah, so that's it.  To you I'm just a girl.	Jeanne, put yourself in my shoes for a moment -- how would you feel, if you were me?
3 Knowing what I know?  Enormous gratitude.

1 God... why of course -- we'd forgotten about him!  Strange, I don't seem to remember seeing him at Agincourt.	Damn right!
2 Oh, but I forgot!  It was a Sunday... that explains it.  God's day off.

1 Jeanne... The men are exhausted!	I know, but so is the enemy -- they're falling back -- Paris is ours...!
2 Jeanne... we're not enough...	So... bring up the reinforcements!
3 Reinforcements?  Where??

1 Jesus Christ... the goddamn English will pay for this!	They will -- and so will you if you go on swearing like that.

1 You don't believe me anymore?	We still believe in you, Jeanne.  If it were up to me, I'd chase every goddamn Englishman into the ocean. But it's not up to us anymore -- it's up to the king...

1 Why were you yelling like that?!	What are you doing here?  Please... leave... you can't stay here...
2 Why?  Are you waiting for someone else?	Yes!
3 Who?

1 My voices... my voices... do you think they will ever come back?	I don't think so.
2 Are you going to leave me too?	Yes... of course... when you don't need me anymore.
3 Are you sent by God?

1 Beautiful.	And what does he say to you?

1 Hello.	I came specially to meet you today. I love your playing, but what a day to choose.
2 Who are you?	My name's Dorota, I'm Jurek's sister. oh! You're bleeding.
3 It's nothing.

1 When's your baby due?	Christmas.  This is not a good time to have children. But then...

1 Have you seen this?	What, I'm working, what?

1 They bombed us, we're off the air.	Warsaw's not the only radio station.

1 What are you reading?	'If you prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you poison us, do we not die? And if you wrong us, shall we not revenge?'

1 Puppydog, what d'you mean, you forgot?	What d'you think I mean, Kitten? I forgot, that's what I mean.
2 You know what? You treat me like dirt!	I treat you like dirt because you are dirt.
3 Pig!	Cow!
4 Pig!	Bitch!
5 Dirty pig!	You're a dirty pig!
6 Takes one to know one! Pig!

1 I'm sorry, I did my best, I thought the certificates would save us all.	Stop it, Wladek.

1 What about you?	I've got another one.  Warmer.  What will you do when it's all over?
2 I'll play the piano again. On Polish radio.	Tell me your name. I'll listen out for you.
3 Szpilman.	Szpilman.  Good name for a pianist.

1 And with time she will, I'm sure, become affectionate.	Certainly, there is nothing so easy to like as a pet and they are quite silent.

1 Go Peini ... Haere atu e Peini.	I'll be back.

1 I'll have to come and hear you play. what do you play.	Nothing just yet

1 What did she say?	She says, throw the piano overboard.
2 It's quite safe, they are managing...

1 And when is the next lesson?	Tomorrow.

1 Yeh, go ahead.	At the finish, it's Single Action by two, Fasanella second, Visitation third.  Line on Single Action... 3 to 2. Hell with it, that's no good.

1 You're late.  Where you been?	I had some appointments.
2 How much did ya lose?	All of it.
3 In one goddamn night?  What are ya sprayin' money around like that for? You coulda been nailed.	I checked the place out.  There weren't no dicks in there.
4 You're a con man, and you blew it like a pimp.  I didn't teach ya to be no pimp.	What's eatin' you?  I've blown money before.
5 No class grifter woulda' done it, that's all.	You think my play is bad?
6 I think it's the best...

1 How do you like that Coleman, huh? After three years.	Aw come on, it was the only thing to do.  He knew he was holdin' ya back.
2 We were partners.  If it weren't for Luther I'd still be hustlin' pinball down at Gianelli's.  I don't need anything more than I got.	You ain't gonna have nothin' if you don't lay off them games of chance. There's a depression on ya know.
3 There's always a depression on.	If you saved a little, you wouldn't have to grift so much.
4 I like griftin'.	You could buy yourself some things. Clothes, or a nice car...
5 I don't look any good in clothes and I don't know how to drive. What else ya got to sell, Eirie?	Forget it.

1 Been a while since I stocked a wire store.  Not many mobs playing that anymore.	All we need is the bookie setup for now.  We'll worry about the telegraph office later.
2 All right, I'll rent ya everything I got in the warehouse for two grand.  That'll give ya phones, cages, blackboards and ticker gear. You supply the guys to move 'em. If you want a counter and bar, that's another grand.  I don't know where the hell I'm gonna get 'em though.	C'mon, you can do better than that. We ain't no heel grifters.
3 You want the stuff tomorrow or don't ya?  It's gonna take hours just to clean it up.  Besides, Gondorff's still a hot item.  Where am I gonna be if he gets hit?	Just give us what ya can, Benny. We'll send a truck down.

1 He's waitin' for you in the card room.	Let him wait.

1 You know how easy it'd be for one of Lonnegan's guys to nail you?	All we need is a couple days, Henry. A couple days and we'll get Lonnegan down and stomp on 'em.
2 You just won't learn, will ya. Hell, you come in here, I teach you stuff maybe five guys in this world know, stuff most grifters couldn't do even if they knew it, and all you wanna do is run down a bullet.  You're just like all them new jerks. Lotsa nerve and no brains.  And ten years from now when me and the others are through and you dumb guys are all dead there won't be one gee left who knows the Big Con was anything more than a way to make a livin'.	A couple days; that's all I'm askin'.  I can stay clear that long.
3 Christ, they'll probably miss you and hit me.

1 Looks like he's sulking.	If we're lucky, this'll bring him back stronger than ever.

1 Raise 1,000.	Raise 500.

1 Excuse me, sir.  Treasury Dept... I'd like to ask you a few questions.	What for?  I haven't done anything.
2 We don't doubt that, but there's a counterfeiting operation passing bad money in the station.  Have you made any purchases here today?	Yes, a ticket to Chicago.

1 I don't even know you.	You know me.  I'm just like you... It's two in the morning and I don't know nobody.

1 What's the matter?  You gotta get back to Shaw?	Naw, he picked up some jane in the bar.  Can't see him till morning anyway.
2 All right, then.

1 What happened to your face?	Had a little fight with a raggle down on 13th.  She got me with her ring.

1 Yeh, and what if we play tomorrow and he doesn't come up with the money.  We risk our whole operation for nothing.  I'll say when we make our bets.	Not if you want me to keep makin' 'em for ya.

1 There's a physiological as well as a psychological angle in my father's relationship with Julia Wolf that the police have overlooked.  And I think it explains everything.  You see, my father was a sexogenarian.	He was?
2 Yes.  He admitted it.	Sexogerarian, eh?  Yes.  Yes.  But I can't put that in the paper.
3 Why not?	You know how they are... sex...
4 Then just say he was sixty years old.	Is that what it means?
5 Of course.

1 What?	Nothing.
2 You better take a drink.

1 That isn't true.  It was about your father.  Where is he?	He's all right.  Isn't that enough?
2 No.	You just want money -- and you haven't any right to any more.  He made a big settlement on you.
3 That's gone long ago.  I've got to see him.  Where is he?	I won't have you hounding him any more for money.

1 You know, we know each other.	Of course we do! We've been friends for years.
2 Aren't you Nick Charles?	Yes.
3 You don't remember me.....  I'm Dorothy Wynant.

1 Hello, Dorothy. 	Hello, Nick!  And a party - celebrating father's third murder - 

1 You can take that out to the car.	Going to run him through the fluoroscope?
2 Yes.	Do you mind if I come down and see it?
3 Not at all.	I'm very interested in that body.

1 Have you got a pistol permit?	No.
2 Ever heard of the Sullivan Act?

1 Get anything?	She's ready to talk.  It won't do any harm, though - to find out where he is.

1 I know he'll turn up as soon as he sees this in the papers.  You can't think he had anything to do with it, Mr. Guild.  He wasn't the kind of man that....	Do you know what they fought about that night he went away?
2 I didn't know they had a fight.	Well, thanks.  We'll call you when we need you again.

1 Mr. Guild means guests!  Oh, there are two more to come.	They'll be here.  Don't worry.  My men are picking them up.
2 You're a great help to a hostess. I wish I always had you for my dinner parties.

1 We're just having a little drink.	So I see.

1 One hundred...  two hundred... three...	Never mind.
2 I wish you'd count them.  There's a thousand dollars there.	I trust you.
3 Isn't there anything else I can do for you? Have you bought your ticket?	No.
4 Well, let me do that for you.	You might do that.  Get me a ticket for...  No, you don't!

1 But it must have been Wynant.  I should have known if it weren't his voice.	Oh he as clever about that.  He called when you were out.  That same afternoon, Julia telephoned to him. She said that you were coming, Mimi, to ask about Wynant. He got terrified. He was afraid that Julia would break down and tell... so he went to Julia and killed her and left Wynant's watch chain in her hand.

1 You did... where?	Last night.  He came to see me at my apartment.
2 Oh, did he?  What did he say?	He didn't say very much.  Wanted to know how I was and how the children were.

1 You might have mentioned me first.	He's well-trained.  He'll behave himself.
2 As long as there isn't a fire hydrant.  What I've gone through --

1 She didn't tell me a thing.	Too bad you didn't bring your whip.

1 I wish that doctor'd come.  How do you feel?	He'll be here.  Give him time to get his trousers on.  Where's Asta?  Asta!  Asta!

1 What's the trouble, Asta?  Your balloon busted?  So's mine.	What's the matter with you?
2 The mystery's all gone. And I wanted you to find out who did it.	Maybe I will.
3 But Wynant --- ?	I don't believe he did it.
4 Why don't you?	No reason.  Just a hunch.  But I'm going to find out.  I'm tired of being pushed around.
5 So am I.	Come on, Watson, we're going places.

1 Serve the nuts - I mean, serve the guests the nuts.	I'm afraid you're lying, Mimi. You see, I really did see Wynant last night.

1 I'm sorry...  but...	Two weeks work gone for nothing.
2 I just wanted to tell you...	I don't care what you wanted to tell me.  You're through!  Get your things and get out!

1 It's a map, I think that's what it is.	There you go, Jaeger.  Just find the buried treasure, and you're a millionaire.

1 You two fighting's not going to get us anything.	Him getting us stranded out here doesn't do much good either.

1 Not much of a pass.	Probably was a couple of hundred years ago when whoever drew the map came through here.  Worn down to nothing now.
2 Picks up again just on the other side.

1 You ready?	All right.  I'll go up, then you send up the gold and--

1 I don't care what he says, he wanted our gold.  Would have slit our throats if he had the chance.	Doesn't matter.  Whatever he wanted he didn't get it.  We've got no need staying around here.  It's light enough.  Let's pack up and head out.

1 Wes, we thought you were dead, and we thought we were next.  Hanging around to get killed wouldn't have done anyone any good.	Sure, and I guess it was just convenient there was one less person to split the gold with.
2 Wes--	Look, I know you guys are telling the truth.  It's just the Shi'ites don't know that.  I guess you could tell them...but then you don't speak the language do you?

1 Don't worry about Jaeger.  He uses his personality as a form of birth control.	Blow me.  Have I said that to you guys recently?  Blow me.

1 It's war.  People get lost all the time in war, cut off--	We disappear for awhile.  We disappear, we came back; nobody knows nothing.
2 But we all got to be in for this.  We all go, or we do nothing.

1 Figure they don't want to mess with us anymore than we want to mess with them.	Look at you, not even breaking a sweat. You're cool, boy.  You're cool.

1 What!?	Mine.

1 When we start running suck up your breath.  You're going to get the wind knocked out of you.	Don't let me die, Epps.  I don't want to die.

1 Not enough.  We're out numbered and out gunned.  They'd cut us to shreds.	So good bye, Shi'ites.  Thanks for playing.  We have some lovely parting gifts for you as you go.

1 It's just a mongoose.	Is it dead?
2 Yeah, Bwana, you got it.

1 We got to go back.  We got to go back for Wes.	Forget Wes.
2 We can't just leave him.	Wes is dead!
3 What if he's not?	Then he will be when those Iraqis get to him.  He was going to kill you.  He was one blink away from it.  He's dead, Epps, and I'm sure as hell not getting my head blow off over his carcass.

1 We can't just sit here.  We've got to start moving, so pick.	You sure you want me too?

1 Slip out your M-16.	And then what?
2 And then shoot them.	I...I never killed anyone before.  I told you that.
3 Well, you're going to start with a bang, 'cause you've got four of them to take down.

1 Can you ride a horse?	No, but I figure now's a real good time to start.

1 Woods.	Hey, Jaeger.  What's up.
2 I'm looking for a favor.  I need a map of Iraqi.	A map?  All I got is maps.  I'm gonna have Delayed Map Syndrome when I finally get out of here.  What kind of map you need?  Topographical, geographical, thermal?

1 What is this?	Now you need me.
2 What is it?  You know so much about Arabland tell me what it is.

1 We...we could go home with something else.	What?
2 With...with millions.  Millions of dollars.

1 Yeah!  Yeah!	I think I'm going to throw up.  I am. I'm going to toss.
2 You see that?  Right by us.  They went right by.  You had them Epps; you called it.

1 Jesus!  What the hell did he do that for? They're Iraqis.  Why are Iraqis killing Iraqis?	Those people down there are Shi'ites. You've got Shi'ites in the south of Iraq and Khurds in the North.  Neither of them've got much love for Saddam. Probably figured once the war started there might be an uprising, so he sent his soldiers out to slap them around some.

1 With what?  He doesn't have a weapon.	He's a soldier.  He doesn't need a weapon.  He's got rocks.  He's got bare hands.

1 A sinex drop reading of less then 2000 degrees with an accompanying loss of greater then 350 degrees since admission may indicate....?	Permant cortex bond.
2 Correct.

1 Then why did you bring it up?	I didn't.  You asked me about the card.  You're going to get us into trouble.

1 I can't go on like this.  I can't....  I don't just sit around and watch people.  If I make a mistake, it's all over.  You see it every day.  Do you want to see me taken away in pieces?	I don't want to lose you.

1 You always manage to avoid the issue:  What's wrong with our present condition?  We're COMFORTABLE and we have plenty of food...I feel absolutely no threat because there is no threat. Why incite trouble?  You should examine your emotions.  It is senseless...	What are you talking about? When did you sleep last?  Do you know what your trouble is? You're blind.  You've been here so long you can't see what is happening.  We must unite.  We need unity.  We need action. ) We have come to a time when we must....

1 We must escape.  We have plans. We can leave.  We must wait until...	Incredible!

1 I'm leaving.	What?

1 This one has eyes.  Why did they leave your eyes? Could you ever....	No!....

1 Yes.	My mate has been acting very strange.  I can't explain it.....but.  I haven't been feeling very well myself.  I don't know, maybe it's me.  I needed an SP9 last night.  I feel as if something odd were happening to me. Something....
2 Yes.	I can't understand.  The sedatives....

1 Where did you get this?	Off a girl's wrist. A suspect...

1 Nice performance back there. Where'd you learn that, Mike Ditka Sensitivity Seminar?	Hey, look--
2 No you look, mister! First, you don't go calling my men names. It's bad for morale. Second, us "punks" happen to know a heck of alot more about police work than any vice cop ever did.	Oh yeah? Prove it.
3 Drive.

1 How long were you hooked?	What?
2 You don't have to talk about it.

1 Good, now the other side.	Nothing.
2 Okay, let's go in.

1 You got it.	We work fast enough for you?

1 Relax, Pooch, it's just a ticker, it's not personal.	Let's face it, we all knew it would happen sooner or later. The guy who can build a mousetrap that's better than we are ...

1 What's the matter?	Nothing... just tired.

1 You were lucky today, vice boy. Captain said to leave it alone, but just remember, I'm watching you.	I'm sorry, detective, but you're just not my type.

1 That guy's wife must be pretty pissed off to play a trick like that.	No shit. I better send Meg flowers just in case.

1 Why don't you just shoot it and put it out of its misery?	What are you talking about, it's purring like a kitty.
2 I thought you said what's-her-name's brother was going to fix it.	She didn't work out, had to cut her loose.
3 What was it this time?	She wanted to cook me breakfast.

1 A what?	IRA - instant retirement account.

1 Sir...	I thought I told you--

1 on staircase; from Gaston's point of view. He stops.	Yes, M'sieu Laval?
2 Madame has changed her mind. She'll be down in a minute.

1 The representative of the police wants to know if there is anything wrong with your tonsils.	No!
2 <u>Niente!</u>	That's just what I tried to tell him. Well, one word led to another. He really was a very charming fellow. So we talked for about ten minutes.

1 It must be the most marvelous supper. We may not eat it, but it must be marvelous.	Yes, Baron.
2 And, waiter--you see that moon?	Yes, Baron.
3 I want to see that moon in the champagne.	Yes, Baron.  Moon in champagne.
4 I want to see-- 	Yes, Baron.
5 And as for you, waiter--	Yes, Baron?
6 I don't want to see you at all!	No, Baron!  I beg your pardon.
7 Thank you.

1 Do you <u>know</u> King Boris?	No--no.
2 Do you know the Marquis de la Tours?	I would like to.
3 You'd better not. He's really very dull. But anyhow, when the king tells the marquis he saw me, the marquis will tell the marchesa. And the marchesa is the best friend of the Duchess of Chambro. And <u>she</u> will phone the Princess de Costa. The princess doesn't like me--but I don't care!	Why should you?
4 But she talks a lot. And before this night is over, all Venice will know it. And tomorrow it will be Grand Canal gossip! ... Oh!

1 You! And she's willing to pay as high as fifty francs!	What?
2 But it's not enough!

1 One purse--  empty. One vanity case-- 	But really, m'sieu, this isn't necessary.
2 Please, Madame Colet, I believe in doing things correctly. Shall we continue?  Two hairpins, one cigarette lighter, one box of real matches, and-- Oh, yes, this letter from Major--	Oh! You didn't read it!
3 Naturally I did.	Oh!
4 You needn't be embarrassed, madame. A lady as charming as you would, and <u>should</u>, get love letters.	M'sieu Laval!
5 But one suggestion, madame.  Not the major.  I don't  mind his grammatical mistakes. I'll overlook his bad punctuation. But the letter has no mystery--no bouquet--no ...  And one lipstick ...  Scarlet number four.	What's wrong now?
6 With your skin, I prefer crimson.	Too much blue in crimson.
7 That's what you need!	No, no, no!  I disagree with you completely! I tried it once--
8 What shade of powder do you use?	Peaches and cream.
9 That's too dark.	Do you realize I have light eyes?
10 But, Madame Colet, that's a matter of eye shadow. I can straighten that out in two seconds.

1 But you have an engagement, and I don't want people to talk.	Talk? About me--about us?
2 Precisely.	Afraid I'm ruining your reputation, M'sieu Laval?
3 No--yours, madame.	M'sieu Laval, I've got a confession to make to you ...

1 Goodbye...	Goodbye.
2 It could have been marvelous ...	Divine ...
3 Wonderful ... But tomorrow morning, if you should wake out of your dreams and hear a knock, and the door opens, and there, instead of a maid with a breakfast tray, stands a policeman with a warrant--then you'll be glad you're alone.	But it could have been glorious.
4 Lovely.	Divine ... But that terrible policeman!
5 Goodbye ... 

1 Well, in times like these most people are cutting salaries, but suppose we say, in your case, three hundred and fifty?	Oh, madame, you're just too sweet for words! 

1 Mr. Andrews, thank God! Where would the Master at Arms take someone under arrest?!	What? You have to get to a boat right away!
2 No! I'll do this with or without your help, sir. But without will take longer.	Take the elevator to the very bottom, go left, down the crewman's passage, then make a right.
3 Bottom, left, right. I have it.	Hurry, Rose.

1 Hey, Lizzy. I need to talk to you for a second.	Don't you mean work me?
2 Look, I'm running out of time. I need your help.	I'm not going to help you browbeat my hundred and one year old grandmother. I came down here to tell you to back off.
3 Lizzy... you gotta understand something. I've bet it all to find the Heart of the Ocean. I've got all my dough tied up in this thing. My wife even divorced me over this hunt. I need what's locked inside your grandma's memory.  You see this? Right here?

1 What could possible be funny?	I put the diamond in my coat pocket. And I put my coat... on her.

1 My God... Cal. Is it a --	Diamond. Yes it is. 56 carats.

1 I know.  Perhaps you could join us for dinner tomorrow, to regale our group with your heroic tale?	Sure. Count me in.
2 Good. Settled then.

1 How you two doin'?	I don't know what she's say, she don't know what I say, so we get along fine.

1 Why have we stopped?	We've struck ice.
2 Well, do you think the ship is seriously damaged?	Excuse me.

1 Mr. Dawson, I --	Jack.
2 Jack... I feel like such an idiot. It took me all morning to get up the nerve to face you.	Well, here you are.
3 Here I am. I... I want to thank you for what you did. Not just for... for pulling me back. But for your discretion.	You're welcome. Rose.
4 Look, I know what you must be thinking! Poor little rich girl. What does she know about misery?	That's not what I was thinking. What I was thinking was... what could have happened to hurt this girl so much she though she had no way out.
5 I don't... it wasn't just one thing. It was everything. It was them, it was their whole world. And I was trapped in it, like an insect in amber.  I just had to get away... just run and run and run... and then I was at the back rail and there was no more ship... even the Titanic wasn't big enough. Not enough to get away from them. And before I'd really though about it, I was over the rail. I was so furious. I'll show them. They'll be sorry!	Uh huh. They'll be sorry. 'Course you'll be dead.
6 Oh God, I am such an utter fool.	That penguin last night, is he one of them?
7 Penguin? Oh, Cal! He is them.	Is he your boyfriend?
8 Worse I'm afraid.

1 I saw that in a nickelodeon once, and I always wanted to do it.	Cal, surely you remember Mr. Dawson.

1 What is it? A sapphire?	A diamond. A very rare diamond, called the Heart of the Ocean.

1 Don't you believe it, Rose. Don't!	He couldn't have.

1 You must do me this honor... promise me you will survive... that you will never give up... no matter what happens... no matter how hopeless... promise me now, and never let go of that promise.	I promise.
2 Never let go.	I promise. I will never let go, Jack. I'll never let go.

1 It's been 84 years...	Just tell us what you can --
2 It's been 84 years... and I can still smell the fresh paint. The china had never been used. The sheets had never been slept in.

1 Anya!	Don't you hate people that surprise you? ... I do.  We can't stand here.

1 Feeling a little better, I see.	Yes, yes--the air--  --I'm getting plenty of air.  Miss Marsh--Mrs. Rosson.

1 --that's what we call double-a grade lumber, ma'am; You don't find a knot in a thousand feet.	Isn't that interesting?

1 Aces full.	And me coming in with two pair-- 

1 Where have you been hiding?	Oh--hello!  I got the flowers. That was sweet of you--thank you.
2 Don't thank me. Do you recognize me without the lipstick?	So you washed it off!
3 How about giving me another coat?	Good-by.
4 Wait a minute!--They're dancing in the palm court--	Good-by!
5 There's soft music--	--sorry--got an appointment to play shuffle-board.
6 Have we?--Well, I'd just as soon play shuffle-board.

1 What are you thinking?	A lot of things I'd like to forget.
2 That's funny--so was I.  Guess the ocean makes one sentimental	I can't blame the ocean--it's you.
3 You don't know anything about me. If you did, you probably wouldn't be here.

1 Well, I'll be--!!!	What's the matter?

1 Just a minute, steward--haven't you forgotten something?	No, sir?
2 My change.	Change?
3 A dollar forty--out of the two dollars I gave you.

1 Say--wait a minute!	See you later, Shortie--I'm off to the pool.

1 I'm going to the show--	I'll go with you--

1 Thought you might need me--don't talk, kid, and don't let him scare you-- 	Don't be too smart, Jimmy--you're out in the rough yourself. You had an argument with Lother a couple of hours before he was killed--but I'll deal with that later--

1 I won't--I'll ask for one right now.  Sally tells me she's in love with you.	She did?
2 Yes--but don't ask me why--because I could never tell you. I don't know what most guys want out of life--but <U>that</U> would be enough for me--I wouldn't care about-- easy money--or--showing off my smart brains--I'd just like to live <U>my</U> life so nothing I did would bounce back and ruin <U>hers</U>--Do I make myself clear?	Very clear. That's one favor I'll be glad to do you.
3 O.K., kid--  I'm only sorry for one thing.	What's that?
4 If you hadn't agreed--I was going to throw you overboard-- 

1 I can see where I won't talk much to you.	<U>Nuts</U> to you too!

1 Those kids seem to be getting along fine!--	It must be the sea air--it gets everybody.
2 He's a likable chap--he's got an honest face--	It's all right--if you like honest faces--let's have another drink--Steward!
3 Oh no--I don't want to impose on you--  It's funny about that billfold--I could have sworn I had it- 

1 I'll give you another chance to tell the truth, Lother.	What do you mean?
2 Why don't you be a good little boy and leave her alone?	Oh--I understand you were an important part of her education when she came to New York.
3 I just tried to show her the difference between the squirrels and the skunks.	Meaning what?
4 You don't shoot squirrels.

1 You're wasting your time--she's a friend of mine.	Eh?... Oh.
2 He works the boats as a "come-on" man. We ought to make a fair combination and do a little business. Jack's a pretty good dealer himself.	There's a lot of trout in this stream just waitin' for a fly.  I've already been workin' on a young fellow from Chicago--related to one of the big packin' families--on his way to Biarritz for a good time. Likes a little game of bridge and poker.

1 Go ahead--you didn't used to be so fussy--	I've lost my taste for knickknacks--
2 Don't be a mug all your life--I'm trying to help you-- you need me more than I need you--have you figured they might pick the kid up in France and extradite him?	Have you ever figured they might extradite you?
3 I'm not so clumsy with fingerprints--

1 He's certainly good-natured.	"Smooth's" the word.
2 I mean--a lot of gentlemen would be offended if you searched them like that.	It all depends on what you're used to.

1 God damn son of a...	Isn't that a daisy?
2 Just pick up your money and go. Sick of listening to you simper.	Now Ed, are we cross?

1 Easy.  I just wanted to tell you Things're about to start changing Around here.  Lots of so-called Hard cases and tough-nuts swagger Around this town but none of 'em's got a clue about the real play.  None of 'em.	I don't understand.
2 You will after tonight.  Bet on it.

1 Come on, you...	Crack me back of the head like Some stinkin' bull.  Hell, you Ain't no fightin' man, you're Just a cop.

1 On three?  You call it.	Here it come: one-two-

1 Doc!  How the hell are you?	Perfect, Wyatt.  Simply perfect.

1 Wyatt!  Just in time.  Pull up a chair.	Been hittin' it awful hard, Doc.
2 Nonsense, I have not yet begun to Defile myself.	But Doc-
3 I won't be pawed at, thank you Very much	Sorry, sorry...

1 Don't touch me!	Sorry...

1 But I'd do it, I'd get that one Into him.  So help me God, I would.	All right Wyatt, maybe you can. But you gotta die to do it. Understand?  You gotta die!

1 We've never actually met.  My Name's-	Wyatt Earp, I know.  I was Beginning to think we'd never Meet.  This is fortuitous.  That Means lucky.
2 I know what it means.

1 Sorry about your friend.  And I'm sorry about...	I forgave you the moment you said it.
2 You did.  Well... thank you.

1 No, stay.  Please stay with me.	Honey, I gotta start makin' money.
2 Oh, all right.	Well I guess I don't have to go Right now.  I guess I could stay a little while.
3 No, no, I don't want to keep you.	No really, I can stay a while.
4 Just go.  It's all right.  Wyatt, Really.  Work well.	All right, well, good night.

1 I ain't your brother, I ain't None of your damn brothers.  Move!	All right, run 'em off.

1 Really?  What about hell?  They got A sign or what?	Hey, Wyatt, God damn it, I'm serious!

1 Get down, boy.	Morgan, are you crazy?  They're Out gunning for us!  What the Hell're you doin'?
2 What's it look like?  They want a Piece of me they can come and get It, I'm not crawlin' into my hole.	Morg, use your head.
3 I am usin' it, Wyatt.  Been Wonderin' how the hell we got in This tangle.  You know they hit Clum's house, too?  Shot up his wife. His wife.  Who ever heard of That?  Men sneakin' around in the Dark, back-shootin', scarin' Women?  They're bugs, Wyatt.  You Know all your smart talk about Live and let live?  Ain't no live And let live with bugs.	I know, I was wrong.  But Morg, Look, we got to get out.
4 Listen to yourself, Wyatt.  Lie Down and crawl or you might get Hurt?  What kinda talk is that? That's Virgil lyin' over there, Wyatt.  Our own brother.  Ruined For life.  No sir, I ain't going No place.  You want to go, fine. I'm stayin' right here and have It out with those bastards.

1 We should get moving.	Doc's just in no kinda shape.

1 Maybe I jumped the gun.  Maybe Those Cowboys aren't near as bad As they're painted.  You know I Was thinkin', there's a lot of Money in the cattle business...	Wait a minute, you thinkin' of Getting in bed with the Cowboys?
2 Business is business.  Don't have To love 'em to work with 'em.  Not If there's money in it.	You are the one, Wyatt.  You sure are.

1 ... What were you saying, Admiral? Something about this 'not being a job for a wine-sniffing, skirt-chasing playboy spy?'	- I'll be sure to acknowledge 007's 'assistance' in my report to the Prime Minister. But this is, still, a naval operation.
2 What do they say in Russia, General Bukharin? 

1 How did you get this number?	Oh, please, Mr. Bond. We live in the information age! Information is currency - and with the right currency, you can have any piece of information.  Besides I own the phone company. What do you say? Twenty minutes?
2 I'm on my way.

1 ...And what's that, my dear?	Sidney, perhaps we should leave this to -

1 By the way, James: Ordinarily I would never ask, but... Weren't you and that Colonel once stranded on a raft for two weeks in the Sargasso Sea?	Moneypenny! How indiscreet! Have you ever known me to kiss and tell?

1 Oh, James. I've missed you -	Is this another one of your games?
2 Stop it! You're hurting me! Can't you just be nice?	I've got half the British government breathing down my neck. I don't have time for your nonsense.

1 There is one last thing, 007: Elliot Harmsway is vital to the economic interests of this nation. He's also a major contributor to the party. I expect him to be given every consideration.	Political considerations?
2 To the best of my recollection, Mr. Bond, I suggested no such thing.  In fact, I was never here.

1 What do you want with the Harbor Master?	Tide and current charts. Work backward from the body - find where the ship sank.  Where did you get the boat?
2 Seized it from a guy smuggling computer chips out of Bangkok.  Should have seen his rose garden: Blooms the size of hand grenades.

1 ... Does this do anything?	Depends what number you write.

1 I hope you'll be gentle.	Think about mom.

1 What the hell does that do?	Cleans dirt. Let's go.

1 ... Yes???	Before we go any further here, Mr. Bond, from Lloyds of London, I just want to get two things straight.
2 ... Yes?	First, that boat is in international waters. I'm claiming it for salvage. One-third of that gold is mine.
3 And number two?	If you think we're going to have some kind of 'life affirming' romance here just because we cheated death, let me be clear:  We're going to have it where I want, and when I want.
4 And when might that be?	Now.

1 ...I'll give you a ring from Venice.	Good luck on your mission, 007.

1 My name is Sidney Winch, and -	Good for you, Miss Winch. You now have exactly 30 seconds to get this rust bucket out of here.
2 I know my rights. These are international waters. The British Navy abandoned that boat, and I'm claiming it. Under international law, I have the right to salvage what's on that wreck.	Fifteen seconds. Perhaps you should consider hiring an attorney.
3 I was an attorney!	Hmmm. I suppose this is a step above that profession.  Ten seconds. Are you leaving?
4 No.	You leave me no alternative.

1 ...Well! I do believe this requires further investigation!	Thank you, Uncle Elliot.
2 No matter what the British government says, I won't kill this story.  Miss Oxford will show both of you to the elevator... And one of my people will definitely be in touch sooner than later.

1 They're on the bridge. Seal off the 50th floor!	I should have hired this man.  Get somebody up there!

1 Will it go off?	Maybe. Maybe not.
2 Abort the cruise.

1 Why in the hell didn't you help mama?	I told her I would if she would give me time.
2 I bet you if your master would have told you to fix the hole in the roof, you would have rebuilt the whole damn house.	You always got the best of it around here and when Dad always talks about my son, it is always you, so you fix the roof.
3 That is a damn lie and you know it. Every time father asks you to do something, you either half-ass do it or run off and hide. Mama asked you to turn the dirt in her garden and you told her, with your smart ass self, that you weren't a farmer; get Junior to do it. Every time someone asks you to do something, you always say, tell Junior to do it. Boy, you ought to grow up.	I told you about calling me boy. I ain't no boy. See, you and Dad got a bad habit of calling me boy. You call me boy in front of my wife. You think I'm going to fix the roof? I hope the wind blows the whole damn thing off and it pours down rain.
4 I ought to break your damn neck.

1 I have more sense than to give up everything, my family, you and Sunny. It wasn't me, I mean the real me inside my body. I'm glad it's over. It's like a veil has been lifted.	Like a veil has been lifted?
2 It's like I've been swimming in muddy waters.	Like muddy waters?
3 It was like all those things old country people try to tell you what hell is like.	You were in hell?
4 I couldn't believe the things I was doing. It was like an internal struggle going on inside my body.	Do you think you won?
5 It was nip and tuck.	And what lesson have we learned from all of this, Babe Br... Sam... I mean Samuel?
6 I guess it proves you really care about me. You hung in there.

1 I could swear I heard my son call me.	You probably heard the wind stirring up those dead leaves over there.
2 I heard his voice as clear as day. I better get back. Maybe something is wrong.

1 Let us go back in before the night of celebration becomes a night of me killing my son.	No. Before anyone moves, you two shake hands and don't carry it any further.

1 Man, put your boxes down and stay as long as you like. We have empty rooms since the boys got their own families and moved out.	Well if you're sure, I won't be a bother. Oh, I don't sleep on no spring mattress. I always make myself a pallet on the floor.

1 One can tell you are from back home. These people nowadays don't know what manners are.	Where we come from, you had to know how to act right. You had to know how to say yes sir and no sir. You had to know your place.

1 Good afternoon, ladies.	Good afternoon to you.

1 None of your business.	That is a boy from home, Lulla's brother.

1 You know Harry lied about how that boy Hocker got kilt. And it was Harry who saw Emory last before they found him hanging over a levee like someone would hang a hog.	I remember Harry always trying to help someone. He got Lulla's daughter out of trouble. He was always running to the store for someone who couldn't leave the house.
2 Harry always shows his good side and, like the moon, the other side is black. Back home he always did try to act like the colored gentleman. I'm telling you Harry is nothing but evil. I'm warning you -- you can't keep a wild animal as a pet around children.

1 Can we leave this up 'til we move?	Well, sure, we can leave it up.
2 Yeah!	Now go get Molly.  Your friends are going to be here any minute.
3 Okay.

1 Mom, have you seen Woody?	Where was the last place you left him?
2 Right here in the van.	Oh, I'm sure he's there.  You're just not looking hard enough.
3 He's not here, Mom.  Woody's gone.

1 Whoooooah!  Oh!  Bo!  There's gotta be a less painful way to get my attention.	Merry Christmas, Sheriff.

1 And another thing.  Stop with this spaceman thing.  It's getting on my nerves.	Are you saying you want to lodge a complaint with Star Command? WOODY Oh okay, so you want to do it the hard way, huh?

1 Buzz!  Buzz, come back!	Go away.

1 Woody, we don't know what's out there!	I'll tell you what's -- AAAAH!

1 Come on, this way!	Years of Academy training...wasted!!

1 Ha-ha!!	You did it!  Next stop.  Andy.

1 Something's screwy here.	So, you see?  We're friends now, guys.  Aren't we, Buzz?  You bet.  Gimme a hug.

1 Sid, give her back!  Give her back now!  I'm telling!	Patient is...  ...pre-e-epped.

1 Well, obviously she wanted to have the party before the move.  I'm not worried.  You shouldn't be worried.	Of course Woody ain't worried! He's been Andy's favorite since kindergarten!

1 No!  No!  Don't leave!  Don't leave! You've gotta help us, please!  You don't know what it's like over here!	Come on.  Let's get out of here.

1 What the heck is up there?	Woody?  Who's up there with you?

1 There.	Juvenile intrusion!  Repeat! Resume your positions NOW!
2 Andy's coming, everybody!  Back to your places.  Hurry!

1 Hey, Slinky?	Right here, Woody!

1 You'll need to know who we are, we're the brothers of his wife, which makes us in an unsanctified kind of way, your uncles. Me name is Finn, me brother is called Francie -	But you're Irish!
2 There's no law, as I know of, to prevent it.

1 Don't fret. It's only his dream. Dreams aren't catching, not like measles.	I didn't know about the puppets. It's a lot to take in, all at once.

1 You <i>are</i> cold. Where have you been?	I finished it off.
2 You did what?

1 They're going to fly everywhere. Mean things. They should have taken us.	We're too young.
2 I'm not too young. Juliet was my age.	Juliet who?
3 In the play. She was married, by my age. And Mummy. Mummy wasn't much older than me when she got married. Well, not <i>that</i> much older.

1 What?  What is it?	It's very hard for me to come and tell you this.

1 This place is swept twice a day.  I learned that in Miami in '85.  Then the U.S. shut down the whole Caribbean, but it's a big game of wack-a-mole.  Knock it down in Miami, it pops up here.  And San Diego is so much more relaxing.	Arnie, I need money.  Somebody threatened my children.  They want a first payment of three million dollars.
2 Helena, if I had it I would give it to you, but I don't have that kind of money.	Arnie, help me.  Doesn't anyone owe us money?
3 Yes, I told you before, there are people who owe you money but they're not paying.  There's too much heat on Carl.	Please.  Tell me who Carl sells to.

1 Arnie, do think there's a difference between a reason and an excuse, because I don't think there is.	Carl --
2 Goodbye Arnie.

1 My Leica's gone.	So's the video camera.
2 At least she's alive.

1 We'll get through this, I promise. I'll make it up to you --	How?  Supportive letters from prison while I'm being kicked out of our home?  Do you have any idea what is happening out here?  Our credit cards are maxed. The people at the bank, you should see their faces when I walk in there. I have a letter from the government telling me that anything I sell from our house will be taken against an income tax lien.  Our friends are behaving like the crowd at a public hanging.  Nobody will help us.  Nobody will take us in.  Nobody wants anything to do with us.  So tell me, Carl, how you're gonna make it up to me.  Tell me again how we'll get through this, and maybe while you're at it you can put your hand up against the glass so we can have a tender moment of connection.
2 Helena --	Tell me what to do, Carl.  I need guidance, not a fucking platitude.  I'm not bringing a child into the kind of life I grew up with.  I won't do it.  I want our life back.

1 Inhale the smoke and hold it.	What is this, like freebase?
2 Not like.  It is.

1 You should see little Montel play. Little Montel is the next Maradona.	Maradona is a cokehead.  Hand of God, my ass.  We're wasting our time here.
2 He won.  He was a winner.  That bothers you.	Winners don't do coke.  Or haven't you been reading the bumper stickers?

1 You were followed by the police, but they won't hear us over the children. I want to use a bomb.	You're kidding.  Can't you shoot him or something?
2 I don't really like guns.  You shoot someone in the head three times and some doctor will keep them alive.	When will you do it?
3 I don't know.  Eduardo Ruiz is the only real witness against Carl.  The security is very tight.  There may not be a way.	There's always a way.  If people get to the Pope or the President, you can get to him.

1 I want to know who is responsible for this treatment.	Yes, sir!
2 We aren't barbarians.	Yes, sir!
3 Bring this man a change of good clothes.  Has he eaten?	I don't know, sir.
4 You will dine with me from now on.

1 If you want her to stay out of it, then stop telling her everything. You should learn how to keep a secret.	She's nosy.  She hears me on the telephone.
2 Anyway, I don't think we'll ever see them again.  Everything's back to normal.

1 What's your name?	Javier Rodriguez.
2 Well, Javier Rodriguez, you've done a very good job, but we'll take care of it from here.

1 I'm looking for my daughter, Caroline. She comes here.	This is a business.  Get the fuck outta here.
2 I need to find my daughter.  I'll pay you.

1 Salazar's been taken down.  He was working for Porfirio Madrigal.	What?  I thought Madrigal was dead. I thought it was verified.
2 Apparently not.  Look, it's a shit storm here right now.  When are you coming back?  I don't know what to tell people any more.	I'll get there as soon as I can.
3 If we're moving the press conference, we need to do it now.  Are you all right?

1 I don't know, maybe I'll buy something for my ma, and then buy some good speed, no bicarb like, then get a girl, take her out like, and treat her -- properly.	Shag her senseless.
2 No, I don't mean like that -- I mean something nice, like, that's all --	You daft cunt. If you're going to waste it like that, you might as well leave it all to me. Now get the drinks in.

1 This was his nightmare. The dodgiest scam in a lifetime of dodgie scams being perpetrated with three of the most useless and unreliable fuck-ups in town. I knew what was going on in his mind: any trouble in London and he would dump us immediately, one way or another. He had to. If he got caught with a bagful of skag, on top of that armed robbery shit, he was going down for fifteen to twenty. Begbie was hard, but not so hard that he didn't shite it off twenty years in Saughton.	Did you bring the cards?

1 What do you want?	Are you clean?
2 Yes.	Is that a promise, then?
3 Yes, as a matter of fact, it is.	Calm down, I'm just asking. Is that hash I can smell?
4 No.	I wouldn't mind a bit, if it is.
5 Well, it isn't.	Smells like it.
6 You're too young.	Too young for what?

1 No, actually I went to Craignewton but I was worried that you wouldn't have heard of it so I put the Royal Edinburgh College instead, because they're both schools, right, and we're all in this together, and I wanted to put across the general idea rather than the details, yeah? People get all hung up on details, but what's the point? Like which school? Does it matter? Why? When? Where? Or how many O grades did I get? Could be six, could be one, but that's not important. What's important is that I am, right? That I am.	Mr. Murphy, do you mean that you lied on your application?
2 Only to get my foot in the door. Showing initiative, right?	You were referred here by the Department of Employment. There's no need for you to get you "foot in the door", as you put it.
3 Hey. Right. No problem. Whatever you say, man. You're the man, the governor, the dude in the chair, like. I'm merely here. But obviously I am. Here, that is. I hope I'm not talking too much. I don't usually. I think it's all important though, isn't it?

1 You Only Live Twice?	Nineteen-sixty-seven.
2 Running time?	One hundred and sixteen minutes.
3 Director?	Lewis Gilbert.
4 Screenwriter?	Eh - Ian Fleming?
5 Fuck off! He never wrote any of them.	OK, so who was it, then?
6 You can look it up.

1 Why?	Well, this guy I've met runs a hotel. Brother. Loads of contacts. Does a nice little sideline in punting British passports to foreigners. Get you a good price.
2 Why would I want to sell my passport?	It was just an idea.

1 It's the great outdoors.	It's really nice, Tommy. Can we go home now?
2 It's fresh air.	Look, Tommy, we know you're getting a hard time off Lizzy, but there's no need to take it out on us.
3 Doesn't it make you proud to be Scottish?

1 I couldn't help but notice you pain.	My pain?
2 It runs deep. Share it with me.

1 Mr. Chekov, I've lost the Bird of Prey. She must have cloaked.	Raise shields.
2 But the shuttle-	DO it. Go to Red Alert.

1 Where did you get this power?	The power was within you.
2 I feel as if a weight has been lifted from my heart. How can I repay you for this miracle?	Join my quest.
3 What is it you seek?	What you seek. What all men have sought since time began - ultimate knowledge. But to find it we'll need a starship.
4 A starship? There are no starships on Nimbus III.	Perhaps I have a way to bring one here.
5 But how?	Have faith, my friend. There are more of us than you know.

1 Standard orbit, Mr. Sulu.	Captain, we're receiving transmission from Paradise City. They're demanding to know our intentions.
2 Respond with static. Let them think we're having difficulty. Which wouldn't be far from the truth.	Paradise City, can you boost your power? We're barely receiving transmission.
3 Transporter room. Status.

1 "Pack Up Your Troubles."	Are we leaving, Captain?

1 He rejected his logical upbringing and embraced the animal passions of our ancestors.	Why?
2 He believed the key to self-knowledge was emotion, not logic.

1 You mean he's your brother brother?  You made that up!	I did not.
2 You did too. Sybok couldn't possibly be your brother because I happen to know for a fact that you don't have a brother.	Technically, you are correct. I do not have a brother.
3 There, you see? See?	I have a half brother.
4 I gotta sit down.

1 Spock... the booster rockets.	If I activate them now, Captain, we will be propelled upward at an unbelievable rate.
2 Fire the rockets!

1 No! No reply. Remain on course.	Sybok, listen to me. In order for this craft to enter the landing bay, Enterprise must lower the shields and activate the tractor beam. To get us inside and re-raise the shields will take-

1 	
2 	

1 Spock, you've developed a sense of humor after all.	It was not my intention to amuse you. These are serious charges. However, if you surrender now-
2 I'm sorry, Spock. I can't surrender now. I'm not through violating Neutral Zone Treaty. In fact, I'm just getting started. And now for my next violation I intend to steal something. Something very big.

1 Dillinger?	Yeah. Tryin' to find the file and erase it. Once that's gone, ain't nothin' can stop him. Just Eddie and his Master Control Program, runnin' things from on high..

1 For what?	For being on to Dillinger.
2 What -- ?

1 I'm your program?	Right on the money!
2 Another mouth to feed... you don't by any chance know how to drive this crate?

1 That was uncalled-for.	I'm sorry, Walt. So much pressure lately... you feel like going for a drink?
2 Thank you, no. I have some work to do... assuming I can still log on.

1 Flynn!!	Greetings, program...
2 You're alive!	Yeah, I... oops!

1 The MCP blasted it... There are very few domains left with any power at all.	Lousy utility companies ... they're the same wherever you go.

1 He was disoriented in transport, Tron.	Yeah, but I'm remembering all kinds of stuff. Like...my User wants me to go after the MCP

1 I'm afraid it's a little late for that. Dillinger's shut off Group 7 access. He must know what you're up to.	Boy, I bet I know who's workin' late tonight.

1 Yes...acknowledge, Master Control...	End of line.

1 Yes...it can take us across the Sea of Simulation... all the way out of the Game Grid...to the MCP.	As long as it gets us out of here

1 Dinner's in the warmer.  Tell your father I may be late.	Where are you going?
2 Out.

1 Immediate roll.  Acquire subject at K Street and Key Bridge.     * Vehicle is red-and-white      * convertible.  You have six minutes.	Roger, One.  Rolling.

1 Kids.  Ten seconds of joy. Thirty years of misery.	She knows not to steal.  I've taught her better than that.
2 Yeah, but you're not her parents, anymore, you and Helen.  Her parents are Axl Rose and Madonna. The five minutes you spend a day with her can't compete with that kind of constant bombardment. You're outgunned, amigo.

1 What?  It's on the way.  She says she's got something for me.	Yeah, right.

1 Abu Kaleem Malik.	Hardcore, highly fanatical, ultra-    * fundamentalist.  Linked to     * numerous car-bombings, that cafe    * bomb in Rome, and the 727 out of Lisbon last year.  Major player.    *

1 She's lying.	You didn't have sexual relations with him?

1 I'd like to remind you that it has been ten years since you were actually in one of these.	If I break it they can take it out of my pay.

1 So your clients want something for the lobby of their new corporate headquarters?	That's right.  They want something...  dramatic.  I spoke to a number of people who said you're the one to see.

1 I'm late.	Me too.

1 ...and I'm troubleshooting it with them over the phone... talking to a translator, right, who's getting half of it wrong... it was unbelievable...  really wild.	It sounds wild.  So now you're a big hero, right?  For fixing their system.
2 Uh huh.	My husband the hero.

1 I don't know.  I guess I needed something...	What did you need?
2 I needed to feel alive.  I wanted to do something...  outrageous. And... I don't know... it felt good to be needed.  To be trusted.  To be special.

1 Harry, what's the matter with you?  Tell them the truth.  We're married, we have a daughter--	I don't know what this crazy bitch is on.  You should just cut her loose, so we can get down to business.
2 Oh yeah?  Oh yeah?  Then where did I get this?

1 Not yet.  But we'll find him.	Dance?

1 Beat it.	No.  Soon as I turn you'll shoot me.

1 Yes.  I suppose so.  Where?	The same place.  One o'clock.  I have to go now.  See you tomorrow.  Remember, I need you.

1 You see what I mean?  That reaction would give us away in a second.  Try to relax.	It's just that... it's been sixteen years since anyone but Harry did that, I--
2 Relax.  There, that's better. Let yourself slip into the role.

1 Let me speak to Clarence.	He wants to speak with you.

1 Tell him not to eat anything. We're gonna scarf when we get there.	Don't eat anything.

1 Where's your car? I'll walk you to it.	I took a cab.
2 You took a cab to see three kung fu movies?	Sure. Why not?
3 Nothing. It's just you're a girl after my own heart.	What time is it?
4 'Bout twelve.	I suppose you gotta get up early, huh?
5 No. Not particularly.  How come?	Well, it's just when I see a really good movie I really like to go out and get some pie, and talk about it. It's sort of tradition. Do you like to eat pie after you've seen a good movie?
6 I love to get pie after a movie.	Would you like to get some pie?
7 I'd love some pie.

1 Oh, you look so cute as little Elvis.	I finally knew what I wanted when I grew up.

1 No no no no no no no no no...	Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes...

1 I thought it was what you wanted, Clarence.	It is what I want. But I don't want to spend the next ten years in jail. I don't want you guys to go to jail. We don't know what could be waiting for us up there. It'll probably be just what it's supposed to be. The only thing that's waiting for us is two hundred thousand dollars. I'm just looking at the downside.

1 What?	Can you live with it?
2 Live with what?	With that son-of-a-bitch walkin' around breathin' the same air as you? And gettin' away with it every day. Are you haunted?
3 Yeah.	You wanna get unhaunted?
4 Yeah.	Then shoot 'em. Shoot 'em in the face. And feed that boy to the dogs.
5 I can't believe what you're tellin' me.	I ain't tellin' ya nothin'. I'm just sayin' what I'd do.
6 You'd really do that?	He don't got no right to live.
7 Look, Elvis, he is hauntin' me. He doesn't deserve to live. And I do want to kill him. But I don't wanna go to jail for the rest of my life.	I don't blame you.
8 If I thought I could get away with it -	Killin' 'em's the hard part. Gettin' away with it's the easy part. Whaddaya think the cops do when a pimp's killed? Burn the midnight oil tryin' to find who done it? They couldn't give a flyin' fuck if all the pimps in the whole wide world took two in the back of the fuckin' head. If you don't get caught at the scene with the smokin' gun in your hand, you got away with it.

1 Clarence sent a letter?	Has he gotten his mail today?

1 Clarence...	Let me handle this.

1 I'd fuck Elvis.	Really?
2 When he was alive. I wouldn't fuck him now.	I don't blame you.  So we'd both fuck Elvis. It's nice to meet people with common interests, isn't it?

1 Well, I guess it's about that time.	I guess so. Follow me.

1 Oh, Mr. Donowitz -	Lee, Clarence . Please don't insult me. Call me Lee.
2 OK, sorry, Lee. I just wanna tell you "Coming Home in a Body Bag" is one of my favorite movies. After "Apocalypse Now" I think it's the best Vietnam movie ever.	Thank you very much, Clarence.
3 You know, most movies that win a lot of Oscars, I can't stand. "Sophie's Choice", "Ordinary People", "Kramer vs. Kramer", "Gandhi". All that stuff is safe, geriatric, coffee-table dog shit.	I hear you talkin' Clarence. We park our cars in the same garage.
4 Like that Merchant-Ivory clap-trap. All those assholes make are unwatchable movies from unreadable books.

1 Look, I don't know this is pretty heavy-duty, so if you wanna explode, feel free.	You're always making jokes. That's what you do, isn't it? Make jokes. Making jokes is the one thing you're good at, isn't it? But if you make a joke about this -  - I'm gonna go completely out of my fuckin' head!

1 I'm me... I mean, that's me.	Step inside.

1 Suspect's words -	To front for him. So Elliot is workin' out the deal between them and his boss, a big movie producer named Lee Donowitz.
2 He produced "Coming Home in a Body Bag".

1 You OK? That stupid dumb-ass didn't break your nose, did he?	Naw. It don't feel too good but it's alright.

1 You gotta hold this for me.	You must be high. Uh-huh. No way.
2 Just put it in your purse.	I'm not gonna put that shit in my purse.
3 They won't search you. I promise. You haven't done anything.	No way, Jos.
4 Please, they'll be here any minute. Just put it in your bra.	I'm not wearing a bra.
5 Put it in your pants.	No.
6 You're the one who wanted to drive fast.	Read my lips.

1 Women will want to get to know you...	I DON'T WANT YOUR "WOMEN," YOU BRAINLESS TWIT! I WANT TO BE WELL!

1 That's him.	What are you going to do with us?

1 It's just a shot to calm you.	No more drugs.  Please...
2 I have to do this, James.  You're very confused.

1 Look, I'm warning you.  You do anything, I'm going to go crazy -- hurt people!	I'm not going to "do" anything, I promise.  But you need help, James. None of this is what you think it is.

1 You were going to run out off gas on purpose, weren't you?	No.  I want you to turn yourself in, James -- It'll go much better for you if you do -- but I'm not going to trick you.
2 That has your name on it.  Give him cash.

1 You want me to rob him?	I...I...We need cash, James.

1 Does this bother you, Mr. Cole?	No!  Look, I don't belong here!  What I need to do is make a telephone call to straighten everything out.
2 Who would you call, Mr. Cole, who would straighten everything out?	Scientists.  I'm supposed to report in to them.  They'll want to know they sent me to the wrong time.
3 So you could talk to these scientists and they do what?  Send you to the future?	No, no.  I can't talk to them.  It's called, "voice mail".  I'm supposed to leave messages. They monitor it from the present.

1 County Hospital, right?  1989.  The "Immaculate Escape" -- am I right?  Why, thank you -- you look wonderful, too.	Listen to me -- I can't do anything about what you're going to do. I can't change anything.  I can't stop you.  I just want some information...
2 We need to talk.  Come on.  Upstairs.  I am a new person!  I'm completely adjusted.  Witness the tux.  It's Armani.  Who chattered?  Goines?  Weller?	I just need to have access to the pure virus, that's all!  For the future!

1 Don't be defensive, Kathryn, this isn't an inquisition.	I didn't think I was being defensive. I was just...
2 He should have been in restraints.  It was bad judgment on your part, plain and simple.  why not just cop to it?	Okay, it was bad judgment.  But I have the strangest feeling about him -- I've seen him somewhere and...
3 Two policemen were already in the hospital and now we have an orderly with a broken arm and a Security Officer with a fractured skull.	I said it was bad judgment!  What else do you want me to say?
4 You see what I mean?  You're being defensive.  Isn't she being defensive, Bob?

1 Nine thirty	Might be tight.
2 Tight?  My watch says 7:30.	On your normal mornin', okay, plenty a time, but today, gotta take inta account your Army-of-the-Twelve-Monkeys factor.
3 What?  What did you say?	Twelve Monkeys, honey.  Guess you folks didn't turn on your radio this morning.

1 I'll take a piece of that bet. I say it doesn't come up five times each side.	Well, a man with some gumption.  How much money you got?
2 Nothing.	You want to make a kiddies bet?
3 I'll bet my watch against your pay.

1 Please, you don't understand.  I have to get out of here.  They're going to come looking for me. They're going to kill me.  If I can't get this ticket then I'm going to have to do things to get out of here.  I don't want to hurt anybody, I just want to leave.	I'll give you the money!  Okay? I'll give you two-fifty.  Just . . . just, please.

1 Then you're only a hundred-forty- five in the hole.  Now why don't you just take your Visa Express Silver Card, call Karl Malden and have him send you the money lickity split.	I don't have a credit card.  They took my wallet.
2 Now that's too bad.  I sure hope you know how to wash dishes or shovel shit 'cause you're gonna have to work this one off.	You son of a bitch!
3 Sweet talk me all you want, I still want my hundred-forty-five dollars.

1 Poor thing.  Is she all right?	'Cept that she lost her money and the sons of bitches stole her wedding ring.  That's when she started shooting.  Can't blame her. The ring was all Carlos left her when he died.

1 That wasn't so bad.  What's thirty- some-thousand to rich folks like you?  It didn't hurt a bit.	Sheriff Potter.

1 My mother told me never to accept offers from strangers.	My name is John.  Now I'm not a stranger anymore.  See how easy it is for us to get to know each other, beautiful?
2 Do you have to call me that?	I don't know your real name.
3 Maybe I don't want you to.	Maybe, but if you didn't I think you would have kept on walking.
4 You're pretty full of yourself, aren't you?	My cup runneth over, beauti--
5 It's Grace.	May I carry your package, Grace?

1 Must get kind of lonely for a woman living by herself in a big house.	I guess it must.
2 What do you do anyway?	A little of this, a little of that. Mostly I tell fortunes.
3 Where'd you learn to do that?	From my father.  He was the tribe's Shaman.
4 A medicine man?	Those are white words, not ours.
5 Nice house for a Shaman's daughter. You must be good.	Come here.

1 All this nothing?  I've spent my life in this stinking desert.  It doesn't get to Jake like it got to me.  He doesn't mind being out here. He doesn't mind being nothing but a land broker.  Big fish in a small pond, he says.  More like a little fish in a dried up watering hole.	You could just leave him.
2 I don't know how.	You just walk away.
3 It's not that easy.  Maybe you can take chances; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please.  I can't.  I don't want to be alone.  I need to know I'm going to be taken care of.	You need a meal ticket is what you mean.  Some guy you can latch onto just long enough for him to get you out of here.
4 Is that so bad?  It's not like I wouldn't try to make him happy.  For awhile, anyway.  I mean, I would . . . do things for him.  I guess I'm no good that way.  I guess I tried to sucker you along like that.  Do you hate me for it?  I wouldn't blame you if you did.  But maybe it's like you said:  You just got to do whatever it takes to get out.	Whatever it takes.

1 There's easily a hundred-thousand in there.  More than that.	I told you.  I knew it was there. Didn't I tell you?

1 I shot him.	You killed him!
2 He was going to take the money.	Thirty-thousand, that's all.  We would have been free and clear.  You didn't have to kill him.
3 It's our money.  He had no right to take it.

1 John, if you don't throw me the keys, then I'll just walk away. Walk away and leave you here.	Walk to where?  We're fifty miles to the nearest town.  It's going to be over one-hundred degrees today.  How far do you think you're going to get?
2 Someone will find me.	Yeah, they'll find you.  Dried up and twice dead.
3 You idiot!  You'll kill us both!	At least I'll have company when I die.  Ain't that right, Jake?
4 For Christ's sake, John!  Throw me the keys!	What do you say, Jake?  Should we trust her?  No?  I didn't think so.
5 Fuck you!  Do you hear me, John!? Fuck you!  John . . . John!?

1 Good Lord.  What happened to you?	Just ran into a little trouble.
2 Another accident?  You've really got to be more careful.  Can I get you a drink?	No.
3 Hungry?	No.
4 I'm surprised to see you.  I thought you'd be halfway to Vegas by now.	I had a problem getting my car back.
5 You just seem to attract trouble, don't you?

1 Maybe not this time, but somebody's going to get dead around you.	No.

1 You like Patsy Cline?  I just love her.  How come, I wonder, she don't put out no more new records.	She's dead.
2 Gee, that's sad.  Don't that make you sad?	I've had time to get over it.
3 You're not from around here, are you?  Where you from?	Oz.
4 You ain't from Oz.  Oz is in that one movie.	You're too quick for me.

1 Oh, that tears it, Mister.  I'm gonna bust you up but good.  I'm gonna bust you into a million pieces and then . . . and then bust those pieces up, and then . . . and then spread them all around.  That's what I'm gonna do.  You don't know what you're dealing with, Mister.  I'm crazy.  I'm psycho crazy.	Yeah, I know.  You're TNT.  Just like dynamite.  When you go off somebody gets hurt.  All right.  Let's do this.

1 Saw you at the truck stop this morning.  You're not from around here.	No, sir.  And I'm not going to be around long if that's what you're worried about.
2 Just curious.  That's a nasty cut you've got.	Not as bad as it looks.
3 There was a young man over at Jamilla's today when it got hit. Way she tells it he got whacked around by one of the robbers.	Wouldn't know anything about it.
4 That's too bad.  I was hoping you were there.  Maybe you could help us catch the guy who got away.  Or maybe you could explain about all that money that got tore up when Jamilla shot that biker.	Wish I could help, Sheriff.  But if you'll excuse me I'm going over to Harlin's to pick up my car.  Then I'm getting the hell out of this place.
5 Stay as long as you like, son.  No rush.	Maybe not for you, Sheriff, but I think I've had my fill of your little town.

1 No police.	But, Senor--
2 No police!  Wait until I'm gone.	Senor, you need a doctor.
3 No police!

1 Ain't over yet.  Night is part of day; separate, but equal.  Night is when you let your guard down; when you see things in the shadows and hear things in the dark.	Difference between you and me, old man, is I see the glass half full, you see it half empty.
2 Night is when you want to sleep, but the dry heat keeps you tossin' and turnin'. It's when you wish the sun was bakin' high in the sky so you could see what it is you're afraid of.	You afraid of the dark?
3 Afraid of it?  Boy, I live in the dark. All cause of a woman who made me this way. People are afraid of what they can't see. I can't see nuthin', so it's all the same to me.  Kiss from a beautiful woman, kissy kissy kiss, a lick from a dog, slurp, slurp, the kiss of death . It's all the same to me.	So, we're all just floating along like twigs in a stream, so enjoy the ride.  Is that it?
4 More or less.	Not this twig, friend.  I got plans.
5 Nothing makes the Great Spirit laugh harder than a man's plans. We all got plans. I planned on seeing all my life. I know you didn't plan on straying into town.	No and I don't plan on sticking around either.
6 Well, don't say I didn't warn you when things go your way.	You got a lotta philosophy in you, old timer but you don't fool me for one second with all this blind man crap. One minute you lost your eyes in Vietnam, next it's the joint. Now it's a woman? I'm hep to you.

1 Now, what's this?	Give it to me!
2 Mexico?  You going to Mexico?	I'm leaving.  You never have to see me again.  Just please, give me the ticket!
3 This means something to you?  Jenny means something to me.

1 Would you?	Would I what?
2 Would you kill her?

1 Next time you'll do just fine.	No!

1 You like Patsy Cline?  I just love her. How come, I wonder, she don't put out no more new records.	Cause she's dead.
2 Gee, that's sad.  Don't that make you sad?	I've had time to get over it.
3 You're not from around here, are you? Where you from?	Oz.
4 You ain't from Oz.  Oz is in that movie.	You're too quick for me.

1 Twenty-after-ten.	Jesus.  Twenty-after-ten and it must be ninety already.
2 Ninety-two.  Course half hour from now might be seventy-two. These clouds move around a lot.

1 What the fuck did you do to my trunk?	Well, that key's not gonna work. I had to pop the lock. You didn't leave me the trunk key.
2 And you had to go into the trunk, didn't you?	When I work on a car, I work on a car.

1 No, I've got it.	What happened to your hand?
2 Accident.	You should be more careful.

1 You can let go of me now. I'm safe. How do they look?	Like you.
2 Beautiful?

1 Get out of town, Bobby, as quick as you can.	Grace, I've been fucked over too many times, by too many women.  You're becoming the queen of hot and cold.
2 You'd never understand.	Try me.
3 It's just such a mess. With Jake I mean...	Nothing I understand better than a mess.

1 I wanted to talk.	I don't think we have anything to talk about.
2 What about us?	There is no us, remember?
3 Except I can't get you out of my head, Grace. 	Stop it.
4 Why?  Am I making you hot, or does the truth scare you?	Because I know you're full of shit.
5 I mean it, Grace.  I'm getting out of here, and I want to take you with me.	I thought you couldn't get your car.
6 I could if I had Jake's money.	Is that what changed your mind?  The money?
7 I don't give a damn about the money.  I want you, and I want to get us out of this shithole.  There's only one way to do that.

1 Why?	<u>I don't know why</u>!

1 And I love you too.	And love's a funny thing.  Sometimes I don't know if I want to love you...

1 How about Ciudad Juarez? You could take a local, arrives in two hours, and transfer in Albuquerque. It'll get you across the border.	How much?
2 One way, or round trip?	One way.
3 30.55. Twenty more will get you back.

1 Anybody hurt?	Hell, no. That Wayne can't shoot when he's sober, much less drunk. He's lucky he didn't kill his own danged self.  Well, anyhow, you stay cool. Nice meeting you, son.

1 Jake, don't go out there. Call the sheriff.	Shhhh! Just like your Mama, always scared of things...

1 Yes?	Is Noel in?
2 No sir he is not.  I read about you in the paper.	Oh.
3 I was in an accident once too. A horse almost trampled me to death.	Wow.
4 I had to put him down.

1 ...I can't remember.	That's strange isn't it? Not remembering one fever... Or a cold... Or a sore throat. What do you think that means?
2 It means we're probably to tired to remember.

1 Oh. Elijah Price came to visit me at the center today.	Jesus.

1 What's he talking about?	In college. A car accident.
2 Was it serious?

1 I got you a seat in the seven hundred level.  It's nose-bleed territory, but at least you won't get spit on.	How did you know that man you bumped was carrying a weapon?
2 Probably the army jacket. Those guys carry hunting knives and stuff for show.	You thought he was carrying a knife?

1 I am. I'm helping him with the sale.	It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm David Dunne.
2 He's spoken of you. He says you're becoming friends.	We are.

1 No.	I mean if you knew karate?
2 No Jeremy.	What if he wasn't aloud to kick and you were really mad at him?

1 Don't be scared.	Jeremy if you pull that trigger I'm going to leave! I'm going to go to New York.

1 Twelve years.	How did you get together?

1 If they was just here for the fuckin', how come they lit out the back window?	On account of they seen you was beatin' on their friend.

1 He didn't say nothin', huh?	Asked what they looked like, that's all. Christ, maybe he's tough but he sure ain't no carpenter.
2 Maybe he ain't so tough.

1 Free ones?	Alice an' Silky gave them... free ones.
2 Oh. Yeah.	You want... a free one.
3 Me? No. No, I guess not.

1 We got one of them fuckers, Sheriff, out by Cow Creek, we...	Alive?
2 Hell, yeah. A bunch of us Bar T boys went out lookin' on account of them killin' one of our own. We come across this fucker on a roan goin' South an'...	He admit it?
3 No... but I guess he will soon enough. Had a Spencer rifle on him an' he was...	Those cowboys messin' him up?
4 Uh... a little, maybe.	You an' Andy get the hell out there. Find out where them other two went.

1 I don't... deserve this... to die this way. I was... building a house.	"Deserve" don't mean shit, Little Bill.
2 I'll see you... in hell, you three fingered asshole.

1 R-r-r-really? You r-r-really w- wwant...?	Give it to him.

1 You're Pete Sothow's nephew, huh? Hell, I thought maybe you was someone come to kill me...  ...for somethin' I done in the old days.	I could of... easy.
2 Yeah, I guess so.	Like I was sayin' you don't look like no meaner than hell cold-blooded damn killer.
3 Maybe I ain't.	Well, Uncle Pete said you was the goddamndest meanest sonofabitch ever lived an' if I ever wanted a partner for a killin', you was the worst one. Meanin' the best. On account of you're cold as snow an' don't have no weak nerve nor fear.

1 Say, Bill. That business in Jackson County... did that really happen? I mean how they say it happened?	What business?
2 An' how there was two deputies up close pointin' rifles at you... had you dead to rights... an' how you pulled out a pistol an' blew them both away to hell... an' only took a scratch yourself.  Uncle Pete told me he never seen nothin' like it, shootin' your way out of a scrape like that.	Well... I don't recollect.
3 You don't recollect!

1 You're gonna lose your share. If you don't...	Shut up, Kid.

1 It's a hell of a thing, ain't it, killin' a man. You take everythin' he's got... an' everythin' he's ever gonna have...	Well, I gu-guess they had it... comin'.
2 We all got it comin', Kid.

1 How long you gonna be, Bill?	Two weeks, I guess.
2 This Kid, what's he like?

1 Shit.	How far kin you see?

1 You want the Spencer, Bill? 	Shit, Ned, this ain't the time to quit.

1 I was only checkin' it for you. Thought maybe somethin' was bent.	Nothin's bent.
2 Well, you was shootin' every which way an'...	You gonna share your half with him?

1 He's gonna die, ain't he?	Maybe.
2 Well, suppose he does?	We'll bury him.
3 That ain't what I mean.	You mean, am I gonna help you kill them cowboys?
4 I can't spot 'em myself but you could. That red-haired one, you could spot a half-mile off, I bet.	An' if I spot 'em?
5 I'll ride up close an' shoot 'em!	Just like that?
6 I told you I'm a damn killer. I done it before.  I'm more killer than him.	Yeah?
7 Hell, yeah.

1 Now remember, this is another kind of business. They don't earn your respect. You owe it to them. Don't stare them down but don't look away either. Confidence. They are fools not to trust you. That's the attitude.	I'm having a stroke.
2 You've come far. You're a good man. I love you.

1 Forget him. It's not important. I was trying to make a point.	This whole thing was a shakedown.

1 You heard right.	The word I got is you hung up your spurs, man. What's that all  about?

1 How do you do?	Verb - Roger, this is Edie Finneran. Edie, this is Roger Kint, he was at

1 How are they going to do it?	McManus wants to go in shooting. I said no way.
2 Fenster and Hockney?	They're pretty pissed off. They'll do anything. Now I got a way to do it without killing anyone: but like I said, they won't let me in without you.
3 Three million?	Maybe more.
4 No killing?	Not if we do it my way.

1 My employer requires your services. One job. One day's work. Very dangerous. I don't expect all of you to live, but those who do will have ninety-one million dollars to divide any way they see fit.	Who's your boss?
2 My employer wishes to remain anonymous.	Don't jerk me off. We all know what this is. You don't work with me if I work with you without knowing who I'm working for. Now let's cut the shit. Who's the man?
3 I work for Keyser Sate.

1 A little of both.	Ain't it a crime? Call if you're interested.

1 That's crazy, Dave and it doesn't matter. He has total immunity and his story checks out. He doesn't know what you want to know.	I don't think he does. Not exactly, but there's a lot more to his story. I want to know why twenty-seven men died on that pier for what looks to be ninety-one million dollars worth of dope that wasn't there. Above all, I want to be sure that Dean Keaton is dead.

1 That was all Fenster and McManus.	Come on. Keaton was a cop for four years. Who else would know the Taxi Service

1 You're stalling, Verbal.	Give a guy a break, huh?
2 What happened?

1 No...	Keaton was Keyser Soze
2 NO.

1 Why did he go to see Mary Rooney?	She's the only nurse who isn't testifying for the Doctors.
2 What did he find?	Nothing.
3 How good's your intelligence?	Very good.
4 And so what is the rest of his case aside from Dr. Thompson?	As far as we know, nothing.

1 No, actually, she was referred to me.  She was Dr. Hagman's patient...	Don't equivocate.  Be positive. Just tell the truth.

1 I did.	Objection.

1 Please sit down.  I told your wife. I'm sorry that we have to meet out here.  I've got a case coming in two days in the  Superior Court and my office is a mess of papers.	... that's all right.
2 I was telling your wife, we have a very good case here.

1 Dr. Thompson...?	It was good of you to meet...

1 They called, they're going to settle, what I want to do is build up as much ...	Right.  Who called?
2 The Archdiocese called, they want to settle ... her estate ...	... and you're going to do that?
3 Yes.	You're going to settle out of court?

1 Now, have you boys tried to resolve your little difficulty because that certainly would save the Commonwealth a lot of time and bother.	This is a complicated case, your Honor...
2 I'm sure it is, Frank:  and let me tell you something.  If we find it so complex, how in the hell you think you're going to make a jury understand it?   See my point?  Let's talk a minute. Frank: what will you and your client take right now this very minute to walk out of here and let this damn thing drop?	My client can't walk, your Honor.
3 I know full well she can't, Frank. You see the Padre on your way out and he'll punch your ticket.  You follow me?  I'm trying to help you.

1 Nothing further, your Honor...	Mr. Concannon...?

1 Why don't you get some rest?	I've got to work.
2 You can't work if you can't think. You get in bed.  It's all right. I'll stay here with you.  It's all right.  Come on...	You're going to stay here...?
3 Yes.

1 I have to talk to you.	What do you want?
2 Come on.  Let's get a drink.	Don't touch anything.

1 Yeah?  How's our new witness?	D'you find the obstetric nurse?
2 She's workin' the late shift at the Hospital.  She's at home now, I'm going over there to talk to...	Gimme the address.  I'm gonna go. We're going to need her.

1 What are you doing in New York...?	Come on, we'll get a cup of coffee...

1 I've been meaning to come in a long time.	You live in the neighborhood?
2 Uh-huh.  My nephew's going to be staying with us in a few months, so I stopped by.	How old is he?
3 Four.  You're great with these kids.

1 Franky can't make it.  He had an appointment he forgot, he's going to see you later.  I'm Mickey Morrissey, we're supposed to get to know each other.	How'm I doing so far?
2 So far you're great.  You got a cigarette?

1 I didn't mean to be that rough.	No, it sounds idiotic, I know. And you're still the hard-headed Scot, aren't you? Always were. Do you think I'm making it up?
2 No.	I'm not making it up. I wouldn't know how. She'll be talking to me about something, nothing at all, and suddenly the words fade into silence and a cloud comes into her eyes and they go blank... and she is somewhere else, away from me... someone I don't know. I call to her and she doesn't hear. And then with a long sigh she is back, and looks at me brightly, and doesn't know she's been away... can't tell me where... or why...
3 How often does this happen?	More and more in the past few weeks. And she wanders. God knows where she wanders. I followed her one day.
4 Where'd she go?

1 No, please! I Just want to talk to you!	Listen, I'm going to yell in a minute!
2 I'm not going to hurt you! I promise! Please!

1 Will you, Judy?	I suppose I could phone the store in the morning, and say I'm sick.

1 Judy, I want to tell you: these few days have been the first happy days I've had in a year.	I know. Because I remind you of her. The one that's dead. And not even that, very much.
2 No, it's you too, Judy. Something in you.

1 Scottie!	How does it work?
2 Can't you see?	Oh, yeah. There.

1 Did he train you? Rehearse you? Teach you what to say and what to do?	Yes!
2 And you were such an apt pupil! What fun you two must have had, playing games with me! Why me? Why did he pick on me?!!	Your accident...
3 Ah, yes! I was a set-up. I was the made-to-order witness. Where is he now?	I don't know... Switzerland?
4 We'll find him.

1 Lucky for me you were wandering about. Thank you again. I've been terrible bother to you.	No.

1 I hope we will, too.	What?
2 Meet again, sometime.	We have.

1 Where are you now?	Here with you.
2 Where?	The tall trees...
3 Have you been here before?	Yes...
4 When?

1 I'm not mad. I'm not mad. And I don't want to die, but there's someone inside me, there's a somebody else, and she says I must die... Scottie, don't let me go!	I'm here, I've got you...
2 I'm so afraid...  ...you won't let it happen...

1 My love... because I love you.	I love you too... too late... too late...
2 No... we're together...	Too late... there's something I must do...

1 Ow!!	I thought you said no more aches and pains?
2 It's this darned corset. It binds. He retrieves the stick.	No three-way stretch? How very un- chic.
3 Well, you know those police department doctors: no sense of style.  Ah, tomorrow!	What's tomorrow?
4 Tomorrow... the corset comes off. And this thing goes out the window.  I shall be a free man. I shall wiggle my behind... free and unconfined.

1 Johnny!	Oh, damn it! Damn it, damn it --

1 What was this desperate urge to see me?	All I said in the note was: "Where are you?" That doesn't sound desperate to me.
2 Well, I detected an undercurrent.	I just thought if I gave you a drink and fed you some dinner, you'd be so grateful you'd take me to a movie.
3 Fair enough. What'll we talk about at dinner?	Oh... this and that.
4 What I've been doing?	If you want to. Naturally, we won't talk about anything you don't want to talk about.
5 Naturally.

1 The stripper's here.	Excellent.

1 Tonight we return once again to the cave. Tonight we let the monsters out. We fill ourselves with the spirits of Genghis Khan, Joe Namath, JFK, Paton, Lombardi, Hemingway...	Franco mother-fucking Harris!

1 Don't you threaten me you little rat fuck.	Don't you fucking threaten me - I'll fucking kill you.
2 Go home!	You go home!

1 Stop it! Listen to me. Let's just take a second here and take hold of the situation, OK? Let's just review our options here.	We have a dead woman bleeding all over the bathroom. What options? Call the police.
2 Call the police. Okay, that's one option.	That is not an "option." There is no multiple choice here.
3 Yes sir, there sure is an option here. There are always options.

1 We have to get going.	I am not flexible on this.
2 Alright. Let's do it.

1 Honey, go in there and get some Starbursts.	What?
2 They're screaming for Starbursts.	Later.
3 They're screaming like monsters and it's giving me a headache. Go get some fucking Starbursts.

1 I want you to hear me out.	What.
2 You and I have done nothing. You especially. We are innocent.	I don't think so.
3 We are. We go to the police. We tell them the truth. Now. Before they find out. Now. We save ourselves.

1 What?	I'm with Tina. Is she there?

1 Keith Richards, Dean Martin...	Jack Kerouback, Herman Melville, Henry Miller and Hunter S. Thompson. I dedicate this evening to fear and to major loathing. So from sun set to sun rise, let me be heard...

1 Tony? This is Keith Fisher. You're doing my wedding and I'm calling about the chair situation. Yeah, I'll hold.	Who's up for making some real money?

1 That is a load of shit. Personal power has nothing to do with any of this. Tony Robbins has helped me to unlock energy and see my options more clearly, yes, but to give him credit for this, for all of this...Well that's just more than the man deserves.	I think we should say some words over the grave.
2 What kind of words?	I'm talking about prayer.
3 Go ahead.

1 Jesus Boyd you're going to O.D. him.	Suck my ass.

1 Your ideas never work out.	Oh really? Starbucks?

1 Stop it!	Goosed!

1 Why do you feel the need to explore this side of your personality?	What are you talking about?
2 I'm talking about the kind of people you hang out with...about growing up, assuming responsibility of yourself.	I asked you to marry me. I'm ready for marriage. That's responsibility. That's growth.
3 I just think that at some point you're going to have to re-evaluate some of your friendships...	Who else?
4 Charles Moore for instants.	You don't like Moore? Since when?
5 It's not that I don't like him. But the wedding has really got me thinking and... I just keep myself opening up. Crowning. And I want you keeping up with me here.	What does Moore have to do with your growing?
6 I just don't see him in the big picture.	I've known him since Cub Scouts.
7 He's weird.	He's quiet.
8 He's weird.

1 What's the word on the chairs?	I'm working on it.
2 Then you'd better work on it in the car. We gotta go see the Judge.

1 I told Boyd two fucking minutes!	What money?

1 I'm getting married...	I'm sorry...I'm sorry...I'm sorry...

1 The first day.	What?

1 We don't say "love, honor and obey" anymore. And we don't say "till death do us part." Today we say, "respect, honor and cherish, as long as you both do love." How does that sound?	I kind of like "till death do us part." I mean, this is forever. In sickness and in health, through good times and bad. Honey, what do you think?

1 Shut up Micheal.	I KILLED MY BROTHER!

1 They've got a real hen house here! You can't hear yourself speak.	Tell me the answer to this! What bird lays eggs in a barn?

1 I'm going to make you a nun's cake. It will make your mouth water.	You are spoiling me too much. I won't know what to do with myself when you've gone.
2 Only because you want it.

1 You must think I'm mad.	No, Uncle, and now I'm pleased to have been able to do this favor, because, although I didn't think so at first, you are really a good man.

1 Leave me now. You can go to bed.	Yes, sir. Good night.

1 They told us you'd be back tomorrow ...	I didn't want to do it, Don Jorge. They made me ...

1 What's the matter with you?	Nothing.
2 Why the bad temper?	It's Viridiana. She's getting on my nerves.

1 Maybe afterwards he'll let me ...	If you free me, you'll be a rich man ...

1 Jorge, Don Jaime's son, at your service.	I've been expecting you; I got a letter from the lawyer.

1 And ...your friend?	She's left.
2 Is she coming back?	No.
3 Why?

1 Why are you crying?	I'm afraid.
2 Don't invent stories; go to bed.	A black bull came.
3 A black bull!

1 But why does he want to see me? He has never bothered about me.	He has paid for your studies and your maintenance, and he has just sent your dowry. Does that mean so little to you, Viridiana?

1 What about you, Manuel?	I'm only good at making people laugh.
2 That's all right; we all laugh here, but not at you; I'll see to that.

1 I'm going to the hen house. Are you coming with me?	No, I don't want to.

1 There's already a task force out looking for Lindenmeyer. Every other officer in the city will be hunting Sid right along with you.	But only you will know he's not human.

1 This is the personnel file on the programmer, Lindenmeyer. There might be something in it you can use.	She wasn't part of the deal, Cox.
2 Fine  you want to stay here?

1 Ms. Deane, you wanted to see me?	We have an emergency situation which requires somebody with expertise in criminal psychology. Under the authority vested in me by the President, I'm giving you temporary reassignment.
2 What's the assignment?	You're going to put your theories to practice. I'm sending you into the field.

1 You embarrassed me in front of the highestranking law enforcement official in the country.  Do you have any idea how much money you just cost me?	The reason you insisted on testing my system with prisoners is because of the increased risks involved with increased realism.
2 Of the six prison inmates you've tested  all of whom have had at least some military or survival training - only Mr. Barnes is still breathing.	I'm still making adjustments...
3 You've had a yearandahalf to make all the adjustments you want, Lindenmeyer.  ) Elizabeth Deane does not give second chances. Neither do I. You're fired.	I'M WHAT?!
4 You are to turn over the Sid 6.7 program, and all its documentation, for immediate destruction. Is that understood?	I understand... I understand perfectly.

1 Don't be angry with me, Daryl.	Did you recognize the son-of-a bitch who got away?
2 Should I have?	Think hard -- it'll come to you...

1 I don't need a babysitter.	What you need is a collar.

1 Remember a few years ago when music schools were using a computerized teaching tool that accidently started frying kids' brains?	I've been in prison, remember?
2 The government must have figured there was no better person to create a psycho than a psycho.	Just like they figured there was no better person to catch one...

1 Don't get out of the car.	Stop me.

1 Grimes is back! He's back! He's come back!!!	No! Grimes isn't back. He's only one part of Sid. Sid 6.7 is a hell of a lot worse than Grimes ever was.  Get a hold of yourself!

1 You okay?	...I think so...You?
2 More or less.	Lindenmeyer?
3 My guess is dead.	Sid?
4 I don't know.

1 What C-4...was Cox talking about?	Let me put it to you this way... whether I'm here...or whether I'm not...I'm leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night.
2 Where did you plant the C-4?!

1 ...tonight...	You're with him tonight, watching the President's Speech, when the President...
2 What if he's busy tonight?	<u>Lure</u> him. 
3 What are you saying...	Well, darlin' <u>I</u> ain't your confessor.  Tell him you've got some info on the President's sex scandal, it's on your conscience, believe me, he'll drop what he's doing.  Okay;  <u>Now</u>:  Folks, folks, folks, this is a shitty business, and it needs no Ghost Come From the Grave to tell us that.  But in Six Days, Lord willing n'Jesus Tarries, I am going to take you beauties into the second term. .....wait til you hear the speech tonight.  The 3-0-3 Speech... where's the Fad King, by the way...
4 ...on the way in.	When you...  What?  I'm busy.
5 It's the White House.	<u>Hello</u>.  What?

1 A small, "calico" kitten, sir.  "Calico." 	...can we have a white one...?
2 Can we have a white one, please...

1 <u>IT DESTROYED THE ELECTORAL PROCESS</u>.	Come on.
2 ...where?	Come on.

1 We're going to have to explain away the...	They caught him in the closet with a Girlscout.  Side- effects of a pill ain't gone trump that.  You have to keep'em guessing for  Two weeks.  You  don't have to Cure Cancer, Pal, you just have to give them something more interesting than...

1 Yes.	Why?
2 What do you know about them?	...<u>nothing</u>...
3 Precisely.	What did Albania ever do to us?
4 What did they ever do <u>for</u> us...?  You see, this is why we have to mobilize the B-2 Bomber.	...you want us to go to War with Albania.
5 Here's what you got to do:  Get your Press Office, Right now.  To deny;  There <u>is</u> no report of Albanian Activity.  They have to deny it. Now, get the C.I.A.

1 None of these are ours.  <u>None</u> of em are ours....  ....that's <u>real politik</u>, Buddy.	Waal, I gotta tell you.  I've been inside the Beltway fourteen years, and I feel like I Just Got My Feet Wet.

1 Pride of a job-well-done...	It's the Pride of a Job Well Done, Stanley, yes, but it's <u>more</u> than that.

1 Oh, MiGod.	Guess who <u>I</u> am.
2 I'd like to mention a few <u>names</u>, who...	I know who you are, Mr. Ames.
3 I was acting as a Private Citizen.  Nothing that I've done should be construed as reflecting on the orders or intentions of anyone with whom you may have reason to believe I am connected with.  Or in whose <u>employ</u>...	Quite touching.
4 And I take this <u>opportunity</u> to suggest that, equally, I admit to <u>nothing</u>, and that I would like my lawyer present.	Guess what?  We show, and N.S.A. confirms, there <u>are</u> no nuclear devices on the Canadian border.  There are no nuclear devices in Albania.  Z'at put us in something of a pickle?  Albania <u>has</u> no nuclear capacity.  Our spy satellites show "no secret terrorist camps" in The Albanian Hinterland.  The F.B.I. and the Border Patrol, And the R.C.M.P. report no repeat no untoward activity along our picturesque Canadian Border.  The Albanian Government is screaming its innocence, the world is listening.  There is no War.

1 YOUNG PERSON'S APARTMENT, NIGHT.	...we will <u>not</u> be swayed, will, will not be <u>swayed</u> from <u>Every</u> effort to find <u>our</u> Old Shoe, our...

2 What do you think would hold it off?	Uh, <u>nothing</u>, oh, <u>nothing</u> ... uh... a <u>War</u>, uh...  You're kidding.
3 I'm a Jew in Show Business.  Why come to me?	I'm gonna <u>tell</u> you why...
4 Here's the Short Course:  Fifty-Four, Forty or Fight. What does <u>that</u> mean?	Uh, it's a slogan.  From, uh...

6 Tippecanoe and Tyler, Too!	...uh ... No, that's...
7 We remember the slogans, we can't even remember the fucking <u>wars</u>.  Y'know why.  Cause it's <u>show business</u>. That's why I'm here.  Naked girl, covered in Napalm. Five marines Raising the Flag, Mount Suribachi. Churchill, V for Victory, Y'remember the Picture, fifty years from now, they'll have forgotten  the war.  Gulf War?  Smart Bomb, falling through the roof.  2500 missions a day, 100 days, <u>One Shot</u> of One Bomb.  The American people bought that war. M'I getting through to you?  War in the Balkans, don't mean nothing, till some G.I. flyer, went down, Eating Snakes for Ten days. N'then It's show business, Mister Moss.  That's why I'm here.

No, no, put him on.  Put him on.  President wants to reveal Scbumann before the election.	Big mistake.

Hold out til after you're married. That's... that's.... looky, we're offering'em Schumann, make em <u>vote</u> for hhhh.... psychologically, they will understand that that's the bargain.  Make them pay for him.  Make... that's right, the price is their vote. Now, we bring him home, the President announces he is flying <u>home</u>, he's <u>here</u>, he's <u>there</u>... f'there the election, TA DA, here he is.  Have him say it like I wrote it, It'll be fine. Thanks.  Labor, five bucks an hour.  If you <u>watch</u>, <u>ten</u> bucks an hour.  If you <u>help</u> ... if you <u>help</u>, a <u>hundred</u> bucks an hour.
4 Hey, lcokit:  <u>any</u> business...	Ain't <u>that</u> the truth. 
5 Whattaya gonna do when this is all over?	What am <u>I</u> gonna do?  I'm gonna "Fade Away."  What are you gonna do?
6 Well, I'll be damned if I <u>know</u> ... you know... doing this <u>thing</u> ...  You know what the worst word is, in the English Language?  It's retirement."  What the <u>hell</u> was I thinking of?  Hell, I used to...

1 Just....do what I ...look:  get me a ...hello...? Hel...?  I'm going to need an <u>ambulance</u>, we take him, the last moment, right from the Pl...no, <u>we</u> land, we puttem <u>in</u> the ambulance.  Air force jet lands, we take somebody <u>else</u> off <u>that</u> jet...what the fuck do <u>I</u> care? Somebody in a Hospital gown.  And we need a ......hello?  Hello...?

3 An anti-psychotic...	It's an anti-psychotic, the num...  the number...hello...hello...

1 No, I'm On Top of it...	"...unsure whether or not Enemy Action..."
2 No, I'm fine... I got it together....	...but...
3 You got a dime....?

1 Headshots.  Girls to play the girl in our footage.  I like the sorrowful one.  Anybody Else....? 	...what is this?

1 Shoes, Hats....	The special hats of the Special Anti-terrorist detachment of the Border Patrol.

1 They guard our, <u>you</u> know ... "borders," night and day...	Yeah, good good good good good.  And They're <u>So</u> <u>Secret</u>...

1 This is <u>nothing</u>,  Wait'll you've worked with a movie star, one time, this is nothing, we keep him shot-up and happy -- the Old Days, I used to think I was a <u>pharmacist</u>, the kind of stuff I had to do.  One time...	Cause the beans, y'know, y'can tell if they're <u>puttin</u> stuff in it.

1 Who the hell's out there? What are the arbs saying? It's gotta be a big hitter.	They don't know what's going on!

1 Buddy boy, how ya doing?	Great Charlie, any better it'd be a sin.

1 Nice guy but a loser. Lost all his equity when his firm went belly up in the recession of 71. you wanna be coming in here in your late sixties still pitching? ... Whatever happened to that cute analyst at Thudder, Wicks? ... Cindy? Susan?	Cindy. Having sex with her is like reading the Wall Street Journal 'cept the Journal don't talk back. 'Sides this AIDS crap is ruining romance, nobody trusts anybody anymore, gotta get a blood test in the toilet before you leave a bar together, somebody oughtta invent an AIDS dipstick, no kidding, make a fortune. I gotta get to work... Z's today. 

1 ...Got a 100 on me, you...	Not in here Dad... please. Later.

1 ...as far as being axed, I'm still here and as long as I am, I have a responsibility not just to me but to the union members I represent...	Your responsibility, Dad, is to present the facts, not your opinions, to the men... you're gonna destroy their lives, Dad! Don't do it to 'em. Give it a chance. Let the membership decide for themselves, Dad. Please.
2 I'll be damned that when my men come to me tomorrow morning, wanting to know what's going on, I'm going to lie to them!	Your men! All my life "your men" have been able to count on you? Why is it that you've never been there for me?

1 So, where are we going?	Wherever you like, Lutece, 21, the River Cafe...or maybe we can just drive around for a while.  Work up an appetite.

1 Chart break-out on this one here...uh Whitewood-Young Industries...low P.E. Explosive earnings. 30% discount from book. Great cash flow. Coupla 5% holders. Strong management.	It's a dog, what else you got, sport, besides connections at the airport?

1 Know the name?	'Course. Larry Wildman. One of the first raiders.
2 Sir Larry Wildman. Like all Brits he thinks he was born with a better pot to piss in... bribed an old secretary of mine to open bar mouth and stole RDL Pharmaceuticals right out from under me. Wildman the white knight.	I remember that deal. You were involved?

1 Got him at an auction in Kentucky.	How much?
2 Close to two million.  But this sucker can go all the way to Devon and the nationals.

1 Gordon, it's two minutes to close. What do you want to do?! Decide.	Dump it.

1 You know, the elevator man couldn't believe I paid $300,000 to have my walls looking like this, he's got them for free in Brooklyn.	I'll bet he's got an opinion on the stock market too. This apartment is already ahead of its time. I call it the "demolished" look. They've already heard about it at House and Garden and they're coming next week to photograph it before it gets... lived in. Is that alright? I'd love to have it in my portfolio.
2 Sure... But your fee... considering you're way over budget, should be negotiable.

1 You may not believe this Bud but I really do care for you. I think we could've made a good team...but that's how it goes...	Get the hell out!

1 I thought this was an informal meeting. What's he doing here?	Harold, you don't mind strolling around the block a couple hundred times, do you?

1 You must be wearing a mask you're laughing so hard behind it Larry. Let's cut the "sir" crap. Correct me if I'm wrong, but when you took CNX Electronics, you laid off 8,000 workers, Jessmon Fruit about 6,000, that airline...	I could break you, mate, in two pieces over my knees, you know it, I know it, I could buy you six times ever, I could dump the stock just to burn your ass but I happen to want the company and I want your block of shares. I'm announcing a tender offer at 65 tomorrow, and I'm expecting your commitment.

1 Anybody want another drink?	It's eleven forty-five let's go

1 Jenkins.  Can I get you some help?	Too late for that sir.  Give my love to the misses.  Get those bastards!

1 If my mother caught me up here she'd kill me.	Who's is all this?

1 Well?	Well divide 18 into three
2 Six six and six

1 That was very good.	Mom, I'm sorry.  I wanted to tell you. But it never felt right.
2 Why?

1 These are good.	Mm-hmm.

1 Of course.  You must be so proud.	I am.
2 Everyone's very anxious to shake hands with our newest academic celebrity.

1 Hello?	I'm not...

1 Love.	What?
2 Have you ever felt so completely consumed by a feeling for someone that you couldn't breathe?  That the time together is so passionate and consuming that you felt physical pain when they would leave?	Um...sure.
3 I couldn't catch my breath.  That's not a metaphor, that's...And I panicked.  I never dreamed anyone would hear me back there...  I tried to leave him.  Went to my mother's in Boston.  He brought my things up and pleaded with me to come home.

1 What was her major?	Biology.  She wanted to be a doctor.

1 Someone's there.	What?
2 In the window.  Norman's at work.	I don't...

1 Does Norman know?	Jody, she's alive.
2 What?	Mrs. Feur.  She's alive.  I met her. She's really sweet.
3 Then what was it?	Nothing.  It wasn't anything.  I've been on edge lately.  Maybe since the accident. And I'd prefer, I really would, to just--
4 Something was there.  You saw it.	Did I?
5 Yes.  Now I talked to Sela and there's a guy, this Pakistani guy down in Hartford...	Hartford?
6 And he's the real thing.  Specializes in cases like this, like yours.	No.  Jody, listen to me.  You have to listen to me.  This is not something that I can do right now.  Whatever it was, it's gone.  I need it to be gone now.
7 But Claire--	Please.

1 But he acted like he'd never heard of it.	Did he say that?
2 Jody he was lying.	What if he was?  Do you think he wanted to bring that up again just when you're trying to make a new start?
3 I guess not.	He's trying to put it behind him, Claire. You should too.

1 Excellent.  Couple of Swedish sailor cells just gang divided a virginal cheerleader cell.	Nice.  Almost done.

1 Of what?	Of him I think.
2 Did she say that?	More or less.

1 What do you mean?  Some noises where?	In the house.  I was scared.
2 Did you call the police?	No.  Can you drive me home?  I'll bring you back in the morning.
3 Of course.

1 Our house.	No.  Look!  In the window.

1 Are you lonely?	No!  And I don't need a psychiatrist!

1 You know I am.	Good.  You sat in front...I saw you there...

1 "You know..."	What?

1 The leaves...	Incredible.  We should take a drive before they're gone.  Spend the night at some cozy little bed and breakfast.
2 Look for antiques...	Yep.  There's some great places nearby.
3 Adamant.	What?
4 Little village down seven.  Supposed to be charming.	Huh.
5 Do you know it?	Don't think so.
6 Maybe we can stop there for lunch.

1 Lasher will act, Rowan.  Whatever it is he wants - he's waited three hundred years to have it.   facing him alone...  I don't like -	Lasher is my legacy - not Michael's.   Aaron, I've seen the pain in Michael.  I can't bear to see anymore.   He's not to know.  Swear to me.

1 No scaredy-cats in the Talamasca, huh...?	There is a difference between sensing danger - and being afraid.  what defines you in the landscape, Michael...?  what anchors your life...? Your work...?  Your creativity...?
2 Rowan.	Then focus on how you feel about her. Because your feelings define you.   Take off your gloves, Michael.

1 You two sees like a perfect fit.   Only two mounths...?	Mm-hmm.    Seems & lot longer.
2 In the bayou, they have a saying... 'You choose the music for the dance - but fortune picks your partner.'   Darling, I'd say you're on a roll.

1 You came.    I'm your Aunt Carlotta, my dear.	I want to see my mother.  Where is she...?
2 In the coffin, my dear.  where else...?

1 Did you like it...? Looking down at Graham and knowing what you could do...?	I'm NOT like you!  I'm NOT! You're cruel -

1 I am with you, my love. Like no other can ever be.	Nooo...  NO!  Stop!

1 I know that you're evil.	I only wanted to see as others do... feel as others do...  ...but Marguerite could not help me.  Nor Julien...
2 And now you expect me to stockpile corpses for you...?!	No, my love.  I want nothing more of the dead.  I want you to --- chang me.

1 Rowan and I will be together now. My time has come.  Your time is gone.	No!   Don't!  Lasher!!!

1 Just one.  The bar's closed.	The one time I want it to work...
2 You know - doors and keyholes are common signposts in out-of-body -	You're not gonna give me the textbook analysia, are you doctor...? My vision was just the chemical reaction of an oxygen-starved brain - and nobody -
3 No. I'm not.  Doctors should be the first ones to admit utter ignorance about some things.

1 you touched him --- and saw him...? What was he doinging.  Kinky...?	It's come to that, huh...?  Three weeks - and you need a psychic skin flick to perk up our sex life...?

1 Michael - I have to go - to New Orleans. I'll - I'll call yati when I -	What about you coming down here...?

1 What about your work back home...?	They need doctors in New Orleans too.   Michael - think what I could do with the money!

1 Aren't we supposed to love somebody for their moral rectitude or their courage or their beneficence -	Their what...?
2 So how come I love you most when you stick your finger in your chin...?

1 Michael - what made you fall in love with me...?	Your beneficence.
2 I'm serious.    Whatever it was - it's still there inside me, isn't it - change and all...?

1 I can't.	That's not good enough.  Why not...?!
2 I can't leave now.  Don't ask me to explain!  I just can't!

1 I'm getting --- left behind.	Left behind...?  This about Rowan...?
2 Yes.   Partly.  It's - it's -  Stu - do you believe in ---

1 OH MY GAWD!	I'm sorry - I didn't think
2 A person could get killed round here just for working late

1 I shouldn't say this - but you really remind me of someone I know	Oh really - you must remember me from when I was a regular customer.
2 I wasn't a manager here then MRS STECKLER - don't you remember?	I'm terribly sorry - I have a bad memory...

1 So what do you do?	I'm a dentist
2 And how long have you been a dentist?

1 My mother...?  I never knew my real MOTHER - I was adopted	Tell me about your adopted MOTHER

1 Where are you going?	Out - I may be some time

1 I don't want either of us to come to any harm - please...	You killed my friend!

1 What brings the rats out of the sewers?	I'm here about the so called disappearance of your husband - It's best if we let old bones lie. Know what I mean?  I'm working on the WHITE ANGEL case now - and I've got to check all known murderers or suspected murderers for the last five years... And that means you...So where were you last THURSDAY afternoon around five...
2 You think I'm the WHITE ANGEL?

1 Good - I've got to dash -  Say that I said hello to ELLEN for me would you...	Yes - of course.

1 Someday, I'll find out.	You have a better chance of being hit by a Mack truck with a refrigerated cargo bed full of sirloin tip.

1 This is like my every wet dream come true.  I don't even care that you're here, too, bro.	Be cool. Fake it if you have to.

1 Oh, how inappropriate is that!	Take a whiff of heaven.
2 How would you like it if I did that to your mother's panties?	I'd call you a sick, twisted fuck. But this is different.  She wasn't your mother mother--
3 Give me those!

1 Never say never.	Oh, god.  Look. Look.

1 I thought I'd be nervous, but you sure know how to make a girl feel relaxed, Teddy Bear.	I do? I mean, yeah, I do.
2 I have to admit, I am so totally turned on. We should do it. Now.	Do it?
3 You know...take the pictures?

1 You have to understand. This was a big shock, for all of us. One minute you're our little boy, of whom we could not be more proud. The next minute you're the owner of this whole pornographic empire.	But that doesn't make you the boss of everything, son.
2 Don't you see how your self involvement and lack of humility are affecting the whole family?

1 Sorry I--	It's okay. You need me?
2 Your mom said you've been ignoring your chores.

1 Who exactly ARE you?	What do you mean? I'm Ted Nelson.
2 And who IS Ted Nelson?

1 No problem, consider it done.  I had this idea of shooting on location. Outdoors, you know? Maybe at some famous Xenia landmarks. You think that would be a problem?	We'll send you the release forms, Ted. Our staffers will help in any way they can.

1 If you could just sign right there.	You want it in writing?
2 Just a formality.

1 What is it, William Randolph? Your balls need scratching?	Your article sucked.
2 In what sense?	In the sense that there is no "hidden agenda" behind a bake sale that raised five hundred dollars for seeing eye dogs.
3 Ah ha! It was so well hidden, you didn't even know it was there.	Come on, Julie. Don't screw up. You have some real talent.
4 Just because someone died and made you king of the publishing world doesn't mean you're even one ounce smarter than you were a week ago.	I'm trying to help.
5 I'm still better than you. Nothing changed except the decimal point in your savings account.	That's not ENTIRELY true.

1 I can't believe your dad built this for you.	He didn't. He had it built.
2 Whatever.	Not "whatever."  It's two different things.
3 He cared enough to want you to have it.	He phoned it in.
4 I see.	I doubt it.
5 Now it makes sense, the whole neo Bohemian, down with hypocrisy, fight the power crap. You're a poor little rich girl.	The ozone must be fully depleted on Planet Ted.
6 You think my dad would have been like that if I knew him? You think he would have bought me a stadium, instead of teaching me how to play ball?	Your dad taught you everything.
7 I mean my father.	A father is nothing but sperm, Ted. It takes a real man to be a dad.
8 It's all so complicated.	It's incredibly simple.
9 I feel like I'm being drawn and quartered. Like every part of me is being pushed and pulled and tugged in a different direction.	Eventually you'll let go.
10 And then what?	Then you'll see who's really holding on to you.
11 You're amazing.	I know.
12 Even when you infuriate me, I still want to kiss you.	But you never do.
13 If we were a team, we could do anything. I mean, anything.

1 Julie, wow. I was afraid you left. I was afraid I'd never see you again.	I'm not going anywhere, Ted. You're the one with the champagne wishes and caviar dreams.
2 I decided to let Helen run the magazine. I need to go to college, learn a few things, you know.

1 Oh, good lord. Are those Neptunes?	Only the best for my mother.
2 You promise you'll finish school?	I'll make you very proud.

1 You kicked us off your turf, Merk. Don't rain on our parade.	Mr. Nelson, you disappoint me. First you break our school board rules. Then you break the law.
2 What law, Merk? Having fun? Letting down our hair on prom night?	Our state has a zero tolerance policy for underage drinking.
3 You called the cops on us?	Alcohol does horrible things to a developing young mind.

1 You're the Sultan of Semen. The Monarch of Masturbation. The Merchant Prince of Lust. You. Ted. Are the King of Coitus.	Me? The King of Coitus?
2 The Supreme Sovereign of Sexuality.	Whoa. But...that's the thing...  I've never even actually...
3 Why, look who's here.

1 I loved my brother. I stood by his wishes to let his son run the company. A son he never knew. A son that he and his wife gave away at birth. A son who was raised in a world quite different from our own. Nevertheless, I was there for the lad. I guided him as best I could. But he's only seventeen, with a mind of his own and judgment that is, well, frankly, not a chip off the old block. There is only one clear solution...  And I think we all know what that is--	--PEACHES! CANNED PEACHES!

1 All I can tell you Sam, is hang in there.  They clear you of this mess, you get reinstated, with back pay...	That's great.  I'll just tell my creditors I'm not a rapist.  No problem... Shit.  I can't believe the board's going to act without even hearing my side of it.
2 The Van Ryan family created Blue Bay. They built the school... Sandra Van Ryan calls up the board and says kiss my ass, they say, left, right, or in the middle.  You're gonna need some help on this one, Sam.  You're gonna need a lawyer, and he'd better be a good one.

1 Got sort of hung up on her, from what hear.	She still work there?
2 No.  Not after that night.  I don't know what happened.  Maybe he caught her with some john... All I know is, the next morning the girl was gone and there was a dead boy... Indian kid named Davy.  Used to live down the road there in a wrecked car. Him and Suzie were at the Glades that night.  It was right after that, Ray got Suzie busted and sent her away.  That's what there is to say about Ray Duquette.	Was there ever any kind of investigation...

1 Isn't that against the law, peeking into windows?	Suzie Toller is missing.

1 You remember that little girl walked out of our talk at Blue Bay?	The skinny brunette.
2 This is where she lives.  She wants to talk.  Beats the shit out of me why she would call me at all.  I busted her once for possession.  she wound up doing about six months at Camp Nine.	You mean Camp Sixty-Nine.

1 We all have...	I mean something bad, Gloria, something bad you saw coning, and you didn't do anything, and then it happened.  I did that once.  I don't want to do it again.

1 That bothers you?	Yeah, maybe, a little.
2 Why is that?

1 Are you crazy, Ray?	You heard Kelly say "Sam."  That was Lombardo on the phone.  And you saw the girls...
2 Ray.  The conversation on this tape is totally unintelligible.  What we have here, is you on the Van Ryan property, without a proper warrant, shooting a porn flick...	I don't believe I'm hearing this.  A month ago you were pulling these two apart at the courthouse.  They were acting.  They were all acting, from the beginning.  And we bought it, hook, line and sinker... And now they're home free with six million of Sandra Van Ryan's money.

1 Ms. Toller?	I said he did.
2 Ms. Toller.  I'm asking you now, under oath, did Samuel Lonbardo rape you?

1 I can't believe you called Sam.  What's the matter with you?	I'm scared, that's what.  I'm scared there's no one to trust.
2 You can trust me.

1 Get off my property.	I'm not on your property!

1 Don't forget the car wash.	I won't.

1 The only way we're gonna blow this now, is if we do it ourselves...	Do it to ourselves?
2 We have to stick with the plan.	Stick?

1 Good thinking.	You can tie whoever did it to Sandra Van Ryan...
2 Forget it.	Lady has some deep pockets.  That's all I'm saying.
3 I know how deep her pockets are, Ken.  I thought I might be able to save my fucking house with an equity loan. Guess who's on the board of directors at the bank?

1 No.	Will they?
2 It doesn't look like it.	Then he'll be back at Blue Balls?

1 But she ran away.	That's right.

1 But I..	Shut up.  Don't fall apart.  The only people who can blow this is us. Remember?

1 I can't, Sandy.  I've got to run.	I'll bet.  Look, Sam.  Why don't you come by this weekend.  We'll take the boat out...
2 Sorry, Sandy.  I've got plans.	What?  Running over alligators with that silly swamp jalopy when you could be sailing a real boat...
3 Swamp's where it's at, Sandy.  Gives you a look into the muck we all crawled out of.  You ought to try it some time.

1 Attractive buttons, yes?  But yank one off, toss it, and poof!  It emits a cloud of sleeping gas.	You need that real often?
2 Always hoping.  Or this...	No offense, but all I ever need...  Are these...  And this.
3 Good Lord, man.  The world is changing.  And mark me, it is always the criminal mind that is the first to exploit modern invention.  We, as defenders of the right, must keep pace!	All right, if it'll make you happy, I'll try that.
4 Try what?

1 You feeling all right?	Come on, Jim.  I'm serious.  Dot...  Dash.  It'll be our secret means of communication should we ever need it.

1 So... what happened?	Those kids, they took my wagon. Never got it back.
2 Uh... how long ago was this?	I was six.  And ever since, my policy is: Act first and worry later.

1 Willard...	It's not a guy...
2 It's a town!

1 It was in your book.	Well, hell, maybe we do have a chance.

1 You didn't tell us you had this on!	My Lord, he was telling the truth!

1 Oh, don't worry.  I've already overlooked the fact your name's not actually on our guest list.	Well, I owe you one, don't I?
2 You most certainly do.

1 Doyle's the name, sir.  Of the Connemara Doyles.  And there's not a man riding the rails who holds a candle to meself.  That having been said, sir, you're five minutes late so let's be on our way!  Your friend's already aboard.	My friend?

1 ... well, of course you can.  Mr. President, what a surprise.  What brings you here?	On my way to Denver...

1 You got that right.  Now get up. We're walking out of here.	Has it penetrated that adrenaline- addled skull that you are surrounded by seventy-eight of my loyal followers?  You are in my domain!
2 Has it penetrated yours that I'm holding a gun on their leader?

1 This is something.	It's a smelting retort.

1 It's you they're after, Madmarti- gan.  What did you do this time?	They're not after me.  They want the baby.

1 Why can't you do it?  You have mag- ical powers.	My prsence cannot extend beyond this forest.  But I can give you these...

1 Mmmm, I love the smell of a woman.	My step-father's going to tear you apart.

1 We're a tiny version of all that?	As above, so below.

1 What's that?  I hear something!	You hear trouble.
2 What is it?

1 Because she's sick.	Because she's sick.

1 She said lots of thing.s	Willow!

1 Dada, what's a daikini?	Daikinis are giant people who live far far away.
2 Are you scared?

1 How am I gonna do that?	Patience.  Concentrate.  You will find a way.

1 How??	Use the philosopher's stone!  Hur- ry!  Invocation!  Release them!

1 Are you sure?	Yes!  Raziel!  She lives out on that island!

1 This is not going well.	Hurry!  Queen Cherlindrea will know what to do.

1 How could you do this to me tonight? I told you I had company	Sorry. It's important.

1 I saw him.	Who'd you see?

1 Last guy I would have figured. But he's part of it.	I hope you don't have any doubts about that.
2 If I did, I'd have kept my mouth shut...  It fits, Paul... Fifty-five gallons of P2P confiscated four years ago... Guess who was in on the collar? Mac.  He salts it away somewhere... he knows the stuff is potent, but the street chemists haven't figured out how to process it. But they do now.  And now the stuff is worth five-grand a pint and there are a lot of pints in a fifty-five gallon drum.	Who else knows?
3 Just us.	Okay, what are you going to need to clean it up
4 More people... Gotta pick up where Zenovich left off. People from outside the department.	Maybe the Bureau. Or those bastards at Treasury. I'll take care of it.  I hate this shit, Johnny. You cut their balls off for me. I'm counting on you.

1 Whacking?	Yes. And I also want to leave this city.
2 Believe me, I'm trying to get this over with as fast as I can. But Samuel will probably have to come back and testify.	We do not go into your courts.
3 People who don't go into our courts when they're told to sometimes go directly into our jail.

1 But John... why didn't you go to a hospital?	No, no doctor...
2 But why?	Gunshot... they'll file reports... they'll find me.
3 But 

1 The... bullets?	Oh. The bullets.

1 I got there late, John.	Let's just find Coalmine.  Listen, Zenovich made a mistake. You didn't let anybody down. It happens 
2 It won't happen again.

1 Elaine, I've come to apologize for Lt. McElroy. He overstated the department's position.	He accused John of taking kickbacks. And you know  anybody who knows John  knows that's a goddamn lie!
2 Of course, Elaine. But as long as there's any question, better Johnny should come back and clear his name.	Better you should get off my front porch before I get my mace!
3 Elaine, I don't want to have to take you in for questioning. You've got his car, you were the last to see him 	I don't know where he is.
4 But... if you had to guess?

1 How can this be? How can you do such a thing? Is this plain? Is this the ordnung?	I have done nothing against the ordnung.
2 Eh? Nothing? Rachel, you bring this man to our house. With his gun of the hand. You bring fear to this house. Fear of English with guns coming after. You bring blood and whispers of more blood. Now English music... and you are dancing to English music! And you call this nothing?	I have committed no sin.
3 No sin? Maybe. Not yet. But, Rachel, it does not look...  Don't you know there has been talk? Talk about you, not him. Talk about going to the Bishop. About having you... shunned!	That is idle talk.
4 Do not make light of it, Rachel. They can do it... quick! Like that! And then... then I can not sit at table with you. I can not take a thing from your hand. I... I can not go with you to meeting!  Rachel, good Rachel, you must not go too far! Dear child!

1 Get back in there.	My son is out there!
2 Nobody's going to hurt your son...

1 Oh, we dream lots of silly things when we --	No, Aunt Em -- this was a real, truly live place.  And I remember that some of it wasn't very nice....

1 ...resourceful!	Yes, sir.  So we'd like you to keep your promise to us, if you please, sir.
2 Not so fast!  Not....

1 What are you going to do with my dog?  Give him back to me!	All in good time, my little pretty -- all in good time.
2 Oh, please give me back my dog!	Certainly -- certainly -- when you give me those slippers.
3 But the Good Witch of the North told me not to.	Very well! Throw that basket in the river and drown him!

1 ...Toto, too?	Toto, too.
2 Oh, now?	Whenever you wish.
3 Oh, dear -- that's too wonderful to be true! Oh, it's -- it's going to be so hard to say goodbye.  I love you all, too.  Goodbye, Tin Man.  Oh, don't cry.  You'll rust so dreadfully.  Here -- here's your oil-can. Goodbye.

1 I had the measles once -- and she stayed right by me every minute.	Uh-huh.
2 What's she doing now?

1 Where do you want to be oiled first?	My mouth -- my mouth!

1 We might.	Oh --

1 ...yes.	Look -- it ticks!

1 Ho -- ho --ho -- ho	Hah!

1 As Monarch of the Forest I don't like the situation.	Are you gonna stand around And let 'em fill us full of horror?
2 I'd like to roar 'em down -- But I think I lost my roarer.

1 ...yes.	Ohhhh --
2 Ohh!

1 But you've just been saying how much you want a heart.	And I'll keep the oil-can handy.

1 Oh --	Looks like we came a long way for nothing.
2 Oh -- and I was so happy!  I thought I was on my way home!

1 ...excellence to the Miracle Wonderland Carnival Company -- until one day, while performing spectacular feats of stratospheric skill never before attempted by civilized man, an unfortunate phenomena occurred. The balloon failed to return to the fair.	It did?

1 Stop pushing!	Oh - I was only trying to help. Ohhh!

1 Now, let' s see -- this goes -- Oh, I wish I were better at puzzles.	Wait a minute. This is the left one. He walks bad enough already.
2 Oh, poor Dorothy. We may never see her again.

1 ...junk!	Ohhhh -- yes...yes, sir -- Y-Yes, your Honor.  You see, a while back, we were walking down the Yellow Brick Road, and --
2 Quiet!	Ohhhhhh!

1 Oh!  Oh, come on, come on!	Look -- you can see it here.  It's wonderful!
2 Emerald City!

1 Help! Help! Help! Help! Help!	Oh!  Well, what happened to you?
2 They tore my legs off, and they threw them over there! Then they took my chest out, and they threw it over there!	Well, that's you all over.

1 What about us?	Well, I --
2 What about the heart that you promised Tin Man --?	Well, I --
3 -- And the courage that you promised Cowardly Lion?	Well, I --

1 Shame you had to spot I wasnt the real thing.	So who are you?
2 Bond --

1 Hes sealed himself in.	Hes going to insert the plutonium.

1 Old friend?	Since Oxford. I knew him when he had nothing but a brilliant mind and enough guts to conquer the world. Hes a man of great integrity.
2 Who buys classified reports for three million pounds.

1 The report King bought. Its a manual. Renards men used it to remove this radio tracking device from the warhead.	Then Robert was right about a Russian connection.
2 Theyre getting their weapons from the Russians, but where are they getting the money to buy the weapons?  I cant help thinking...the person close to King, the one who switched that pin...	The inside man?
3 Is maybe...the inside woman.

1 Today, of all days, the sun decides to shine.	Perhaps Sir Robert had a word with the Man Upstairs.
2 A word? Im sure by now hes engineered a hostile takeover.	You knew him well?

1 No!  It will cave in!	Its the only way out...

1 You knew when you first saw me.  You knew it would be like this.	Shush.

1 So you killed your father.	He killed me! He killed me the day he refused to pay my ransom.

1 Really Bond, couldnt you find a nice Russian scientist with hair growing out of his ears?	Whats your business with Elektra King?
2 I thought you were the one in her business.	She dropped a million and half dollars to the House -- your House. And you didnt even bat an eyelid.  She was paying you off.  What for?
3 As ever you are the spy who has to see a plot wherever he looks.

1 What is this place?	Former KGB surveillance post. The Dye Factory was just a front; now it turns a good profit.

1 This is the end.	No.  It is the beginning. The world will never be the same.

1 As you can see, we may be able to salvage a good-sized chunk of the farm belt.	What about the aftermath?  This so-called . . . "nuclear winter" theory?
2 We don't really know, sir, but bluntly, our survival capability . . . may depend on a quirk of the weather.	The weather.  I see.  Keep me posted.  I want hourly forecasts and a full report on optimum strike conditions.

1 Rorschach's on the case.  He's got Dreiberg in a lather.  He seems to think that someone is "stalking" the Watchmen.	Oh?  The CTU suspects a Libyan hit squad.
2 What's your theory?	Life and death are unquantifiable abstracts.  They don't concern me.

1 Jon -- there's something I have to know.  Did you love me once?	Yes, I loved you.  I left the earth when I lost you.
2 Yet you must've known all along that you'd give me cancer.  Just be being with me.	I didn't give you cancer, Laurie.  Not you, not the others.  I don't know what did.
3 But you knew that I'd -- die.	Memories of the future are just like any others.  I've tried not to dwell on the unpleasant ones . . .  You won't die of cancer, Laurie.  There won't be time for that.

1 I know, I know, it's just -- he's back on the street, he smells blood.	You know how he is.  He goes on these binges, kills a couple of thugs -- then he's satisfied.  It blows over.
2 He's bound to get caught.  I don't want my name coming out.  Not at this late date.	If he comes here, I'll handle him.  Remember -- I've always protected you.  Haven't I?  Do you need money?
3 No.  I just wanted you to --	You did the right thing, Daniel.  Let's stay in touch, okay?  Good night.
4 Good night.

1 Damn straight.	Damn straight!  We were heroes.
2 Of course, we looked like idiots in those bondage outfits.	Well, that was Adrian's idea.  I know he's the smartest man in the world and all that, but -- talk about publicity hounds . . .
3 Hey.  You remember that nut in the hockey mask?  With the asthma? What was his name . . .	Oh yeah.  The one that used to confess to everything?  Hoping we'd beat him up?
4 That's the one.  Whatever happened to him?	He pulled it on Rorschach . . . and Rorschach dropped him down an elevator shaft.

1 Ohh.  I could use some dinner.  Who was that on the phone?	One more down.  Someone tried to kill Adrian.  . . . First time I've ever heard him scared.

1 Missed 'em Dan.  You're aiming high!	I don't want to take 'em out.  Just want to keep 'em interested.
2 They're practically on us . . .	That Detroit shit?  I'm so worried.

1 Dan -- what do we do now?	Wherever we are, it's better than what we left.  Backs together --
2 We'll tell them what's happened.  They'll listen to reason, won't they -- ?

1 We're running, Rorschach.  We've got no place to go.  We're hightailing it down to Adrian's.	Veidt's assassin.  Leads to follow.  Can't just --
2 Cases, leads -- they don't matter, Rorschach.  The world's about to end.  If someone is trying to kill us, it doesn't matter.	Coward.  Giving up.
3 SHUT UP, Rorschach.

1 No comment.	Did you know he was back on the streets?
2 I did not.  Now get out of my way!	Isn't it true that you --

1 I don't know who you are buddy, but I swear to God, you got the wrong guy.	Edgar William Jacobi, aka William Edgar Bright, a.k.a. Moloch.
2 You're making a big --

1 Most guys we ran through this either took off or helped them rob the place. I expected you to do the same.	That shows me already that you don't have a clue. What's it to you, anyway?
2 Whether you thought this was for real or not, you jumped in and helped the waitress on instinct. That tells me something about your character.	Good for you. Now why don't you stop wasting my time and tell me what you want. You didn't go through all this for my benefit.
3 It's your lucky day. You just might get the chance to pay back our wonderful country for all the freedom you enjoy.	A Fed, I shoulda known. Who else would have this kind of budget? Now you're gonna hit me with the sales pitch.
4 Alright, Cage, you've got me. This is one of those moments. "Many are called, few are chosen", that kind of thing. Your government needs you. Are you up for the challenge?	..If you're trolling around for narcs, man, have you got the wrong guy.
5 Why is that?	Look at me, dude, do I look like a fan of law enforcement? Forget the tests, you shoulda just asked me. I woulda saved you a lot of trouble.
6 Oh I don't know, I think the tests work pretty well. Sometimes they give me answers you wouldn't admit to in a million years.	Are we done now? You've got nothing on me. So if you ain't booking me, I'm walking.
7 You've got this wrong. You're not under arrest, you've been abducted. And until I say different, you belong to me.	Is that a fact?
8 Sure as gravity. I've had a feeling about you from the start, Cage. It's nausea.	You know what I hate? Any scumbag with a clean shirt and a bad haircut can get one of those tin stars and suddenly they think they're God.
9 You know what I hate? It's always the assholes that pass the tests.

1 You did say "Ahab"? You're sure about that?	Yeah, I sent you pictures. Here's what I'm thinking. If they take out the cameras and sensors, they could probably put a bomb in this thing. You drop it in the water in the Red Sea and three weeks later it's swimming up the Potomac.
2 This is good work, X, damn fine work. You need to press on at all costs, find out what they have planned with this "Ahab".	Hey, one miracle at a time. They're on to me now, remember?
3 I'm gonna be en route with a team shortly to relieve you. Just keep the pressure on until the cavalry arrives. And X? You done yourself proud helping those people today.

1 Whatchu doing here?	Oh, I don't know. It was an accident.
2 That's some accident, hombre. You accidentally fall out of a plane in the middle of the night and land up in my back yard.

1 If you got a problem with me, why are we dancing?	Yorgi asked me to.
2 You do everything Yorgi says?	Go to hell.
3 It's gonna be like that, huh? You got all bent out of shape as soon as he started dancing with someone else. Why's that?	Mind your business.
4 Did you guys used to date? That's it, right? He broke your heart and you're still soft on him. That's funny, it don't seem to fit with a tough broad like you.

1 I can't let this happen. I want you to go out the back. I'll make up some excuse.	They'll kill you, you know they will. Besides, there is no back door. Keep smiling. Ready? Now.

1 Where's he headed?	He owns a big industrial complex on the river. He'll launch it from there.

1 What was that for?	I'd forgotten how exciting it is working together.
2 You've been so quiet lately, Petra, I thought you no longer cared.	Why don't we go below decks and work off some of this adrenaline.
3 Viktor! Stay the course.

1 French Polynesia? This wouldn't last us a week in a cheap hotel. Do you know how expensive it is down there?	Alright, so I'll get more.
2 It's not about the money, X! You never plan for anything. I can't live like that anymore, I need some stability.	Well if you're bailing, I guess I'd better give you your surprise now.

1 Heads up, man. What's this thing on my back?	A parachute. This does not argue well.

1 Very nice. I'm impressed.	I'm somewhat less so. We seem to have a bit of a problem...

1 That was for Anders.	Don't forget goatee boy. I greased him up on the diamond run.

1 Scott.. I -	I don't like him being here.
2 What are you talking about?	You saw what happened tonight.  You think Magneto won't come after him again.  You think he won't come here if necessary.  This is a school, for God's sake.
3 If Magneto is planning to use Logan for some terrible purpose it's our responsibility to do something.

1 I've served with men like you before. Methodical.  Systematic -- Naive.  You know what happens to those men in a real fight?	You know, you --
2 Shut up.  I got no interest in you, Xavier,  or your... X-Men.

1 Ms. Grey -- you work at a school for mutants in Westchester, New York.  Can you tell the members of this committee what exactly you are teaching these mutants?	Math.  History.  Science.  English. Athletics --
2 You wouldn't happen to be teaching them how to use their powers to --	Control, Senator...  we teach them control.

1 Where am I?	You're backstage at the encore of creation.

1 Don't you knock?	They're all asking how you're doing. Are you feeling up to saying hello to everyone?
2 Actually I'm feeling up to leaving.

1 This checkmate goes to you.  I didn't want to hurt anyone.  But you leave me no choice.	WHAT DO YOU MEAN TO DO?

1 Give him an extra dollar.	Yes, sir.

1 Still happy you married me?	MMmmm.
2 Love me oodles and oodles?	MMmmm.
3 So this is what it's like to be completely happy!	MMmmm.

1 What a strange fellow.	Yes, he's a little bit... tilted. Harmless, though.
2 Why does he call you 'master'?

1 Well... we'll see.	Will there be anything else?
2 I don't think so.  Is my assistant taken care of?	I put her in the guest room, just down the hall.
3 Good.

1 In conclusion... it should be noted that more than common injury to the nerve roots is always serious, because... once a nerve fibber is severed... there is no way to regenerate life back into it.  Are there any more questions before we leave?	Dr. Fronkonsteen!
2 Yes?

1 There.	I beg your pardon?
2 There wolf!  There castle!	Why are you talking like that?
3 I thought you wanted to.	No.

1 Taking the book along?	Yes, I think we could all use a good laugh.

1 You can't win 'em all.	But there must be a reason. This is science, not art.

1 What's the point of my setup? It's not funny unless you repeat exactly what you said.	I'm not trying to be funny.

1 Come on, big fellow!	Is everything ready?
2 Yes, master.  Are you sure you want to go through with it?	It's the only way.
3 Okay, boss!  But I hope you know what you're doing.

1 What's that tune that you're playing	Zis is an old Transylvanian Lullaby.
2 How sweet!  Such a quaint little tune.

1 Dr. Fronkonsteen -- look!	Whatever it is, it's coming from down there.  I'm going down to see.
2 Let me come with you, Doctor, please!  I don't want to stay up here alone.	All right then, quietly!  Close your robe and stay right behind me. Don't make a sound!

1 It looks that way.	What do you think we should do?

1 It's terrible -- the price society demands in the name of fidelity... ultimately?	Not fooling around.
2 I know, but I mean -- not fooling around physically?... Or not fooling around intellectually?	I see what you mean.
3 There can never... ever... be anything physical between us. You know that, dear.	I know Frederick.

1 Sweetheart.....Is this really you???	MMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!

1 Oh, must be around ten... ten-thirty.	Igor -- the clock!  Hurry!

1 Splendid horsemanship  Who are they?	Sikali Horse, My Lord. Christians alL I know each one by name.
2 They come well recommended do they? DURNFORD

1 Splendid site, Crealock, splendil I want to establish Camp here immediately.	Certainly, Sin
