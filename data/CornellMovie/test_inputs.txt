You have my word.  As a gentleman
do you listen to this crap?
Me.  This endless ...blonde babble. I'm like, boring myself.
Bianca, I don't think the highlights of dating Joey Dorsey are going to include door-opening and coat-holding.
I have the potential to smack the crap out of you if you don't get out of my way.
He said everyone was doing it.  So I did it.
Daddy, people expect me to be there!
That girl -- I --
Who is she?
Why not?
Number one.  She hates smokers
Her favorite uncle
Cameron, I'm a little busy
Leave my sister alone.
I don't know, Dorsey. ..the limo.-the flowers.  Another hundred for the tux --
So he has this huge raging fit about Sarah Lawrence and insists that I go to his male-dominated, puking frat boy, number one golf team school. I have no say at all.
William didn't even go to high school
You hate me don't you?
Then say you'll spend Dollar Night at the track with me.
Come on -- the ponies, the flat beer, you with money in your eyes, me with my hand on your ass...
Why'd you let him get to you?
Dorsey.
I know.  It'd have to be a pretty big deal to get you to mainline tequila. You don't seem like the type.
I thought you were above all that
He left!  I sprung the dickhead and he cruised on me.
How'd you get a tux at the last minute?
It's just something I had.  You know
Was that your sister?
What plan?
I missed you.
It was a bratwurst.  I was eating lunch.
Have a great time, honey!
If God intended our proximity to Asia, do you believe he would have waited for you to show it to the world?
I'm not asking you to swear to anything.
I want to go with you!
And were you never ambitious, Excellency?  Or is ambition only a virtue among the nobles, a fault for the rest of us?
Chief says -- how many?
You mustn't give way to despair. You must wait.
If God intends you to go, then you will go.
The ocean is uncrossable?
Don Moxica -- we all have to work.
... Into a monk...
Tell me about yourself.  What you did as a young boy... what your parents were like.
Your mother was blind?
Back in the Czech Republic?
Your father blamed you for your mother's blindness?
I came here.  I had no money.  I knew no one.  I couldn't get a job because you have to have a green card to get work. They approached me - I could've made a lot of money.  I considered it, but... it's not who I am.  They pay me below the table at Ludwig's.
What are you asking me?
Whether you tell us or not, we'll find out.  Better if it comes from you.
Did the D.A. videotape her deposition?
Alright.  Swing by her apartment.  Let her pick up her clothes and take her straight to Hoover Street.  You got that?
He got my gun!  Motherfucker was filming the whole time!
The Super said he'd seen her before but she didn't live here.
Hmmmm.
Why not?
Detective, does it look like a murder?
How many victims are up there?
Can we go up to the crime scene?
Is it drug related?
So we're waitin' to hit this warrant - we got Emergency Service with the heavy weapons standin' by - ready to go.  I say, lemme get a cigar outta the car.  I go to get the cigar and BOOM!  All the sudden I turn around and a kid with a shotgun let one go.  Right where I was standin'.  That coulda been it.  I coulda had my head blown off and for what?  Some stupid kid got panicky, takes the safety off and it's over.  If I hadn't gone back for that cigar - for a bad habit - I would've had my head blown off.
Come to 45 Broadway.  Don't bring the Police.  Come alone or you'll be in my next film.
No.  I'm the best that's ever threatened you.
We'll talk about that.  Four o'clock gives you time to go to bank.  Three hundred thousand dollars.
If you don't want my film - I'll call another show.  And they will show it.
Give me the address!!
Look.  Times Square.  Just like in the movies!
Why?  Why do I always have to speak to you in Czech?
What is it?
I did.
Why not?
Why did you leave that stuff in about you being the director?
Viewer discretion advised!
What was that?
The smoke'll permeate your nostrils - burn 'em out.  Let it run.
What are you gonna do?
Hi. Frank... coming in, please.
Okay. 
Hal?
I suppose it's because you've been under a lot of stress, but have you forgotten that they're not supposed to be revived for another three months.
Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation.
I'm at Space Station Five, darling. How are you?
How do you do, Mr. Miller?
Dr. Floyd, how long do you think this can be kept under wraps?
Hal, have pod arms secure the component.
Yeah.
Maybe you better have a Black Russian.
Hey, don't you think a hair stylists got any interest in gettin' it on?
Where's ganz?
I don't need to hear your jive. I already got that department taken care of...
Who'd you call on the phone back at the booking station?
I'm gonna enjoy this ... here, I'll even loan you my badge.
Just tell me about the money.
He's after your money.
You'd think the guy'd be smart enough to know he was being tailed.
If I was his size and had Ganz on my ass, I'd  just leave town.
Where's luther?
Hey, how'd my car get here?
Back to jail in my own car.  Ganz got away. Got all my money. It just don't seem right.
It's your money.  It'll be here in six months when you get out.
That's right. Not my style, Reggie..
No, you don't. If I ever get word of you steppin' over the line again, I'm gonna ventilate that suit of yours.
Where the Christ do you think you're going?
Bullshit red tape.
I'm all wet.
Look, spare me the macho bullshit about your gun...
Look, Jack, if you make everything your personal responsibility, you'll turn into a bad cop.  It's not a practical way to function...
Here it comes again ... the sacred job...
What makes you think they were lesbians, or as you so quaintly put it, dykes?
It might pay to reexamine a few of your more primitive notions.  I was in bed with a girlfriend watching TV last week, Jack, and one thing we know about me is I happen not to be a lesbian ... Now, if this Indian's girlfriend got upset when you came looking for him, it could just be she's still vulnerable to him.
When a guy hurts you, then comes back bleeding on his hands and knees, who knows, he might just be irrestible.
What do you want?  What's goin' on?
How you doing, man?
Ikset-kiba.  Me imanetaba oum dalat!
She's not my bride, she's my fare. She's looking for this Vito Cornelius. According to the phone guide he lives here.
There's no light! You told me there were supposed to be four beams of light.
And you don't know how they open, is that what you are saying?
Father.  You sure she's the Supreme Being?
She was taught to love the life of others... but not her own. You have to teach her to love if you want her to truly live!
Do you love her?
I don't have time... I need to know.
Daya deo dono Dato.  Dalutan!
Other than that... You all right?
...Hi.
Solid little jobs, aren't they?
Apipoulai!
Where you going?
At least I won lunch.
I managed to contact the Mondoshawan. They deplore the incident, but accept our apologies.
The-Stones weren't aboard the ship.
Drink!
You think you'll have time for the water heater this weekend?
You're not using the same guy who tried to fix it?
What are these?
I'll do this for you.  Fifteen thousand dollars.
Is that him?
What's he talking about?
Do it.
Do it!  Put me out of my misery so I don't have to listen to you whining anymore.  You think it's so easy?
I never killed anyone.
He's lying.
How old are you?
Where are your parents?
I don't mean any offense... but what are you doing mixed up in all this?
You just strike me as smart enough to be doing something else.
You're telling me it doesn't get to you?
What about me?
A daughter.
Look... that's awful generous and everything...
It's a film... of a girl being murdered.
Yes... ?
How... how can you say that to me...?
My husband never laid a hand on her. She would have told me... she would have told me...
Your son-in-law dealt with the dry cleaning franchise during the day, saw that woman every night.  The specifics are in the report, and information about the woman.  It's unpleasant, I know.  I apologize...
No, sir, he is not.
I heard you screaming.  Was it a bad one?
Doesn't the dream master work for you anymore?
You in a hurry?
I know.  I hardly have any time to study.
Alright, let's assume this whole thing is true. Why does Freddy all of a sudden need you?
I think Sheila's more interested in dissecting bodies than just admiring them.
I'm sorry honey, but...
Honey, we went over this in therapy.
In your present condition, Alice, we're worried about your ability --
Mommy...?
Dad!
Did everyone call everyone?
Are you alright?
Mark, are you okay?
I couldn't do that, Mark.  He's my last link with Dan...No, I want him.
Oh man!  I could've gone all night without looking at that.
It's okay.
However our ideas disagree, as I've said before, I'm <u>not</u> a coward!  And it happens you've got no choice:  Either <u>I</u> take you down there, in the Lungfish, or you don't get there -
You've got to let us try, Skipper --
Here - keep these.  It wants me to come alone.
We read you!  Go ahead, Doctor!  They're inside the saucer.  It's filled with breathable air!
Thought you were going to Washington, Skipper.
Straight to the Pole - at almost fifty knots!
My yeoman will show you to your quarters.
...if Jack told the truth, he could be free by the time he's my age.
You don't believe me?
I know he's due for the last two years. I was thinking of paying it when the insurance comes in.
Done much shooting with that rifle yet?
If you get it?
You might not kill it.
You might gut-shoot it or cripple it for somebody else to find and tag. Can't guarantee that won't happen, especially with a new gun. I may have to shoot it.
Mmm.
I get it.  No sweat. You'll get yourself a deer and you'll get him dead. And you'll have him by coffee time.
Bastard's got his high beams on.
Some party, huh? Sorry I lost sight of you. I had to step outside for a smoke. You find anybody you know here? There must be some kids you used to know from school. You want to go tomorrow? See your old teachers? Be more fun than hanging out with me all day.
No what?
You are home. There are lots of kids you still know here.
Jesus. Listen, Jill, tell you what. Tomorrow morning, you still want to go home, I'll drive you down. I'll get off work or something.
What? You called Mommy? Just now?
Jesus, why?
Come and get you! Shit! It's a damn half hour drive each way. Why didn't you talk to me about it first?
Yeah. Yeah, right, I'm mad. What'd you tell her, for Christ sake?
We're looking for the funniest costume! And the scariest! And the most imaginative! And the best costume of all!
What do I have to do for it?
I saw Mel Gordon in here this morning.
He say anything about the summons I tried to give him? Sonofabitch wouldn't accept it.
You? Why?
That was before Twombley was shot. Before he knew.
Want to buy?
I won't. You interested?
You and Mel Gordon?
New hat?  Jill's up, I see.
How's she doing?
Are you sure they're home? Did you call?
I said, 'Next time, phone ahead.'
What the hell are you talking about?
Moving violation! I just got out of bed and you're telling me you're giving me a goddamn speeding ticket? Now? Are you nuts? Is that it, Whitehouse? You're nuts?
Hold on!
You're talking about a goddamned ticket, from when I passed you at the school where you were deciding to hold up traffic while dreaming of becoming a traffic cop or something?
Doing your fucking job. I know. I watch television too.
What was that?  You got something to say, say it! Say it!
It'll come out Jack lied and the kid'll get hung for it.
Who?
No shit.
Well, it was an accident.
Then you accidentally see your body, or your face, or whatever, and you don't know who the hell it belongs to. Strange. It's the business with the old man, I know, and how incredibly pissed I was at him, and also chasing Jack Hewitt like that, and the Goddamned truck going through the ice, not to mention Margie's being so upset -- one thing on top of another.
Mom?
Daddy...
Mr. President, it's an honor. Now with your permission can we lead you the fuck out of here.
Put your pilot on.
Sir, you threw out page two.
It was a good ad-lib, sir.
Air Force One, this is AF-135-RA. We have been instructed to refuel your plane.
Please change course to Zero Seven Four and drop to eighteen thousand feet. Over.
Romeo Tango Zulu, do you have the President? Over.
Now, or he dies, please.
She isn't a part of this. This is between you and me.
Our KH-ll's took this one at 0100 hours. What you see here is the mobilization of two mechanized brigades.
You know what?
I miss you. And I miss her.
Did they say anything about my family?
It's bait.  Don't take it.
Twenty five minutes. They should be here any moment.
Did you feel that?
Felt like a large asteroid.
What is it, Mary?
Elaine.
Elaine.
Elaine, we have to go back.
Ted, the lever!
Have you got it straightened out now?
Request; comprehensive electrical systems check.
Request; life support systems check.
Request; self-analysis of ROK hardware and software systems regarding behavioral changes.
Which passenger is Joe Salucci?
He's carrying a bomb.
You're seeing bugs where they don't exist, Striker.
You're tired, Striker, overworked.  That wiring meets all the safety specifications.
Hello, I'm Paul Carey from the airline. I'm here to pick up Captain Kramer.
Can't you take a guess?
You can't take a guess for another two hours?
Elaine!
I came home early and found your note. I guess you meant for me to read it later. Elaine, I've got to talk to you.
I know things haven't been right for a long time, but it'll be different. If you'll just be patient, I can work things out.
Don't you feel anything for me at all any more?
I wish I could say the same for George Zipp.
See them, Elaine?
He's right on the heading.
Yes?
Well, the doctor will be with you in just a moment. One thing: do you know what he had for dinner?
Excuse me, sir. Would you like some coffee before we serve dinner?
He's not here.  Why ask me?
Kill them both.
What is this?
Matthew, you don't have to-- .
Yeah... I know the routine.
Was.  Divorced.
Well, let's roll, George.
Uh, George...
How do I look?
One of the two men was Hubley, right?  What about the other one? Did you know him?
Yeah, I heard of it.
Granger and Pitts are already on it.
Movement!
Can't lock up...
And it's too late to shut it down?
You read my deposition...it's complete and accurate.
I get the picture.
They're right under the primary heat exchangers.
That's not what I mean.  Gorman, if your men have to use their weapons in there, they'll rupture the cooling system.
What's he scanning for?
How do you feel?
Outstanding.  Then all we need's a deck of cards.  All right, let's move like we got a purpose.
They're in the approach corridor.
No!  No!  She's alive!  We have to --
Looks like it stung him.
Fifteen meters.
I was the best at the game. I knew the whole maze.
Yeah, you know.  In the walls, under the floor.  I was the ace.  I could hide better than anybody.
Burke!  Open the door!
How many colonists?
Oh - excuse me!
No, she's fine.
No! No! No!
Where?
Look, old man, you stay out of this. We spend a fortune on you, more than we can possibly afford, and all you do is criticize, morning to night. And then you think you can -
Excellency!
I do apologize for this afternoon. I behaved like a silly girl. Where shall we go?
Be careful!
What a strange young man.
Well, I'm glad to hear that.
Majesty!
Excuse me, but how old are you?
Well, what do you have for me today?
Yes, what about him?
Yes, Papa, name it. Name it. I'll do anything you say!
Oh, thank you, sir.
Not that I've seen.
Oh, yes, sir, all day long. He never leaves the house until evening. He just sits there, writing and writing. He doesn't even eat.
Oh, I wouldn't know that, sir.
Isn't he marvelous? He cost me a bundle, that horse, but he's worth it. I tell you, if you'd played Don Giovanni here it would have been a great success. I'm not joking. These people aren't fools. You could do something marvelous for them.
'Course you would. You belong here, my boy, not the snobby Court. You could do anything you felt like here - the more fantastic the better! That's what people want, you know: fantasy. You do a big production, fill it with beautiful magic tricks and you'll be absolutely free to do anything you want. Of course, you'd have to put a fire in it, because I've got the best fire machine in the city and a big flood - I can do you the finest water effects you ever saw in your life. Oh, and a few trick animals. You'd have to use those.
Herr Mozart. What a surprise. What can I do for you?
Well, your pupil is married and living in Mannheim, young man.
What is this, Mozart? What's the matter with you?
What for?
Well, this is hardly the way to go about it.
Nine performances! Nine! That's all it's had - and withdrawn.
But what is it they don't like?
What did you think of it yourself? Did you like it at all?
It's the best opera yet written. I know it! Why didn't they come?
I know, I know. Perhaps you should give me some lessons in that.
Oh no, the honour would be all mine.
Another? But that's too soon! Tomorrow night? It's impossible! Did he say a hundred?
Would you? Actually, you could.
But you'd have to swear not to tell a soul. I'm not allowed.
You know, it's all here in my head. It's just ready to be set down. But when I'm dizzy like this my eyes won't focus. I can't write.
That's wonderful!
What are you doing, Herr Director?
Well?
Well, Mozart is already rehearsing.
That lady is back, sir.
Oh dear girl, your extracurricular activities are of no consequence to me. I don't give a damn who you sleep with. I'm concerned about David.
It's a full moon. Where is he?
Aw come on, Miss Price!
Aw come on, Alex!
The kitchen.
Alex, I've lost my mind. I woke up at the zoo! But you know what? I feel terrific!
Waking up at the zoo, that's not so insane. Having no clothes on? That's insane. What did I do last night, Alex?
Hello, Benjamin.
No what?
Well, all right then, be that way. Here, swallow this.
Here, Gladys, Tom. Did you hear the one about the crashing plane?
There were witnesses?
How could there have been witnesses? It was so dark. We were running and I fell and Jack went to help me up and this thing came from nowhere... I don't understand what they're talking about.
Nice looking group.
Did you hear that?
It sounds far away.
What can I say, Jack?
Aren't you going to say, 'I told you so'?
You look awful.
I didn't mean it. I don't know what I'm saying. I'm not even sure it was me who killed those people. I don't remember doing it.
Well, even if I'm not the wolfman, I am crazy enough to do something like that. I mean, here I sit in Leicester Square talking to a corpse. I'm glad to see you, Jack.
Excuse me.  Yes?
What here?
Hello, Tom.
Where you been?
Character, hmmpf! That's your idea?
That is simple, isn't it? I assume you can prove that if necessary.
Looks like you're going to have no trouble at all. What was the lady's name, Mr. Cluett?
Oh!
Then what did you want to gamble for? If you'd have beat us out of fifty G's, you'd have been paid, wouldn't you? Well, we want our dough.
That don't do us any good.
But I'm giving a party for him - a real, old-fashioned surprise party. Caps, bells, whistles, and everything. I'm really terribly excited about it. I've been planning it for months.
Well, what?
You? No can do. It's all set. Just a few of Tom's closest friends.
Don't be silly, Cyril. These are respectable people. They'd probably bore you to death.
Why are you so anxious?
No.
I'm not interested in what you think.
I tell you, I'm not interested in your opinion.
Ho! Ho! Ho!
Listen, don't go around being attractive to anyone but me . . .
Don't you forget that I'm still the head man around here too. Now we'll get the tickets changed for tomorrow night. You and I are going out together. How's that?
Oh!
It's all right. Thanks.
What time did this thing happen?
All right. If the boy proves an alibi, he's all right, isn't he?
They've been coming in steady all morning. I have called for some extra police.
Hello, Helen!
Why?
Shh . . . !  I'll wait for you upstairs.
Yes, I guess it was one, 'cause...
No. It wasn't earlier because...
No - because me clock struck four, and when it strikes four, it's one.
Certainly, Mr. Jones! Certainly! Charlie!
Our place, Clell Miller's, Sammy Johnston, the Creeders. Will Hite.
Things changed when you quit the gang. For example, I'm now the one who says "Let's ride."
You have no shame.
You shut up now, boy.
Because we were good at it?  Hell, we were great at it. Jesse, don't tell anyone I said this, because everybody knows I'm the toughest man in this town, but you are one terrifying sonofabitch with those guns.
It'll be the biggest score yet.
Missed you, cousin.
I have no idea what you just said, but it sounded real nice.
I know it ain't no durned bank holiday!
Then why can't I go in there?
Oh. Why didn't you just say so?
Fine. I'll just wait here.
They're gone. What are you --
Well, I hope the boy pulls through. We should know in the morning.
That just might work.
How'd it go in there?
Shoulda learned with Web. Made it look fun, made it look like an adventure. Got Web killed. Now Jim.
He was a boy riding with the most famous outlaws in the West. How was he supposed to say no to that?
You're a piss-poor liar for the smartest man I know.
A war against the railroad. What the hell were we thinking?
Riders --
You and I, we've started... something, you know?  I don't know what'll happen if you do this.
Let the law --
Whose justice? Yours or God's?  When will you stop?
Did you order our houses burned down?
And you're too young.
Well, this land is about to be condemned.
The final route for the railroad is complete.
First of all: you, shut up.  Now, you've given me a thousand miles of railroad to cover. Every time the James Gang strikes, we shift a hundred detectives to that area. But there's just too much open land, too many riverbeds to ride, caves to hide in. This gang operates across four states, often riding a hundred miles between jobs.
No, you idiot. I said "Is it a receptacle tip?" Not, is Luis a despicable twit. Is it a receptacle tip? Get off me.
Pull out.
Pull out, goddamnit!
Do you want to come to my apartment or not?
I want a firm commitment.
But Laurie Kennedy is a total hardbody. What do you think, Bateman?
Jesus, Davis. Yes. That was hilarious. That was you, wasn't it?
What...is...it?
I've gotta...I've gotta...return some videotapes.
Raised lettering, pale nimbus white...
Oh? And what should I say?
That is...if you're not doing anything.
I'm looking for...I guess you could say I just want to have a meaningful relationship with someone special.
Well.
Did you know that Whitney Houston's debut LP called simply Whitney Houston had four number-one singles on it? Did you know that, Christie? Whitney's voice leaps across so many boundaries and is so versatile-though she's mainly a jazz singer-that it's hard to take in the album on a first listening.
What can you tell me about Paul Owen?
How's the investigation going? Taken anyone in for "formal questioning?" 
Yeah. No Finlandia, as usual. Fucking dump.
Oh, right. Of course...We had wanted Paul Owen to come. But he said he had plans...I guess I had dinner with Victoria...the following night.
You like Huey Lewis and the News?
A lot of what Larry says is true. They just clone stuff, or reverse engineer it, and everybody gets stuck with their inferior version cause they --
I mean, if one little comment from Gary is gonna upset you this much --
Look at this.
Why doesn't he ask us to his party. He's never even met you.
It's for the Museum. He knows you're a painter. If anybody should be invited --
I know you think I'm too attached to him, but still. I am close to Gary. And you're the most meaningful person in my life.  I'm going back to the Comix place, why should I be killing myself.
Don't worry, Milo. I'm here as a friend. Or maybe a supplicant.
Beggar. We're at a disadvantage with Outpost. Our experts aren't as smart as theirs. Sometimes we can't tell which technologies pose the threat of a monopoly. We need a really smart guy to help us pick our fights. I'm taking a shot in the dark, here. I can offer you 32,000 a year, a Buick. I'm hoping you've got a feeling it's the right thing to do.
You're interfaced with our dish.
Cool!
You did this -- overnight?
Why did you move around so much? When you were a kid.
Hasn't affected his work, though.
Every entry was authorized.
What're we looking for?
Did you wanna be alone?
Do we post it on the Net?
I felt guilty. 'Cause I "owed so much" to Alice. But even then I was starting to wonder. Is it so great to be so consumed by this one thing that you let another person do your thinking for you? If you have a lucrative skill, it's all anybody wants from you. You grow older but you don't grow up. You turn into -- into --
Wanted to say goodbye to him...
Did you download Corey? In San Jose?
'Pardon me for being rude, It was not me, it was my food.  It just popped up to say hello, and now it's gone back down below.'
'Milk, milk, lemonade.  Round the corner fudge is made.  Stick your finger in the hole, And out comes a tootsie roll!'
To my health.
Hello Austin. Hello Vanessa. This is Basil Exposition, from British Intelligence.  There's a company in Las Vegas called Virtucon that we think may be linked to Dr. Evil. Many of the Virtucon executives gamble at the hotel/casino where you'll be staying. That's the first place you should look.  Well, I'm off to the chat rooms.
Oh, and Austin...
But, wait, I-- you got me again. Oh, and Austin--
Pretty groovy Jumbo Jet, eh? How does a hot chick like you end up working at the Ministry of Defense?
That's fascinating, Vanessa. Listen, why don't we go into the back and shag?
I've been frozen for thirty years, man, I want to see if my bits and pieces are still working.
My wedding tackle.
My meat and two veg.
Have you ever made love to a Chigro?
You know, a Chigro... part Chinese, part Negro...  Chigro.
A limousine has just pulled up.
Really, Austin!
What do we do now?
I'm not going anywhere. We're a team.
I'll hurry back.
Austin, what's your point?
No, no, I want you to have it, even if it's my last piece.
Ow! You shot me!
Hi.
Umm, that also has already happened.
We don't label people here, Scott.
I've come to apply for membership in Brolly --
Congratulations, Mrs. Peel. You have been a worthy opponent. You have tracked us down. You are within an ace of winning.
Quite right, but we still make the rules.
People, too.
Peter Peel was a first class agent. A senior operative. 'X' department Special operations. He was engaged in top secret research. Top priority.  Government approved.
That's better. I say, isn't this where you came in? It's impenetrable, by the way ...
Steed, we really must be --
Mother and Dr. Darling have me under observation. They think I tried to kill you.
You told them. You said I arrived on a camel, shot you four times. Left you for dead.
But that's absurd. I may not be over-fond of you, Steed, but it's not my style.
That's possible. Sir August was convinced he'd met me before. But I'd never met him. Another odd thing. When it rained, he said it was just as someone had promised.
Is that what you think?
Mmm ... what are you doing?
What's that you're wearing?
Ah ... sun tan lotion. Any shops nearby?
Under the circumstances Mother didn't see fit, but I think I can get you in ...
Your research into climate engineering was state-of-the-art. Your experiments could have revolutionized our knowledge of global warming -- had they succeeded. We need your expertise.
Cocky little bastard. I hope he was a baddy.
I'm Alice. Mother said you'd be on your way. Mrs. Peel with you?
I think she really likes you ... Where's Mrs. Peel?
I'm glad you guys came by... What's the occasion?
All right!
Low mileage... Handles like a dream.
So, he's playing hard ball. Well, two can play that game.  Go after him. Stop at nothing. You hear me?
That feels so great.
Um... that's very relaxing.
See? And these are not just ordinary party-goers -- there are professionals in this crowd -- I didn't want any of them. You... You're what I want. Understand?
Great. Now, what do you want to do about it?
Ed, we're so glad you could come over at the last minute and judge our little beauty pageant.
Screw you... Screw that... Don't jerk me around. You promised me 1500 seats for the Police Concert... 1500, not fifteen!... Screw that... Screw you -- Screw Sting.  Hi, guys.
So, Larry, how have you been?
It's my fault. He's dead because... I left those drugs...
Ebbie. Ger... umph... lable...
We'll spend an hour with "Nymphos Without Pants"...
He look familiar?
Nah, that's okay. My brother has to look up old people's asses all day long. Let's give him a break.
Goddamn it, Stephen, lay off!  You stupid dumbshit, you never know when to fucking quit, do you? You ever wonder why your career's in the fucking toilet? Why you're gonna be stuck a Lt. for life?
Did you do it for Tim?
Why'd you come here, Brian?
What is it with you, man, huh? How do you manage to keep coming up with new and amazing ways to screw up? That scotch bullshit? Am I really supposed to believe you came crawling back home because you suddenly felt heart strings moan for the family biz? You were bankrupt, man.
I know you cold, Brian. The scary thing is, you probably could have faked it for awhile. But you see, in this job there's no place to hide. Isn't like selling log cabins. You have a bad day here -- someone dies. And that's not fucking good enough. Want another beer?
Look, Brian, a photographer. Maybe I can get on the cover of LIFE magazine, too.
It's okay, Stephen, I --
With grenadine, right?
Thanks for the invite.
Okay, here's the deal. I'll tell you a story, you tell me one. Fair?
Your first question should be who isn't. It isn't a spark, Brian. Not enough damage. And an insurance pro? Where's the profit margin?
-- No no, your turn. Tell me a story.
Glass found in ignition room is in small, thin pieces, indicating explosion. Lack of discoloration indicates a long, slow burn. Explosion must of come after a slow burn.  You little tease... What were you up to you little bastard, huh? What made you that mad?  Or scared.  It started in this room. Took its time, hung out... but the air ran out. It couldn't breathe. So it was snuffed. But it wasn't dead... still all that trapped heat, lying low, waiting for some sucker to open the door and give it that one gulp of air...
So Seagrave and Holcomb were accountants...
Nice bunch of guys.
Well that's two things to strangle Stephen for. Where is he, anyway?
What?
We gotta roll, Stevie...
They're waitin' man.
Anyway, down here, take a look...
Alderman Swayzak.
It's horrible. They burned her breasts with cigarettes. Christ.
How come all those guys who're looking to get 50 from the Church haven't come up with shit? You got some kinda inside track?
Oh God, my God. it's goddamn good to be good. Forgive me. Father, for I have sinned. It's still goddamn good to be good.
You do know that he's gonna blow up your house, kill your wife and kids --
He's gonna kill you, man. Do you hear me, motherfucker? You. Dead. Get it?
...Benedict Arnold...
My group we need some exposure. Was wondering if you could hook a brother up?
So now I see where you're coming from.  Just because we ain't rapping about Gucci, Timberland, Rolex, Benz, Cristal, ho's and bitches, we're pseudo.
We're revolting against the powers that be, that been enslaving the minds and hearts of all people of color.  And we won't stop rapping till we bring about the overthrow of the government of the U.S. of A.
If you were really down you would get us together with that boss of yours.  What's his name again?
Yeah, him.
DeLa - what's the matter with you.
Nice to meet you.
How different?
DeLa, I'm aboard.  As long as I get to hoof and get paid too!!!
I understand Black culture.  I grew up around black people all my life. If the truth be told I probably know "niggers" better than you, Monsieur Delacroix.  Please don't get offended by my use of the quote-unquote N word.  I got a black wife and three bi-racial children, so I feel I have a right to use that word.  I don't give a damn what Spike says, Tarantino is right.  Nigger is just a word.  If Dirty Ole Bastard can use it every other word so can I.
Every week we follow the trials and tribulations of two real coons - Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat.  The Dusky Duo.
Ignorant, dullwitted, lazy, and unlucky.
Mantan is an uneducated Negro who always by some stroke of unbelievable stupidity makes his best laid plans go haywire.
Yep, you guessed it.
I will not be held responsible for these revisions.  These changes are not the way I want to go.  This is an outrage.  This is a sham.  A violation!
Enough about me, what's happening with you?
How did you know?
How can this be?  You and me at the same time, the exact same thought. It's scary.
You've said that already.
Why'd you do that?
How long have you and Hambone been hangin' out?
That crazy brother of yours doesn't think so.
Oh, is he?  You getting jiggy with Mantan?
Dunwitty and I feel you've been getting too close to him, getting his mind all messed up.
That's the way it came out.  Let me ask you one question.  Have you ever been in want, in need your entire privileged life?
It was.  It is.  But this is a different kind of show.
Mommy, please don't call me that.
I know what's on my birth certificate.  You heard from Daddy?
To answer your question, there are a lot of Negroes in it and what is your definition of buffoons?
Please let me know when you hear from Daddy, get a number or something.
I know all of you have seen the overnight ratings.  Through the roof.  But in this game you gotta be one, two, three steps ahead.  I introduce you to Myrna Goldfarb. She's the best media consultant in the biz.
We both left the hustle and bustle of Uptown, Harlem...
To come back to our roots.
No mo' "city slickers."  Ahh, can't you smell the sweet aroma of the ripe watermelons and high cotton?
Well, thank you Mistuh Sleep 'N Eat.
People show their happiness in a lot of different ways.
Good day to you, young sir.
Where are you bound for?
Is your mother not afraid on account of the highwayman to let one so young as you travel?
Good morning, Private James.  Please come in.  I should like you to meet my uncle, Herr Minister of Police Galgenstein.
That's a very handsome sword you have there.
And now you risk the same fate.  If you are killed, your mother is all alone in the world.
I have no luggage.
No.
Never.
Not even that.
Not one.
That man has, perhaps, not yet been born.
Many worthy of attention; but valuing is something more.  I could value only someone whom I loved.
Your word "empty" makes me laugh. Is it fortunate, or unfortunate?  If it is fortunate, I congratulate myself.  If it is unfortunate, I do not care, for I am not aware of it.
But if, when I love, I am unhappy, I will know that my empty heart was my good fortune.
It is only too possible.  Love requires a mutual harmony which is difficult, and it is even more difficult to make it last.
A man may need to do that, and find it amusing; but a girl is bound by other laws.
How so?
I feel the ribbon.
Was he cheated?
Did you buy the horse, papa?
But I will have it on my birthday, won't I?
Don't like 'em, don't eat 'em, don't make no damn difference to me.
He is the only one unaccounted for.
Holy fuck... Holy fuck, what the fuck did you guys do?
You smoke, Ray?
Not true, Cadet, I've got a gun --
Back up.
Shut up.  Let me see your grenades.
You gotta untie me.  I didn't do this thing, Ray.
Maybe, but that don't make me a killer --
You... I've seen you around the Base. But you...  You're not Army, are you?
You tried to pin three stone murders on Dunbar --
Or you, Levi? When is it finally going to come out that you were the one who killed him?
He's not done by a longshot, I can get more out of him --
I'm sorry, Bill.
You're a good soldier, Bill.
Thank you. At some point in there I'm gonna rub my nose. When I do, go at him with everything you got.
Something wrong?
West was a monster! Fifteen years ago, I was here, I was Section Eight, I was Pike. Fuck being the knife dummy -- that thing he did, stripping Pike down, making him stand outside all night? He did that every year, he did that to me. Fifteen years ago, I wanted him dead, and now I'm supposed to care that somebody offed him? Sorry, no can do. I tried.
You wanted to break him.
What?
How?
I don't think I want to hear this --
Nunez was chasing Dunbar.
But you didn't see it, right?
Who, Levi --
Cadet Michael Mueller, I hereby place you under military arrest for the murder of Sergeant Nathan West --
You are to be stripped of all weapons and placed under guard --
Until we return to base, and ballistics can match your weapon to the slugs in Sergeant West's body --
You both know if you do this, if you go after a Senator's son and you're wrong... it's not just me in the hot seat anymore.
I don't have a job, but I would have a job if you gave me one. And I may not have much, but I have more determination than any man you're ever going to meet.
You won't find a better place!
Yeah.
It's okay, just leave it.
I thought you said you didn't have a church wedding.
What, a father's not allowed to talk about his son?
Jesus Christ.
Come on, Will. Everyone likes that story.
Josephine actually went to the Congo last year.
Let's get out of here.
Wait! I need those!
Were you and my father having an affair?
It's bad.
You need to go.
Is that Dr. Bennett's car?
Is he awake?
It's enough isn't it?
You know what I mean babe, It's enough. We can stop.
Yes.
How's that? We can't drink our piss can we?
You must find some glasses, small, for the toast, and some plates.
She says 'Hello' to you. Go for it John!
What did he say? Tell me!
What does he want. The Russian shithead. What do you want ?
Today is bath day.
You don't have to do this. I can look after myself.
What?
It wasn't what I wanted.
You don't understand me.
I don't know.
Hurry. I'll wait for you here.
I brung you a little basket of goodies. Fresh squash, tomatoes, some okra, butter beans.
Just wanted to say how much I appreciate you helping me the other day. My niece, she's cured up, and I got you to thank.
Hi.
You ain't the kicker, are you?
Cuz let me tell you, you boys gotta run the ball more. You get into a kicking game, ya'll gonna lose.
And then you had to fall in love with the school slut.
With all she was doin'. With all the shit she kept doing! You stayed stuck to that bitch's ass and you wouldn't let go.
You wanna go home?
GODDAMMIT, RAE!
SHUT UP! SHUT UP!
Now, no harm's come to you... and I aim to keep it that way. Ain't gonna... gonna run a train over ya... or however you call it... see... you was runnin' wild on me... these fever dreams you was havin'... these fits. I'd be chasin' you all night.
My Daddy was one of the first mens to organize soil conservation in these parts. That's a group of farmers, you know, each season they'd rotate the crop. Know why it's best to rotate em like that?
Could you do somethin' for me?
Laz? Can I sleep with you tonight?
I didn't mean it nothin' dirty.
You ever seen a train run on a woman?
Why don't you go'on and ask her. She need to talk wit somebody with sense. Folks been ruttin' and beatin' on this gal all her days. And this is how I'm handling it.
You won't at the square this mornin'.
I think if I just piss... I'll be okay.
I'm just in one of my moods. You know how I get.
I'm sorry... I didn't mean to shout...
But... Momma... just tell me... not gonna be mad... we can just talk about it... Be eye to eye on this... You don't even got to say you're sorry... Just say how you knew...
Nick, let's go hunting.  Bag Cavello.
Nick... You up?
It's incredible.  Hit him or something.
Where do we start looking for this guy?
How'd you get this?
Chikuwa, Hampen, Kobu, Konnayaku, Ganmodoki --
Broiled fish paste cake, Kelp roll, soybean curd, devils tongue --
It's very small.
It's illegal, Nick.
What's that for?
She ever pull down her shades?
You'll get Ich killed.
Bullshit, Nick.  And don't tell me this is all just about Charlie. It's not.
Doesn't speak a word of English. And he won't speak Japanese either. No papers.  The Japanese embassy is very interested.
He's wanted in Japan.  They want him first.  Then we can have him.
Hey...!  HEY, I'M TALKING TO YOU, INSPECTOR!
Can't thank you enough, Mr. Sebastian. If you hadn't come along...
I want more life, fucker.
Show me something?
I want to do it.
If you don't, we will.  It has to be total, Deckard.  That's an order from as high as it comes.  Got it?
Prosit.
Don't make me laugh.  It makes me pee.
Hey, it's okay.  I like to pee. So how are you doing?
From what I hear you're doing great.  Bryant tells me you're going like a god damn one-man army.  Making a lot of money, huh?
Money?
Let's hear it.
You see I lost my contacts a couple of days ago around here somewhere and my sight is a little... What am I supposed to be looking for?
Me.
There's two reasons a man rejects help.  Either because he's so good at what he does he doesn't think he needs it, or he's so insecure he can't admit it.
Two of us might be more effective than one.
What do people do in the afternoon?
Why do you call it retire, why don't you call it murder?
Don't you think anything that can suffer deserves to be considered?
Do you think I simulated what happened between us?
She didn't know?
Whatcha mean, I'm not helping?
Twenty.
I'm Nina Aron, Adam.
Very well, thank you. I'm with the County Family Services Department. Eve tells me you've been living in a bomb shelter most of your life.
Bon soir, mademoiselle!
No.  I'm from out of town.  I'm here on business.
Rogers Hornsby's worth like four thousand dollars!
Wait, Eve, please!  Wait.
Pick you up at eight tomorrow morning.
Why, thank you!  Very nice to have met you, Cliff!  May I ask you a question?
Actually,no. I was wondering why Cliff likes to wear another man's underpants.
He's going to kill himself.  Go skate out on the bike path! It's that way!
That's ridiculous.
I went to Sophie's and she was very hospitable.
But it just wasn't where I wanted to be so I left as politely as I could and found a taxi.  But I asked the driver to drop me here instead of at the hotel.  There's a song Mister Como sings called "On the Street Where You Live."  You know it?
Are you all right?
All in yellow?  Oh!  That was my father!
I know it has been terrible.  But it wasn't your fault. And now all the decay is over with and things are going to get better. You understand?
I've got to go, now.
That's always a good idea! Would you like some money? I have a great deal of it.
How do I leave here?
C'est bon, Monsieur.
I've got goose-bumps all over me.
I'm sorry. I took the Lord's name in vain again, didn't I?  I'm so sorry.
Whatcha looking at?
Say what?!
I do alright.
I'm afraid you've got to.
Oh, my God!
No!  Not the police!  Don't call them!
No, I can't have that! They'll come with their cars and their guns and their handcuffs--
You know, I don't think so. I'm confused but you know, I don't think he'd ever hurt me. I don't think he'd hurt anyone.
I was frightened and I didn't know what to think! But you know-I believe him. I think he just wants to go home. Wherever the hell that is...
How long will we have to stay down here?
Days??
But, what if I go into labor? That could happen any time.
Now you listen to me Calvin Webber, when this baby comes, you're going to be out in the waiting room smoking yourself to death with all the other fathers.
No.  I think it's just right.
Yes!
One who doesn't glow in the dark.
He's smart.
Eve!  This guy is un-be-liev-able!
That water's freezing!
What are you going to do? Go over to her place and kick in the door?
Adam!!
Jeffrey, you're not going down by Lincoln, are you?
Are you Detective Williams?
My name is Jeffrey Beaumont - I live near you. I believe you know my father, Tom Beaumont - Beaumont's Hardware Store?
He's alright, I guess. I hope. They're doing tests, that's why I'm home from school. I was over at the hospital this morning and I was going home and in the field behind our neighborhood. There behind Vista, I found an ear.
Yeah. I've got it here in this bag. I thought I should bring it to you.
And that man came out with a third man - this well-dressed guy. Here's the photo. I think a girl named Dorothy Vallens is in trouble with these people. I think Frank has taken her husband and her son.
Well now Jeffrey, how did you come to get so involved?
Is Sandy part of this?
Who knows you have these?
You're all through with this now?
Do you like talk like that?
Hi, can I come in?
Do you like my body?
I'll call you.
What?
Where are we going, Frank?
Frank?
Yes, but.
What are you lookin' at?
God, you scared me.
Nothing. I'm fine.
Hey, you ivy league shit. COME HERE!
I've gotta go in.
You really want to do this, don't you?
You want to tell me about it?
Wow. Should you tell my father?
You saw a lot in one night.
Twice. Without her sensing anything?
Did you see her undressed?
Yeah?
Who, me? Why should it?
You're sure right. It is a strange world.
I don't know. I had a dream. In fact, the night I met you.  In the dream the world was dark because there weren't any robins. You know, birds. Robins stood for love, and all of a sudden thousands of robins flew down and brought this blinding light of love. And it felt like that love would be the only thing that would make any difference. I guess, until the robins come there is trouble.
So are you.  I mean you're a neat guy. We better get back.
Okay.
Please get to your father and send him and the police to Dorothy's apartment right away. Be sure your father comes. Something is happening over there. They're hurting someone, the guy she loves. Tell them to hurry. I'm going over right now.
Listen kid, I think you better understand who you're dealing with here.
Oh, God! Don't kill me! We're on the same side! The boss musta sent you in as back up, huh? Oh, shit, please! I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man.  They call me the funny fuckin' man!
Chest pocket.  Shit!
Anybody see ya?
They got nothing.
Well, we tried ta make friends and she gave me a shot ta the nuts.
Would someone please come over here and...
me up the...
"Now, that wasn't too polite, was it?"
We're doing some serious shit here. Now, get a hold of yourself, asshole.
That's the guy that got us off the hook with the "Checkov" thing.
She was in here when it went down.
They were wearing masks.
The two bullets went in here, through the top of the skull, criss-crossed and exited through the eyeballs. This one clue tells us three distinct facts. Number one... Duffy.
While Greenly's getting coffee, anybody else want anything?
Promise me boys.
Those rat fucks! All of them were all laughing at me man!
We'll keep going, Roc.
Do your thing Father. Don't fuck this up.
Just be natural, goddamit.
Did you see what I meant about the window?
That's true. But what if they change the locks?
But he didn't say anything.
Holy shit.
Armored trucks are very difficult to steal, Anthony.
Right. Get back to me on that one. Once your plan is worth a shit.
Actually. If you knew the exact route, you could plant explosives under a manhole cover and blow it up as it went over.
See, now we've got a plan.
I can't believe he just jumped you.
Who's in the car?
No fighting. It wasn't Bob's fault.
Uh-huh?
You're kidding.
Does it float?
You mean like techniques?
Well, he agreed 100% that Bob should be dropped. And he also agreed you were a liability. But he felt his talent would make up for your weaknesses.
Let them fight.
Anthony, I --
Give him a second.
Were you born in Mexico?
That's Anthony.
Yeah.
If you're that worried, maybe we should just steal one.
Bob.
What's your fucking problem? You're a shithead!
I mean, Jesus Christ, Bob. You didn't have some vicious lunatic screaming, "I'm going to remember you!"
How long has he been in there?
Then how come they haven't set the bail yet? That's unconstitutional.
You said 48 hours!
Bob, you're lying!
Is he breathing?
I might have mentioned it.
I know, Bob. You were on a secret mission.
Is he good?
I don't know.
He left yesterday on the night train. He's probably just getting in now.  You'll have to hurry.
Moscow? What the Hell's he going to Moscow for?
Jesus... I, Zorn... I have to call his family. Tell them...
It changes things. That knowledge. Doesn't it?
That's not what happened to your parents.
What do you want?
No... How?
But we were so careful.
God, I miss you. I don't know what to do without you.
It's me.
-- so there were two of these explosive charges placed on the power lines. One of them failed. The fingerprint...  That's from the one that didn't go off.
-- who? -- who else is here? --
Is it fresh?
Did the priest say anything about the Resurrection? Or was it all about Judgment?
If I pay homage to another's throne, then how am I a king?
The crown is that of Scotland. And Scotland is William Wallace.
Shut up, would you! How can I concentrate?!
The Bruce is not coming, William.
Can you do it when it matters? As it matters in battle? Could you crush a man with that throw?
No. I have it to ease the suffering of the children of this war.
Forgive me, Sire. I thought that generosity might demonstrate your greatness to those you mean to rule.
This Scottish rebel... Wallace? He fights to avenge a woman?
You understand. Consider, before you laugh and say no. You will never own a throne, though you deserve one. But just as the sun will rise tomorrow, some man will rule England. And what if his veins ran not with the blood of Longshanks, but with that of a true king?
Come, it'll help you sleep.
We're gonna be late again.
Please, mom. People will talk.
Did Da -- Jason --- get good grades?
Just. Like. Jason.
Go on. Nothing can hurt you. Remember, this is only a movie. You're completely safe.
The car doesn't vanish Evan. The movie in your head has broken, that's all. But now I've re-spliced it and I want you to tell me about the car.
Are you stupid or what?
Did your mom say if Lenny was... okay?
Oh my God, that was good. Where'd you learn all those new tricks?
Oh, I thought you were my eight o'clock. Make it fast, I'm expecting someone.
Kayleigh? Do you ever think about "us?" I mean, wonder if it could ever have been different between the two of us?
I was?
I don't get it.
I never knew that. So then you still sometimes think of us... together?
And...?
Then you think it might have worked out?
Are you okay? You looked like you were somewhere else for a second there.
Smells like sex in here.
Are you sure you even packed it?
Lung cancer?
Maybe it went out. Should someone check it?
Good.
I want you to take Miss Lund home.
Shall we draw up the papers, or is our handshake good enough?
And Mademoiselle?
Strange. I know so very little about you.
How did you get in?
No, Richard, no. What has happened to you? Last night we said --
But Richard, no, I, I --
I must find out what Berger knows.
Whatever I'd say, you'd carry on. Victor, why don't you tell me about Rick? What did you find out?
Yes?
I can't get over you two. She was asking about you earlier, Rick, in a way that made me extremely jealous.
Are you enough of a businessman to appreciate an offer of a hundred thousand francs?
I'll raise it to two hundred thousand.
There must be some reason why you won't let me have them.
I beg your pardon?
No, Captain, please.
I am making out the report now. We haven't quite decided whether he committed suicide or died trying to escape.
Oh, there is no hurry. Tonight he'll be at Rick's. Everybody comes to Rick's.
Mademoiselle.
You know, I think now I shall pay a call on Yvonne, maybe get her on the rebound, eh?
Oh, laugh if you will, but I happen to be familiar with your record. Let me point out just two items. In 1935 you ran guns to Ethiopia. In 1936, you fought in Spain on the Loyalist side.
The winning side would have paid you much better.
I have my orders.
As I suspected, you're a rank sentimentalist.
Why do you interfere with my little romances?
I suppose you know what you're doing, but I wonder if you realize what this means?
Call off your watch-dogs you said.
Make it official, if you like.
Thank you.  Will you have a drink with me please?
I forgot. You never drink with...  I'll have another, please.  You despise me, don't you?
But why? Oh, you object to the kind of business I do, huh? But think of all those poor refugees who must rot in this place if I didn't help them. That's not so bad. Through ways of my own I provide them with exit visas.
But think of all the poor devils who cannot meet Renault's price. I get it for them for half. Is that so parasitic?
Well, Rick, after tonight I'll be through with the whole business, and I am leaving finally this Casablanca.
Where is she? Have you seen her?
Polaris, where are you?  Maybe I'm too far south.
They're never going to see you.  You're just another piece of trash in the ocean.
They're always on autopilot.  Or else it's night, or you're in the sun, or you're in the trough of a wave.  They'll never see you.
Hmmm.  Feels like it might have gotten wet.
Yeah.  A long time ago.
Oh?  You've tried?
My last chapter's in there, and the damn machine's jammed.
Look, I love the puppy.  I love you.  But I have to go.
I have to.
I didn't want to.  It just happened.  One day Gary was there.  He took care of everything.  He took care of me.  I was a mess.
What will you do?
Doc, I'm not on the island.  I'm not on the raft.  I'm alive.  I'm so glad to be back, I can't tell you.  I just want out of here.
It seemed like she had such a good time last time.
Hmmm.  Durango, Colorado; Asheville, North Carolina, then...canceled her account.
Malaysia's tanking.  We're meeting in ten in operations.
To Wilson.
Only if you can afford it.
Oh my, yes! This is a *far* superior taste--and crisp, too! You know, so many apples are disappointingly mealy. I wonder of most of the apples in my life weren't meant for pies!
It's gettin' late. I think I'll pack it in.
Uh... have you been *feeling* okay?
The screen is enormous! Imagine King Kong up *there*! Have you seen a lot of movies here?
Do you think I'm having a good time? Do you think I'm just *teasing* you? Do you think I *know* whether I want you or Wally?
I grew up with Wally. I began my adult life with him.
No! That's not all there is to it! I love you, too--I *know* I do.
Do you think she'll be all right?
I'm okay--I can walk.
That's a heavy sedation.
Uh... it's the end of October.
"Burma run" because you fly over Burma...
That's better. I can tell you got yourself some education. Them's good hands you got, Homer. Them hands you got, they know what they're doin'-- ain't that right?
What's that? What's it called?
Fuzzy is not uncommon. I tell you, there's something about the premature babies of alcoholic mothers. They seem susceptible to every damn thing that comes along.
I haven't, either. But you *will*. The morons who write the books should do a little research *here*.
I don't need this--I know all about my condition.
What's that?
That's *it*?
They told me I was too old to serve.
She's *good* with that knife! She's real fast. She's a lot better with that knife than *you* is, Muddy! And who do you suppose taught her?
You're lucky he didn't cut your *nipples* off, man.
Oh. Well, thanks for the drink.
Hey, Jake... When am I gonna get to play the Inside?
Yeah, but come on... All I get to do is cry and get insulted.
He's just as crooked as the next guy. You'd think he'd have more important things to do with tax payer dollars.
Not that I recall. What do you want us to do about it?
So we go to the bar.
We'll take care of it.
Masters of our own destiny.
When?
We're going to make it back, Grant. Three or four times over.
Why?
That tip not work-out for you fellas?
I lost my head. I'm... Sorry. I don't know what happened.
We had to see what your deal was. I'm just a little superstitious.
We're getting down to the wire. Apparently another company has a similar product in R&D right now. If they beat us to it...
No. You trusted him... You were just getting square.
Stop waving that thing around.
Uh...
I'm just thinking out loud here, but... Two million in a briefcase?
And we got rid of the red head.
He's wheeling around two million dollars in cash and he wants to stop to use the bathroom. You believe this?
The King? Jake, you play the heavy rackets like that... They put the lug on for nothing at all.
I don't doubt your talent. You looking for that place in the hall of fame?
So what do you want?
Preliminary forensics suggests he was sitting there, bloated and purple in his egg foo young for at least seventy two hours. Alfonse was not a small man and there was a lot of food ordered, so you can imagine the smell. Bad for the neighbors, good for me because in all the time I've been looking for Jake, this is only the second time I've even gotten a whiff of him.
You sell it.
Don't be an idiot. How hard do you think it is to sell one drug dealer's drugs to another drug dealer? If Vig's right, we might be looking at a hundred, maybe a hundred fifty grand...
I've been watching you work. You're the best in the place. But you know that.
Hi-ya... I'll call you back.  Now then...
All right. As what?
No, no. I'm not ready for you. There's some vodka in the freezer.
I loved it blond.
What?
I'm sorry, madam, we don't accept gratuities in the UK. It's different in South Africa.
That trick tonight, I don't think I've ever seen that before.
I didn't.
I'm sorry.
You've been avoiding me.
I'm Lucy.
I'm a witch. A white witch. Why don't we move on?
Does Bella come here?
You've been recommended by the management here. They know your father. He has a bit of a reputation, hasn't he?
In any case, I understand you've had some previous experience... in South Africa.  You'll find the rules a little different here. Before we start, you haven't got a police record, have you?
You want me to check?
Thanks for the information.
It didn't go off.
It didn't go off.
Talby, Talby, can you read me?
This is Lieutenant Doolittle calling Bomb #20. I repeat previous order, you are to disarm yourself and return immediately to the bomb bay. Do you understand?
Bomb, this is Doolittle. You are not to detonate, repeat, you are not to detonate in the bomb bay. Disarm yourself. This is an order.
What are you gonna name it?
The new star. What are you gonna name it?
You know, Talby, you really ought to eat with the rest of us. You spend too much time up here.
Must get lonely being up here so much.
...Should spend some time below, see more of the rest of the ship...
You'll have plenty of time for that, you know. Figure it this way: twenty years in space and we've only aged three, so there'll be plenty of time to stare around...
Phoenix Asteroids? Never heard of 'em.
Commander Powell, this is Doolittle. Ah, there's something serious come up, sir, and I have to ask you something.
Commander, sir, we have a big problem. You see, the Veil Nebula bomb, Bomb Number 20, is stuck. It won't drop from the bomb bay. It refuses to listen and plans to detonate in --  -- less than eleven minutes.
What's that, sir?
Well, sir, the Dodgers broke up, disbanded over thirteen years ago.
You don't understand, sir, we can't get the bomb to drop.
Yes sir. Negative effect.
Negative effect.
That's correct, sir.
What should we do, sir? The time is running out.
I never woulda done it.  Probably not, anyway.  I mean, I actually think you're pretty cool.
Nothing happened between me and Tia.
Can I say something in my defense?
Lemme put some clothes on.
So Max, what do you do with all your money?
Goodnight Bears.  Goodnight chairs. Goodnight kittens.  Goodnight mittens. Goodnight clocks.  And goodnight socks. Goodnight little house.  And goodnight--
I know, Honey, but just think how exiting it will be-- new house, new school, new friends--
Because we can't.  There's nothing here for us anymore.
No...
How'd you find me?
Am I s'posed to be flattered by all the attention?
So now you tracked me down.  What d'ya think?
How does Mrs. Eyes Only like being married to a guy on everybody's hit list?
Girlfriend?
What's your shot in all this?  Being a famous, anonymous, underground, pirate, cyber-journalist can't be much of a payday.
So, what, you just like the sound of your own voice?
You miss the good ol' days.  Even though there were still poor people who died from diseases when they didn't have to. And rich people spent obscene amounts of money redecorating their houses to match the cat.  Those good ol' days?
So what are you gonna do about it?
Personally, I'm more interested in going fast on my motorcycle or climbing the Trans American building with my pals. Instead of giving myself a headache over stuff I can't do anything about.
Is the social studies class over for today?
We got separated right away.  I never knew how many made it.
I remember fine.  I just didn't understand what was going on.  They never told us anything except what to do.  It took me a long time afterwards to figure things out.
I know they made me.  Even got the label on my neck to prove it.
Yeah...a made-up creature.  Like in mythology...with the head of a lion, the body of a goat and the tail of...
Your basic hodge-podge.
I'm looking for a lady who works here.
Who's this guy?  This isn't who we're looking for...her name was Hannah.
Thank you.
Zero... C'mon, Dan I don't have all day.
Just give it to me.  I'll remember.
Who are you?
Hey, Sketchy--
Hot run to 842 Beulah, corner of Haight... And you can tell your pal Theo he just got his worthless ass fired. Not that he cares but the wife and kid might.
Whoa... she is a killer.
Ann Arbor?
Namely?
Will somebody please tell those chicks disco is dead.
Ok, dudes, follow my lead.
No... You don't think...?
Are you on the crapper with one of those antenna phones? Sounds like you're taking a dump the size of Butte, Montana.
Anyway, listen up. They're gone!
The KISS tickets, you nimrod! They're just fuckin' gone! Please tell me you have'm!
It was stolen!
Someday you'll have a son just like you, Jeremiah. A boy who lies through his teeth, buys demonic records, and smokes the dope just like you.
What?!
Poor, Jam, man. Imagine having to stash your KISS records inside Carly Simon album covers. No question, Mrs. Bruce is a psycho-bitch from hell.
Simplicity, Hawk.
Hey, kid, that's okay. I don't wanna see KISS that ba...
What do you want?
Look, you can have my wallet...
What was his name?
"The Last Unicorn!" By Samantha Darko.
Hey...
So when you sleepwalk, can you remember afterward? Like, do you dream?
I know she's here. She never leaves the house.
Time is running out. We have to go see Grandma Death. We have to talk to her.
No. Frank.
I have to take the girls to Los Angeles tomorrow.
If I'm lucky.  So... I won't be back until the first. Your dad will be back on Sunday, so I've put Elizabeth in charge until then. She has the car... so she can drive you to your therapy tomorrow.
Ms. Pomeroy... what's going on?
Where are you going?
That's bullshit. You're a good teacher.
What do I tell the rest of the class when they ask about you?
I'd like to believe that I'm not... but I've just never seen any proof. So I just choose not to bother with it. It's, like, I could spend my whole life thinking about it... debating it in my head. Weighing the pros and cons. And in the end, I still wouldn't have any proof. So... I don't even debate it any more. Because it's absurd.  I don't want to be alone.  So, does that make me, like, an atheist?
Your medication. They're placebos. Just pills made out of water.
Donald, an atheist is someone who denies altogether the existence of a God. You are an agnostic. An agnostic is someone who believes that there can be no proof of the existence of God... but does not deny the possibility that God exists.
I... What can we do?
I got twelve classrooms full of water. All coming from a busted water main.
All right! 7:55. Everybody goes home.
That was your mom. She wanted you to have this.
You-betcha.
Oh, shut up. I thought it might help you get some sleep.
Shut up, yous guys. Look, Amber, I'm not gonna win. And let's be honest, a family only needs one "Liza" and you know Peter's got much better legs than me.
Oh c'mon, I love 'em, but you know they only had me 'cause Peter needed a kidney.
Then do it for Peter. Mrs. Leeman used to call him a "skinny little fag" when he'd bag her groceries. He'd pop his Nancy-belt if his old jacket somehow, I don't know, got her back.
Mom!
Okay. Yesterday I... I got this picture. So I kinda, y'know, I'm thinkin' no. I'm gonna, I -- I -- I'm gonna quit the pageant.
What?
So, uh, I -- I'm not really busy Friday. I just said that -- y'know.
Annette, just use your hand.
Lester?
It's a two-hundred dollar fine!
Excuse me, Father, Mother, when are we moving back to Tokyo? I can't stand this place anymore. They put butter on everything.
I'm sorry, Dad, but with all due respect, my name isn't "Tina," it's Seiko.
Father...
You know, I'd be lost without a telephone.  Now - where were we? Oh, yes - I just made you Secretary of War.  The first thing you do is buy ammunition -- you buy it from me and I get 10% commission.
You get half mine and I get half yours.
Then we've gotta start one. Do you know how to start a war?
Now -- how many men you got in your army?
That's not fair -- we've only got fifty thousand.
That's the spirit -- fifty-fifty.
Well, we'll let that one go.  Now -- how many battalions you got?
I wish you were still working for me, so I could ask you to resign. How're ya fixed for cavalry?
That's funny, we've got five thousand horses but no men.
Not a bad idea.  If our horses get tired they can ride your men for a change.  Now, I don't mind letting you have our horses, but you must promise to put them through their maneuvers.
Are you sure you're not tired?
What'll I do with this card?
My purse has been stolen -- the plans of war are in it.
This is all Firefly's fault -- that idiot, that fool...
Fine nothing!  I didn't want war... My plan was to marry Mrs. Teasdale and overthrow Firefly.
Frederick, why are you so interested in this particular case?
What are you going to do?
Don't be frightened. He won't hurt you.
Treves. Well done.
It was a great pleasure to meet you, Mr. Merrick.
Mr. Treves says that you are in the theatre. Do you live there?
Well, even to work there would be wonderful. Is it beautiful?
Alas, no.
Tell me about it, please!
Romance!
Good morning, Mr. Merrick.
Mr. Merrick likes the food here. Don't you John?
Would you... would you like to see my mother?
Is it the one you wanted?
Are you sure? Because I can take it back.
He's had his share of "smacks", Mothershead. I expect that's what drives him under the bed. We must use patience and understanding with this man.
So you'll bring him to me, tomorrow, 10:00 a.m.? Mr...?
How d'you KNOW we're "friends"?
No!
Erik. You don't understand.
But you don't realize....
But --
Would you like us to sing to you?
It's all part of our safety regulations. You see if someone were to get hurt they might get angry and then... well...
I've come to take you back to the land of the living.
Why?
How deep IS the ocean?
I want to die...  No, I don't!
What did he say?
A magic dishcloth.
And you, Keitel Blacksmith.
Look, I bagged it last week.
Yes it does! We could be at sea for months.
What's all the panic about?
Oh! Who cares? We're HOME!
Wasn't it, Keitel?
It's a tradition.
I was a Berserk for King Harald Fairhair...
I went berserk in every battle I ever fought for King Harald...
So did my father and his father before him.
But it's a responsibility being a Berserk.
You must only let the red rage take hold of you in the thick of battle.
Well I'M certainly not, either.
I'm sorry Naomi couldn't make it. You okay? You seem quiet.
Come over after I'm done here?
You rat.
I'm sorry.
Why what?
So you like bookstores, huh?
Me too. It is Rain Dogs, by the way.
The song's 9th and Hennepin. I spent most of the train ride trying to remember. "Till you're full of rag water and bitters and blue ruin/And you spill out/Over the side to anyone who'll listen." Remember?
Remember? "And you take on the dreams of the ones who have slept there/And I'm lost in the window/I hide on the stairway/I hang in the curtain/I sleep in your hat..."  Oh, shit. I'm so stupid. Sorry.
Y'know, I'm sort of psychic.
Well, I go to a psychic and she's always telling me I'm psychic. She should know. Do you believe in that stuff?
Me neither. But sometimes I have premonitions, so, I don't know. Maybe that's just coincidence. Right? Y'know, you think something and then it happens, or you think a word and then someone says it? Y'know?
Exactly. Exactly! That's exactly my feeling about it. It's hard to know. Like, okay, but how many times do I think something and it doesn't happen? That's what you're saying, right? You forget about those times. Right?
But I think I am. I like to think I am.
Sorry. My life isn't that interesting. I go to work. I go home. I don't know what to say.
A wino? Jesus, Are you from the fifties? A wino!  Face it, Joel. You're freaked out because I was out late without you, and in your little wormy brain, you're trying to figure out, did she fuck someone tonight?
More?
Look at you, cutey! What are we doing?
Joel, I'm not a concept. I want you to just keep that in your head. Too many guys think I'm a concept or I complete them or I'm going to make them alive, but I'm just a fucked-up girl who is looking for my own peace of mind. Don't assign me yours.
I had you pegged, didn't I?
Probably.
I know.
I wish we did. You married?
Don't worry. It's really solid this time of year.
Hi, it's Joel.
I'm just, y'know, passing the time best I can till I can see you.
You must have been crazy.
I don't know. Panties and --
Clementine.
So you're still on the Zoloft?
Yeah. Come to bed. I'm cold.
Boo.
I don't know what to do! I don't know what to do! Crap. Crap...
I don't know! I just said that!
Howard, your one o'clock.
Thanks.  So... do we talk about this... or what?
Do you love me? Did you love me? Something. I listened to my tape. I can't believe I've been sitting right in front of it for a year. It's like listening to someone else's story. I mean, I hear myself talking about having sex with you and I can't even imagine you naked. I can't even say "naked" to you!
You made me have an abortion.
You made me have you erased! I loved you. I love you! How could you --
Oh, hi.
I think he's in a conference. Unfortunately. I'm really sorry.
I can handle it. He's pretty much on auto-pilot anyway.
But that's an old story now...... I can't believe that you would leave the Butte.
Did that last comment sound too profound to be coming outta my mouth? It's not original. It's something I picked up from the Chink.
What are you doing?
But I don't want you to leave. Please stay. We can go to dinner. I owe you a dinner. And tonight... we can... really make love.
Why? Why do you have to go?
But here you are, still a virgin -- you are virginal yet, aren't you?
Yes, well, what I'm getting at is that there comes a time when it is psychologically impossible for a woman to lose her virginity. She can't wait too long, you know. Now, there's no reason why you must lose yours. I mean, just ponder it a bit, that's all.
I can't be certain that you would. But what have you got to lose?
...cancel our leave and send us out on some bullshit mission...!
Solid as a rock.  Hey, Smith...
What...?
They thought it said, "Liberatis me," "Save me," but it's not "me." It's "tutemet:" "Save yourself."
Incredible... These are the same coordinates before the ship disappeared... this, this happened? This isn't some kind of hoax?
You've reached the First Containment Seal. The engineering decks are on the other side.
What's the hold up?
I put in for a replacement for you but no one...
Justin, check the containment for radiation leaks. Peters...
That's the engineering containment. And there's the main airlock. We can dock there.
It's insane.
If it worked.
We're leaving.
"...to rescue the crew and salvage the ship." The crew is dead, Dr. Weir. This ship killed them. And now it's killing us.
Maybe you're right. But it's still my command, and I have leeway to abort when I feel there is an unacceptable threat to my crew. And I think there is.  Starck, download all the files from the Event Horizon's computers. Coop, Smith, finish moving the CO2 scrubbers back onto the Clark.
I don't like it either, but you know the rules: we get the call, we go. Is the course locked in?
It is now.  We're locked in.
Get off the Clark now and wait for me at the airlock.
The antennae array's completely fried, we've got no radio, no laser, no highgain... No one's going to be coming to help us.
Oxygen is not the problem.
It's building up with every breath we take. And the CO2 filters on the Event Horizon are shot.
I thought of that, with the filters from the Clark, we've got enough breathable air for twenty hours. After that, we'd better be on our way home.
The Event Horizon sensors show the same thing: "Bio-readings of indeterminate origin." Right before that wave hit the Clark, there was some kind of surge, right off the scale, but now it's back to its previous levels.
I don't know, but whatever it is, it's not the crew.
What?
Don't worry about it. He's hard, but he's fair. You're lucky to be shipping out with him. He's one of the few Captains in the service with experience in the Outer Reach.
He served on the Goliath.
Almost got it.
I didn't see anything and I don't have to see anything. This ship is fucked.
What if the air has gone bad? We can't wear these suits forever.
What are you doing?
You know, you could'a run an ad in the personals.
Where is Reed?
Oh my G-g-g. What did you... do to Ben?
Isn't that your speech?
This is your dream, Reed. You should be the one up there.
You got a chisel round here?
Where... where am I?
Reed?... Sue?
You're hot!
I mean, you feel a little feverish.
My shift ends at four, but I couldn't --
We should stay here until we can define the extent of our changes...
Flame on, flame off. Flame on, flame off --
Johnny, slow down. Think. You know mom didn't raise us to --
Sir, I've always wondered... Why Sue? You could have any woman in the world but --
For science.
I mean, you broke up with me, right?
Remember our first date here...? God, I was so nervous.
Funny how things turn out, isn't it?
It's just business.
If these molecules aren't stable, they could make us worse, maybe even kill us.
Something happened to them, mon.
Everyone wants to know where Lisa is. How should I know where Lisa is?  What am I gonna do? Now my little sister goes to the same high school. The party's over.  So who do you have first period?
You're not going to tell me, are you?
Well, that's exactly why I brought some Wisk for the jacuzzi.
Why don't you take off your clothes, Mike?
Mike! You have a mess on C-9!
Yo.
Mark. What happened to your date?
Did you go home and get it?
Are you Linda Barrett?
Seen the new Playboy?
Suzanne Somers' tits.
Face it. With some guys you have to make the first move. A lot of guys are just... wussies.
Stacy, what are you waiting for? You're fifteen. I did it when I was thirteen. It's no huge thing. It's just sex. If you don't, one of the other girls will.
Don't you think it meant anything to him. Even if I am fifteen?
God, Stacy, it's not that sad. It's just David Soul and Ricardo Montalban.
You just ripped my card in two!
Aloha, Mr. Hand!
What do you do with the jackets people leave here?
You keep them.
Sure. I'll... have another Coke.
Hi, Mark.
But he will be available? Perhaps later this morning?
There's no hurry! The race is over!
Naked!?
Thanks for the ride. Thanks a lot. I like you guys. Don't worry about me.
Turn up the fucking music! My heart feels like an alligator! Volume! Clarity! Bass! We must have bass! What's wrong with us? Are you goddamn old ladies?
What the fuck are we doing out here? Somebody call the police! We need help!
That's good...
Don't run. They'd like any excuse to shoot us.
Fuck yes. I was beginning to think I was going to have to go out and get one of the goddamn maids to do it.
I gave the cabbie an extra ten bucks to make sure she gets there safe. Also, I told him I'd be there myself in an hour, and if she wasn't, I'd come back out here and rip his lungs out.
As your attorney, I advise you to tell me where you put the goddamn mescaline.
OK, goddamnit!... Look... I'll call her. I'll get her off our backs. You're right. She's my problem.
There was nothing in the atmosphere of the North Star to put me on my guard...
You'd pay me for that?
What?
Are you two all right? Did you see that!? They left! We made it! I think we made it!
One keg of Beast for the basement, then, truck's dry.
We'll be food, dickheads!
Where's the tunnel?
Any more ideas Animal Planet?
All right!  Tell us about the truck!
You wanna see, baby?
How much you got?
What's that!? Wha'cha say? Huh?
Blow the goddamn hatch!
SHIT.
Hey!
Okay, well that's something.
Shut up! Shut your mouth. You have no idea what is running through me right now. No idea.  I'm ready.
And on top of her political activities, now she's got a lawyer. She wants out of her contract, Mr. Bebe. She says she's through with motion pictures.
Excuse me, sir?
That's not all, Frances. Mr. Bebe is very concerned about your politics. He hears you've been donating money, speaking at rallies.
I'm sorry, Frances. It's my job, you know?
You don't think I'm good enough?
Who?
A rich actress.
But... but wait a minute. We're supposed to be different, right? Clifford says... This theatre is supposed to be different! And this play... this play is all about what greed and money do to people!
What does Clifford say?
Does Clifford even know?  You didn't tell him, did you?  I'm gonna tell him. Where is he?
No. Cut this runaround, Doctor. I know better.
You... I'm sorry, forgive me. Doctor, tell me honestly, what do I have to do to get out of here?
...I see.
What do I do, Dad?
Of course.
If I didn't, I wouldn't put you through it.
You're poisoning that child's mind.
You've sacrificed?! If you'd practice law for decent folk instead of Communists and indigents --
How? What do they do for you, Kaminski and his friends? They're all anarchists! Traitors!
Just one minute...
How ya doin', Farmer?
Harry? Harry, where are you?!
I called your god-damned office! I want you to kill him, Harry. You'll do that for me, won't you? I loved him, I loved him... that bastard.
Where are we, mean man?
I should've known...
This is another one of your schemes to get me off alone...
I love you, Harry. I love you.
Where you goin'?
Yeah, I know what that's like... Where you been?
'But how do I know you love me?'
'How do I know it's true? You'll get to be the champ. They'll all want you, all the girls! But I don't care. I've been undersea a long time. When they'd put their hands on me I used to say, "This isn't it! This isn't what I mean!" It's been a mysterious world for me! But Joe, I think you're it! I don't know why, I think you're it. Take me home with you.'
And here's one from nice Mr. Zeiss. He says that...
Well, they needed immediate answers, Frances. It's good manners and good sense. You shouldn't be bothering yourself with these right now.
It's your fan mail, little sister.
What?
Haven't you heard what I said?
I'm not cured. I was never sick! They had no business putting me in there! My only responsibility is to myself now!
No!
Mama, shut up!
Oh! Are you really?
I don't know why they even bother. She's had enough of this to knock sense into a bull elephant.
I checked the files. This one holds the record for shock treatments. Four hundred seventeen and no end in sight.
Yeah, well, you know doctors. They sure hate to use that word.
Why, Victor? Why? What were you thinking?
What of my soul? Do I have one? Or was that a part you left out?  Who were these people of which I am comprised? Good people? Bad people?
That's the nature of all progress, William. Don't let your brother sway you otherwise.
Are you sure it can't hurt us?
You make me weak.
It's going to ram us.
Rich old ladies and their daughters?
Quite a few.
Thank God your fever broke.  Slowly, now. Just a sip.  I've been worried we might lose you. It's been touch-and-go for a week.
We feared cholera. Turned out to be pneumonia, brought on by nervous exhaustion and some idiot running around in a storm.
Mine and Professor Krempe's.  We've been trading off nursing you in shifts. The rest of the time we're out working with the cholera victims. It's his turn for that just now.
We catch a few hours sleep where we can. Usually here at your bedside.
You seem to be adapting well to the approved curriculum.
Do you share my madness?
I think we should go wake them up. Just in case.
You think you're gonna last all summer?
How the... did he get in there?
What's the matter with it?
Somebody's there, Barry.
Let's go back, Barry...
You just had some lucky shots.
Jack?
Are you wet?
I have six new counsellor up there. They're all babes in the woods in every sense of the word.
How much do I owe you?
I mean...
Oh, Seth, how can I ever make it up to you?
Twenty-eight.
Why did they block the door again?
If he touches her, I'll kill him. I don't give a fuck how many guns you have, nothing will stop me from killing him.
Now, is your shit together?
Dad, when I called the machine to check our messages there was one from Bethel Baptist. Mr. Franklin said he wouldn't permanently replace you until we came back. He said when we come home, if you still feel the same way --
I didn't want to talk about this in front of Scott because he gets upset. But you don't believe in God anymore?
It's just, all our lives you've been a pastor. For twenty years you've preached trust in the lord. And then one day you wake up and say fuck him?
That happens, you'll get it back.
What do you think Mom would say?
What?
Mexico.
How many bullets left, kid?
What do you want from me? I did what you said.
He comes in here every day and we bullshit. He's used my toilet a thousand times. If I told him no, he'd know something was up.
Yeah?
Gotcha!
What'd ya mean, what? The fuckin' woman, the hostage. Where the fuck is she, Richard!?
Far out.  Where are my glasses?
Oh, fuck, Seth, that's my only pair!
What dya mean, don't worry about it. Of course I'm gonna worry about it, I can't fuckin' see.
Yeah, like a Mexican hole-in-the- wall's gonna have my fuckin' prescription.
They take you away to San Clemente Island.  Half the guys quit when they come back.  Supposed to be just hell-and-a-half.
Can I ask you somethin', lieutenant? How come you're doing this?  I mean, we're kinda curious.
Sir, I just want you to know... I'm not here to make a statement.  I don't want to make men look foolish. All I care about is completing the training and getting operational experience -- just like everyone else, I suspect.
I'm saying, we're just friends.
Sir, please... if there's any way to do this without dragging everyone through the mud...
White House boys want a private meeting.
Jordan.  I always hoped we'd get together -- though just now I'm gearing up for a child-care vote that --
Really don't wanna be captured, el- tee.  Heard some bad things.
Thank you, sir.  But I like these just fine.
I'll try anyway, sir.
Well, you're doin' shit-hot at Intel.
She's haze grey and underway...
So dump on me.
Well, guess I don't even need to be here...
You're such a ball-breaker sometimes.  Especially at night.
I'll try to keep the door open.  If you wash out, I make it so that --
I don't feel like doing an option paper on the rest of my life, Jordan.  Maybe we should just let it happen.
Sounded lame as soon as it came out of my mouth.  But I'm trying to be honest, okay?  Three years is a long time.  Don't ask me to predict how I'll feel then, Jordan, because I don't know.  And either do you.
"Wickwire, Thomas Dane"... Second run at Coronado... and correct, they had him stashed in the "Appropriation Liaison Office," whatever that is.
I'd sure like to know who.
I'm sorry, O'Neil.  But as class officer, it's my obligation to report all violations.
Females in combat situations impact unit cohesion.  Men fight better without women around.  And that is an historical fact.
O'Neil...
Can't live with them, can't kill them.  What's the point?
I like that image.
What are you doing?
So you made it.
Circuits are overloaded.
Did Romeo have a name?
Hi. Nick Tatopoulos...
When we learned he could burrow his way through the tunnels we realized he could be out of the quarantined zone.
Only five, Sir. We've checked them all. He hasn't used any of them.
And how should we do that, Sir?
Somebody must have seen it.
Are you looking for this?
I think we should leave now.
Sir, it's you  Thank Ipthar!
I avoided capture using the Mak'tar stealth haze.  Where is everyone?
At ease men.
"Purple skinned monstrosity...?"
Sense memory. I see you got to win the fight...
You were holding it upside down weren't you?
You know, with the makeup and everything1 I actually thought he was smart for a second.
WE'VE HAVE TO STOP!
Commander, please settle a dispute that my crew and I are having. In "The Quasar Dilemma", the Sentient had taken control of the ship's guidance systems, however-
No, wait, are you-
Shit! Go!
Systems register functional.
You Okay, Alex?
I am SO SICK of being right.
Hi everybody.
It's Jason...
Can it be repaired?
Wait, the pig lizard is gone. Why are they still chanting for the pig lizard?
You gotta admit, they do love him.
Yes... Hi Sarris... How are you doing?
Commander... Welcome to the Protector II.  Would you like to don your uniform?
A thousand apologies. We have failed you.
Where?
All right guys... Uh... Gwen and I are going to have to get to the core and shut it down manually. Fred, you and Guy need to get that air valve back on.  Alex, see if you can get the prison doors open downstairs in case Fred and Guy can't get the oxygen back in time.
Well, now there's something worth dying for.  What do you think?
What do you think, George, shall I resign?  It's what they want.
These men were taken from their homes at night, tried by Reed's courts -- which Congress recognizes -- and, well, you can see.
General Lee, welcome back.  I'm happy you've decided to join us.
They're among the best divisions the British have.  No conscripts, no impressed recruits, just professional killers.
George, remember that night when we were drinking with Arnold?
He warned you some day you might have to act for the good of the people -- even if it was against Congress.  George, the time has come for you to declare yourself king of America.  Listen to me, the whole army would rise up as one and place you on a throne!  George, you must declare yourself with us or against us.
If he supports the British why is it that every time he gets near them he kills so many of them?  Unlike General Lee... who you and Congress backed for second in command and who is a goddamned incompetent!
Congress is bitterly opposed to allowing Negroes in the army!
Unofficially, General Greene.
Arnold is indispensable, do you understand?  I need Arnold to help me win this war!
My God!  Who ordered this retreat?!
Martha... what?
To win this war I need an army.
What's the point of a revolution if it doesn't?
Is that why you come in here tossing pennies to my starving men? It's damned condescending!
They're just disgusting, jealous, bottom-feeding swine.  It's their nature.
You remember, George, when we were 'studying' the great philosophers?
Well, I remember a philosopher who said something that I used to think was just another of those stupid class denouncements... but which I now see means us all.
Do you?  When I saw those men yesterday in the field... and the women and children in those hovels? I'm not so sure if America is as far from England as I'd hoped.
Is it?  Well, I'm scared of what we've become in our freedom.
The land here is best for grain and corn.
Listen, tonight, later on, I got one for you doesn't involve any heavy work. I want you to go have a look around Chili Palmer's hotel room.
Who?
Whoa... This is the man used to jump offa high buildings?
Bear. The Colombians are in L.A. Seems they all upset about their money. That ain't enough, as a bonus, it turns out the yoyo was Escobar's nephew.
I don't know how I could've missed you with that shirt on. It's the same as the other one you had only the hibiscus are a different color. Right?
You think I'd be standing here? You set somebody up and you want it to work, it has to be a surprise. Can you remember that?
But first I want to know who I'm talking to. Am I talking to you, or am I talking to him?
I can't believe the way you guys do business out here. I can't believe how fucked up your organization is.
Bo. I'm great. Listen, I'm expecting some people -
I'm working on a few things.
You get to town, you go straight to the bank, raid the limo account.
Who the fuck are you?
Did you stop to think what if I had a heart attack?
Keep going.
Two time academy award nominee, Martin Weir.
One of his best parts.
Here's your keys, Harry.
Which also means when I speak, I'm speakin' for Jimmy. So e.g. as of now, you start affording me the proper respect.
Bullshit. E.g. is short for 'ergo'.
So when do I meet up with the husband and give him the look?
It's not one of these?
You been here the whole time?
So what about your story. You thought of a title yet?
How 'bout Chili's Hollywood Adventure.
You okay?
I told you not to -
I'm not sure how I feel about this, Doris.
I mean morally. Murray was my friend.
Harry, we spoke with Martin.
Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior. This is United States Coastguard Station North Island. Over.
Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. What type of vessel?
How about now?
What? You sure?
When they find out what it's carrying, they may not be so interested in what's legal.
Seeing as though a foot of one of these fuckers weighs about a hundred pounds, it ain't gonna be what you'd call easy.  Any questions?
Fifty million dollars. Fifty million. We gonna let this guy just take it from us? One guy?
You aren't jealous, are you Dodge?
It's a hell of a lot of money.
I say fuck the motherfucker. We're a professional salvage crew going about our business. What's some yahoo doing way out here by himself anyway?
So. I got a question. Just from a, you know, purely technical standpoint. We call the Coastguard.  Coastguard shows up. What exactly is the plan?
Well, they're gonna be asking a lot of questions. About us. About those bodies. About the gold. Seems like we oughta be prepared is all.
Yeah, well. The truth is one thing. When there's more than a few hundred million dollars involved, that's a whole new deal.
Tomorrow we'll see if we can't find some line and tackle. Use some of those bodies below decks for bait.
What'd he look like?
Coffee?
Got your light?
"Their lacking diligence has undoubtedly caused the collision. Distress calls have been made."
The page's missing. Then their SOS was real.
Maybe the other ship took the worst of it.
Murphy to Epps.
The number nine on the starboard side's half flooded. Epps says it's a slow leak just under the waterline, about twenty gallons an hour. They must've pumped it before we left Sitka.
Let the buyer beware.
All we got to do is hit some rough weather and you can forget about it.
Greer?
Oh, man.
What seems to be the trouble, ladies?
Pumpkin? What's wrong?
Hey... so, what brings you down here?
What are you trying to say?
What the hell is wrong with you?!
Well lose it! And why aren't you pushing the large sizes? Didn't you get training about upsizing?
It's not optional!
Hi Josh.
I just stopped in to say hi.
Just think, we'll never have to see any of these creepy faces ever again.
Shut up!
What? Why?
"Authentic 50's diner"? Since when were there mini-malls in the 1950's?
Look at how cute I am!
It's obviously him!
Ew, look at this...
I think it's cute - look at his little weasel teeth.
JOSH!
Give me all your money, bitch!
You won't believe it! Guess!
Anthony's II!
Just now... I went with Seymour.
Do you want to do something tonight?
Well, are we still going shopping tomorrow?
There.
I'm gonna finish packing tonight... I'll bring it over tomorrow sometime.
I dunno...
May I ask what you're doing?
I want to know what you think you're doing, staying out all night and worrying your father to death!
Well, if it isn't Enid and Rebecca, the little Jewish girl and her Aryan friend.
Fine, and how are you?
Yeah, it took a while before I got a chance to play it, but when I heard that song it was like --
Yeah, that's good too... the whole record was good, but that one song, "Devil Got My Woman" -- I mostly just keep playing that one over and over... Do you have any other records like that?
Wow!
Yeah, sure, I guess...
Wow! Look at all these creeps!
What the fuck, Seymour?! What is this?
What, are you a klansman or something?
"Four-piece Cook's special deep fried with side n' slaw it's OUT RAY-GEOUS"!
Boo!
God, she's going to kill me... this bottle is half-empty!
If you expect the worst, you're never disappointed.
I'm just being realistic.
I hate sports.
You're a beautiful young girl... I can't imagine you would ever have had any interest in me, except as an amusingly cranky eccentric curiosity.
I mean... of course I... why wouldn't I want to go out with you?
Yeah, sure. Of course.
What about Joe?
I agree.
-oh, sing a different song, Abdullah-  -there's nothing wrong with your men so stop telling me there is-
Pleasant journey?
Understand, I had help-
Go, now.  Such a gentleman. 
I couldn't believe it when you said "sort it out." As if it were the most normal thing in the world. "Ho-hum, what lovely tea, I think I'll bag a killer beast this evening, nothing much else going on anyway."
Second death? Where?-
It would have been a beautiful bridge, John. I never noticed before, occupied with other business, I suppose...  ...never really pay much attention to that kind of thing but I've had the time today, nothing else on, and this... it's graceful and the placement couldn't be prettier... and... 
Did it look like this in your mind?
He has children?
Oh, yes, I got in a little late this morning, Janosz.
We'll do the happiness index next.  I'd like to bring Ray in on your case, if it's all right with you.
Oh no.
Occasionally
Venkman?  I think he was borderline for a while there.  Then he crossed the border.
That's where the buggy stopped.
Be careful on that sofa -- it's a butt-biter. But the bed's good and I just changed the sheets so if you get tired, feel free.  In fact, I think you should definitely plan on spending the night here.
For me it's best if I sleep on my side and you spoon up right behind me with your arms around me.  If we go the other way I'm afraid your hair will be getting in my face all night.
Or we could do that.
Is this the spot?
Who are you going to call?
It's a painting I'm restoring for the new Byzantine exhibition.  It's a self-portrait of Prince Vigo, the Carpathian.  He ruled most of Carpathia and Moldavia in the 17th Century.
Keep that up, mister, and I'll find you in contempt.
Hey!  Wait!  Okay, I'll meet you there.
"Vigo the Carpathian, born 1505, died 1610 --"
Seems like a pretty open-minded guy, huh?
There's definitely something going on in that studio.  The PKE levels were max-plus and the Giga-meter was showing all red.
Geez, I forgot how heavy these things are.
What happened?
Vigi, Vigi, Vigi -- you have been a bad little monkey.
Now that's one ugly dude.
You finished here?
Are you all right?  You coming down with something?
And pure --
Well, I guess some people have it and some don't.
Is that your professional opinion?
Great rehearsal.
You're the best one in your row.
I don't have to take abuse from you.  I have other people dying to give it to me.
Who's the stiff?
Well, that definitely looks like marshmallow to me.
You have to wonder why anybody would dump a marshmallow that size right in the middle of the street.
Thank you for coming so quickly.  The guests are starting to ask questions and I'm running out of excuses.
Well, most of the original staff knows about the twelfth floor ... The disturbances, I mean ... But it's been quiet for years ... Up until two weeks ago ... It was never ever this bad, though.
Heavens, no!  The owners don't like us to even talk about it.  I hoped we could take care of this quietly tonight.
Nervous?
Well, just 75 more to go.  What's this one?
Something was definitely here.
You know, Peter, this could be a past life experience intruding on the present.
Excuse me for a minute.  Ray, I'm right in the middle of something here.  Can you come back in about an hour?
Sure.  That's great, Ray.  I think you should get down there right away and check it out.  Let me know what happens.
Wow!  Does this pole still work?
Egon, how's the grid around the storage facility holding up?
Stantz?  You okay in there?
Those are priceless sculptures.
Damn him!  I should have killed him on the front -- I let you talk me out of that.
Where is my family?
Gladly, Caesar.  And, if you'd like we can take you for a tour of the front at first light.
You won an impossible fight.  You got the attention of the crowd, legate...
The Senate too?
To think I brought my daughters up on all things Roman.  Read to sleep on Catullus, Lucretius... Virgil... every night.  My beautiful daughters.
What the hell was all that about?
Why don't we try to keep politics out of the conversation.
You need to come home!
The battle is over.  The war is over.  You've won!
Take your hands off me animal!
You put this inside your shirt -- when Tiger stabs your stomach -- it's full of pig's blood.  Gushes out everywhere!  It's really impressive.  Fantastic!  Better than the real thing!
You get to come alive again in the country!
The point is you get to fight the easy country circuit, the small arenas, relax, live the good life!
But -- you have to go out there! I'll give you more than your one third!  When I get paid... just take the fall!  You're too hurt to fight and the man's a killer!
Aren't you eating?
Why not?
Listen, Elaine -- it seems to me that there isn't a bar in here. I mean -- as far as I know.
Elaine --
Why?
Benjamin?
Are we getting married tomorrow?
The day after tomorrow?
You're not one of those agitators?
One of those outside agitators.
I'm putting it here by the door.
I'd rather not.
Is it a girl?
Whatever it is you're upset about.
In general.
Are you always this much afraid of being alone?
Well, why can't you just lock the doors and go to bed?
I really don't want to put this on again. Won't you bring it up?
Did you get us a room?
Have you gotten us a room yet?
Do you want to?
Do you want me to get it?
Do you want to get it now?
Yes.
Why don't you get it.
Can I take off my clothes now?
Do you really want me to?
Don't talk about Elaine.
No.
Now listen -- this was not my idea. It was my father's idea.
Look, we'll go out to dinner and have a drink and I'll bring her back. Because it was either that or a dinner party for the two families. And I'm afraid I couldn't quite handle that, if you don't mind. I have no intention of ever taking your precious daughter out again in her life. So don't get upset about it.
Braddock -- Braddock?
I'll find your table in a moment. Braddock. Not Braniff? We have a Braniff.
I'm afraid I don't understand.
I'm going up to Berkeley today.
I drove -- I drove Mrs. Robinson home. She wanted me to drive her home so I -- I drove her home.
She's upstairs. She wanted me to wait down here till you got home.
Hello.
Yes?
Yes?
Benjamin -- where are you?
Turn 'em up.
I've quit.
I'm not going to get those pearls and neither are you.
I'll pay you back.
I have an idea working in my head... 
Flaemmchen, what are you doing here in the middle of the night.
You live here?
Oh!
Well -- such is life, Flaemmchen.
There.
And this is Doctor Otternschlag.
Is that too much, Baron?
All right then.
Pardon me, the lady has urgent business here with me.
Madam Grusinskaya -- at once --
Barman -- whiskey --  For you, Mr. Kringelein?
Her master's voice!  I must go now -- goodbye -- thanks.
I'm engaged for the evening.
How do you know there is a Grand Hotel?
Moreover... He was a lucky man -- that man.
You are late. I've been waiting for you -- waiting.
You're sweet.
Now to proceed with the projected merger, the advantages for the Saxonia are so obvious...
...and let me say again for the tenth time...  ...you people were quite ready for the merger. You declared yourselves... fully agreed on all the terms -- Why should the signing of these articles be suddenly held up?
Ah, oui -- the car is here for Madam.
I suppose I can cancel the Vienna engagement.
I wish you a very good evening, Mr. Preysing. You are staying here, too, Mr. Preysing?
How is the house?
If the house is empty again, I don't know --
Well, I guess so. You're the guy I work for.
Not skimming a thing, Lilly?
That's right. Take a little, leave a little.
You're a thousand percent right!
You know it, Lilly.
Yeah? You really think so? A lot of people been telling me the same thing.
Worries about his mother, eh? Give him a hug for me.
Well. If Mary Beth vouches for you, and if she told you the story already...
The ambulance is on the way, for what good it will do.
Mrs. Dillon, your son was in some sort of accident. He's had an internal hemorrhage, he's bleeding to death inside.
His blood pressure is under a hundred. I don't think he'll live to get to the hospital.
When I said you being the best salesman here didn't say much, I meant for us. I know your record with Sarber and Webb, and I'd say you're a top-flight man, but you've had no incentive. No one walking on your heels. Just a lot of half asses, so the tendency's been not to stretch yourself. I'm bouncing the slobs, incidentally.
Makes no difference to me if they're only on commission. If they don't make good money, they're not giving us good representation, and we can't afford to have them around. Ever supervise salesmen?
What happened to your hand?
I can take care of my own bills, Lilly.
What are you talking about? So I've got a job. So what?
It's there. The boss called, you said so yourself.
If you come out to the track, don't know me.
I'm sorry. I hated to take your money, but --
Roy... What if I told you I wasn't really your mother? That we weren't related?
You aren't taking me for granted, are you?
What if we want to drive somewhere while we're there?
I still don't see why we have to have separate rooms. You expect your father to come through?
Things a man isn't supposed to know.
Roy Dillon?
Lieutenant Pierson, Phoenix police. I have a car here.
One set of muddy shoe prints.
Detective Carter from the Haddonfield P.D.
Nothing to fear.  The coast is clear.
Totally.  I checked all the rooms and closets...
Don't think so.  But they sure did a real number on your office. Crap everywhere.
You some kind of fugitive or something?
What are you doing here?!
I can see that.  Why?
Are you crazy?  You'll get caught.
Then I'll get caught.
There's something I have to tell you both.  It's going to sound strange...
My name hasn't always been Keri Tate.  It was once Laurie Strode.
Fuckin' A.
Hold on, hot lips.  We got work to do.
No, Mom -- keep it on!
He crept up these stairs and made his way into this room.  His sister's room. Right here. Where it all began.
This house is sacred to him.  It's the source of his memories -- his rage.  Mrs. Strode, I beg you.  Don't let your family suffer the same fast as Laurie and her daughter.
It was there when I found him this morning.  It looks like some kind of letter or number or --
We need you, Dr. Loomis.
Come now, Sam.  This is a gathering of old friends.  I know how difficult this must be for you -- a man of your upbringing and integrity -- but now that I'm in charge I felt it was only fair that you finally know the truth.  After all, you're the only one around here who's still in the dark, as it were.  This isn't the way I wanted to tell you, but you've really given me no other choice.
Your madness is another man's greatness.  This is the way things have always been.  You've just been too blinded by your own reality to see.  But having you on the outside has been convenient for us in many ways.  You always did come through -- our loyal watch dog. Finding him. Bringing him back to us once he'd finished his work.  Although after you had that nasty stroke the last time, I had to go after him myself.  And what a terrible time we had getting him out of that jail cell.
Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.
She has the gift -- the blood of Thorn running through her veins.  Michael's mother had it, too.  So for six years I incubated her, prepared her for this night.  Michael has served his purpose.  And soon we will have a new progeny.
There you go trying to make sense again.  It's a curse.  Handed down through countless generations. As ageless as this celebration which you call Halloween.
It appears that we're going to have to wait awhile for any more action here, Colonel.  Why don't you run on home while the evening's young.
Home is important to a man.
No.
Um.
I suppose.
What's funny about that?
Are we really going to find out where the elephants go to die?
Would somebody please pass me the catsup?
Mhravitch.  Remember that name.
The name will live forever.  It was there that Harold Ryan slew the Beast of Yugoslavia.  Mhravitch.
It's rather a disappointment these days.  It isn't there any more.
The Germans shot everybody who lived there, then leveled it, plowed it, planted turnips and cabbages in the fertile ground. They wished revenge for the slaying of the Beast of Yugoslavia.  To their twisted way of thinking, your father had butchered an Eagle Scout.  Play lots of contact sports?
You're supposed to get hurt!
Does it bother you to have your mother engaged to a man like that?
He seems to think they are.  He told me that were.
You're a very good boy to respond that way.
I'd like to use the sanitary facilities, if I may.
Mom?
Bluh.
Now--turn around, if you would.
Things.
I'm turning off the alarm.  I'm turning off everything.
I want you to get out of here, Norbert.  Harold--I want you to sit down in the chair, and not lift a finger until Norbert is gone.
I mean it!
Look--I'm sorry--I have to go.
Look--this isn't my apartment, and there isn't anybody else here.  Mrs. Ryan won't be home for a while.
You can also describe its cure. I'm eating its cure.
Pacqualinincheewa root.
Pacqualinincheewa root.  Means "cougar fang." Cures anything but a yellow streak down the back.
Congratulations.  By crossing twenty-eight feet of cockroach- infested carpet, you've become the third white man ever to hear of it.
I haven't told you, Harold, how comical I think you are.
Dead!
Alice is dead?
For what?
Who's dead?
What happened?
How horrible.
That goes double for me.
I feel like I want to yell my head off--just yell anything.  Bulllllllllllllll-dickey!
What are his symptoms?
What does he say to do?
Yes?
This conversation took place, incidentally, about three months before Harold was declared legally dead.
I'm touched.
I see.
I am Dr. Norbert Woodly--a physician, a healer.  I find it disgusting and frightening that a killer should be a respected member of society.  Gentleness must replace violence everywhere, or we are doomed.
Get out of here.
If he'd just get into scouting, and camp out some, and see how everybody roughhouses around the fire--
You're still dressed?
Is this all the display space we can get?
Are you a private detective?
Here? What a joke. There was some detective asking about that girl.
This is just temporary. I once made nine hundred in outcall.
Up front?
Make it nine hundred. That was my best week.
When do we start?
Be that as it may. U is for Unconditional Election. God has chosen a certain number of people to be saved, The Elect, and He has chosen them from the beginning of time. L is for Limited Atonement. Only a limited number will be atoned, will go to Heaven.
I can stop if you want.
Did you find out where she was?
What happened?
Oh, fuck off. You should stay where you belong.
Is Marsha there?
What do you want?  Do I know you from somewhere?
No. I walked up. Don't ride elevators.
Yes.  I'm interested in financing an adult feature film. I was told you were the man to come to.
You know Granville's looking for you, Niki?
Granville's looking for you anyway.
The guy who bought you that ring.
Lady, you were going 70 miles an hour in a 45-mile zone. Could I see your license, please?
Yes.
Come again.
How long have you been driving?
Could I see your registration?
Isn't this your vehicle?
Took it?
Your tree.
Lady, let me get this straight.
Here's your shovel.
Harold?
Why do you say that?
What's that?
What were you fighting for?
I like Glaucus.
Well, I really don't smoke.
I'm sure picking up on vices.
Did Confucius say that?
You are the wisest person I know.
Yes. I haven't lived.  I've died a few times.
Died! Seventeen times - not counting maiming.  Shot myself in the face once with a popgun and a pellet of blood.
Well, it's a question of timing, and the right equipment, and plenty of patience... You really want to hear about this?
Don't you talk to me like that, you little foul mouth degenerate!  Really, sir, I thought that you at least...
I was remembering how much this meant to me. It was after the war... I had nothing... except my life. How different I was then - and yet how the same.
Love? Love? What do you <u>know</u> about her? Where does she come from? Where did you meet her?
Oh... That's wonderful... I get an eighty-year-old pallbearer for a daughter-in-law! Be reasonable, Harold! You're dealing with your life! What will people say?!
I don't think I'm getting through to Mother like I used to.
Yes. It does.
I put a lot of effort into these things.
And a lot of time.
No.
My mother spoke to my Uncle Victor. He's in the Army and he fixed it up.
You mean when I'm not working on a...
Will they really teach me to shoot?
And to use the bayonet? PACHOIE!
How about hand-to-hand combat?
To strangle someone. Choke him. Squeeze out his life between your hands.
How about to slit his throat?
I'd like that. You could see the blood squirt out.
Sir, how about souvenirs?
Of your kill - ears, nose, scalp, privates.
Oh. No Boxes. Such a shame.
I knew you'd come back.
What?
What do you mean?
You DIDN'T tell me. Do you mean Malahide's got...
I... remember.
Don't get psychic with me.
hound of resurrection --
It's almost over!!
It's her choice --  She's human --
At nineteen hundred hours an alarm tripped. B&E. Robbery. Six guards dead --
You will never fulfill your destiny. You will never understand the power inside you.
Whatcha looking at, John??
Myers, you're a talker. What's a good word -- a solid word for "need" --
Nah, sounds too "needy."
Hi.
Hello, I'm --
Yes, I --
Pardon?
Oh.
Lucky man.
We've got such sights to show you --
Oh my God.
...somebody...
You can't love him.
So where's the harm?
How long since you were here?
How are you doing through there?
Just a moment. Put on some music will you babe?
Not much fun, is it?
Drinking alone.
Why don't you do the same?
I thought you were going to stay with us for awhile?
You'd like the house.
Would you... maybe call round sometime? Try to make friends.
I'm here.
What?
What did I say?
Nice, Barry.
You just drove a fucking customer away, Barry.
Not the point.
I don't want you talking to our customers like that again.
I'd think you were a cinematic idiot. And I'd feel sorry for you.
I'm sorry, Rob, but I'm struggling here.  I don't understand any part of this conversation.  You're asking me what I would think if you told me that you hadn't seen a film that you've seen.  What am I supposed to say?
"-- I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet," yeah, yeah, I hear you --
What's up?
That is perverse.  Do not tell anyone you don't own fucking Blonde on Blonde.  What about Television?
Okay, okay -- "Leader of the Pack." The guy fucking cracks up on a cycle and dies right? "Dead Man's Curve," Jan and Dean...
Hey Charlie.
Why did you break up with me for Marco?
Huh?
Rob.
Can I help you?
You used to care more about things like Marvin Gaye than you do now. When I first met you, and I made you that tape, you loved it.  You said -- and I quote -- "It was so good it made you ashamed of your record collection."
So you weren't interested in music at all?
Well if you could tell me roughly it would help.
Yeah.  Great.
No problem.  If I can ask one question.
It sounds stupid.
You won't like it.
Is it better?
Well.  Sex, I guess.  Is sex with him better?
Of course it is.
I don't know.
Never?
But not even before, when he was living upstairs?
The sleeping together is better but not the sex because you haven't done it was him yet.
This is where you're supposed to say that you haven't laughed this much in ages, and then you see the error of your ways.
You know I'm a good person.
You know that I can cook my ass off when I feel like it.
I can see why you say that.  Look, I'm sorry.  I really am.  The last thing I wanted was... that's why I left, because... I lost it, and I didn't want to blow my top in there, and... look, the reason I fucked everything up was because I was scared.  I just wanted you to know, that's all.
What do you mean?
Sure, I understand.  Look, I don't want to take up any more of your time.  You get back, and I'll wait here for a bus.
What do you want to do?
Look, Rob.  If great sex was as important as you think it is, and if I was having great sex with him, then we wouldn't be lying here now. And that is my last word on the subject, okay?
What are you going to talk to me about?
Ha ha ha.  Hoo hoo hoo.
I know.
I'm sorry.  But two days ago you were in love with that girl who interviewed you for The Reader, weren't you?
Well forgive me if I don't think of you as the world's safest bet.
No.  Probably not.
Don't sulk.  What brought all this on?
Very persuasive.
No.  I don't think so.  I'm just curious about how one goes from making tapes for one person to marriage proposals to another in two days. Fair enough?
So?
About what?
I've changed my mind.  That's the most romantic thing I've ever heard. I do.  I will.
I mean, maybe you're right.  But were you really expecting me to say yes?
Hi, Marie.
Which way are you going?
That way.
I'll call you.
Eno import.  Sigue Sigue Sputnik. Break beats.  Serge Gainsbourg. Ryuchi Sakamoto, Syd Barrett... What's going on here?  Are you guys stealing for other people now?
I warned you.
Do you play?
What will you do now?
He called you "MacLeod".
I left a man dead in Felton.  But you don't really care, do you?
He was innocent.
What about me?
I'm a witness to a murder.  That seems to put me pretty high on your friend's chop list.
No.
I'd rather hear yours.
I'm a historian, Mr. Taupin. Only once in a lifetime do you stare history in the face.
Maybe it would do us both good.
Don't.
Aren't you getting a little old for this?  You flunked out of law school.
Hang on a sec, you did your little favor for the boys downtown, I'm sure your uncle and the rest are perfectly capable of taking it from here.
When I was a boy a cart driven by a drunken fool crushed me.  All thought I would die or be maimed for life.  But I healed quickly. And like you I paid the price for being different.
Do you ever feel a flow, as if some- thing were pushing against you?
Does it change with me in the room?
You feel you know me.
Impotent cow.
If you send me away now, Mara, I'll not come looking for you.
Eat up Dupont.  It will probably be your last.
Here.  The hook should go just below the head, where the meat is toughest.
Old habits die hard.  Waitress!  A round of Nitzhic!  Peasant drool, I know.  But it's the closest thing they stock to my side of the fence.
You've been here from the start.
Do you make a habit of hanging out in that neigh- borhood at night?
Hello, Harvard! Got anything new on the hanging?
I got my rhyming dictionary in -- 
All right, dear.
The five hundred? Sure.
But --
But I don't gamble, Hilda!
All right.  One -- two -- three -- four -- five. Five hundred. Be careful, honey.
Hildy! Where's mother?
Did you give her the money?
Then suppose you give me the money. Four hundred and fifty dollars.
I know I wasn't a good husband, Hildy, but you can always count on me.
I don't know. This makes me feel funny.
I feel I ought to take care of her.
Well, I'm independent, too.
Well, of course, if you put it that way.
I'm beginning to realize that.
Gee, you almost make me feel like a heel -- coming between you.
I know how you feel, Bruce, but you've got to forgive her. She's only a woman, after all.
Ts! Ts! Ts!
I'll find her, Bruce, if I have to put every detective in the city on the job. Tell you what -- go over to the Missing Persons Bureau and describe your mother. What does she look like?
Call Duffy!
Was it my fault? Did I know that coal mine was going to have another cave-in? I meant to be with you on our honeymoon, Hildy -- honest I did.
Deny it! I'm proud of it! We beat the whole country on that story.
Let's not fight, Hildy. Tell you what. You come back to work on the paper and if we find we can't get along in a friendly way, we'll get married again.
I haven't any hard feelings.
Sure, come on. We'll have some lunch and you can tell me everything.
You can break it, can't you?
Sure you can. Come on.
What do you mean by that?
You mean you're not coming back to work here?
You've had a better offer, eh?
Well, go on and take it. Work for somebody else! That's the gratitude I get for --
What were you when you came here five years ago? A little college girl from a School of Journalism! I took a little doll-faced mugg --
Why should I? I thought it would be a novelty to have a face around here a man could look at without shuddering.
I made a great reporter out of you, Hildy, but you won't be half as good on any other paper, and you know it. You need me and I need you -- and the paper needs both of us.
It would have worked if you'd been satisfied with just being editor and reporter. But no! You had to marry me and spoil everything.
Well, you practically did! Making goo-goo eyes at me for two years till I broke down. And I still claim I was tight the night I proposed. If you'd been a gentleman you'd have forgotten all about it. But not you!
What now?
You said it.
Not if he's inside the desk. We'll carry the desk over.  Give me Duffy!
Bruce ought to be back by now. Walter, you're not trying anything again, are you?
Don't open that!
The greatest yarn ever written by anybody. My hat's off to you, Hildy!
And what a way to quit. While you're still champion! That's the way to leave, Hildy!
What do you mean? Bruce'll be waiting for you in Albany.
Where'd you wire him?
Sure.
Both jobs are open, Hildy. The paper -- and being Mrs. Walter Burns.
Sure, it was good -- it was wonderful! Only you expected it to be like other marriages. It can't be like other marriages -- we're different! We're a different world. Look at what we went through today. I wouldn't trade that for any honeymoon in the world. I bet you wouldn't, either.
That's what makes it romantic. Every other married couple goes away on a honeymoon and for two weeks the bride knows just where the groom is, and vice versa. But us -- you never know where I am and I'm not sure where you are. That's Romance!
Hildy, if that's what you want, all right. We'll even go to -- how about Niagara Falls?
Sure I do. And I'll tell you something else -- I'd like a baby.
Sure, I can't last forever. I want a son I can train to take my place on this paper.
Well, if she looked like you -- Say! My brains and your looks -- that mightn't be such a bad combination.
What's the good of arguing about something that probably doesn't exist? Look, Hildy, I'm proposing to you. What do you say?
Down Western Avenue. We were going sixty-five miles an hour. You know what I mean?
Cooley, I want to talk to you.
Well, that about covers everything.
Better let us in on it, Mollie.
Oh, you two are pals now -- I think you're right, Endicott. Mollie did give her some kind of story.
Oh -- I'll take the same, I guess. And coffee.
Johnson, I'm going to the bottom of this. What do you know about Williams? Are you going to talk or aren't you?
Well, wait a minute, will you? I'm in conference.
No -- don't out me off.
And so do I!
Nobody's going to rush me into anything!  You keep away from me! 
Hello, Hildy. I thought you were gone.
Hiding him where?
Maybe you're my friend and maybe you're not -- but don't come any nearer. You can't trust anybody in this crazy world. Say, I'll bet I could shoot you from here.
What's that?
Now, listen. There's a fine opening for a fellow like you in the City Sealer's office.
The City Sealer's office!
Sure, Mollie, you never looked better in your life.
Can I try?
What are you doing here? This is our territory
Tell them about Pauline's mum.
Crocodiles! Aah!
Could you seal it over with hot pitch, Clive? Caulk it like the hull of a ship.
Don't panic!  Keep your head!
You mean they let you go through the officer training course and then said you were too old for a commission?
Why didn't they say that before you started?
What are you going to be then?
And where do you think you're going?
You go to bed this minute and take off that lipstick.
...such nice boys with straw boaters and blazers. All the punts lit up with Chinese lanterns. Like fireflies. And the gramophone going on one of the boats. Always the Charleston, the Charleston, the Charleston. Oh, you girls.
He could always make me laugh.
This war's put an end to decent things. I want to close my eyes and jump and give myself for once, hold nothing back.
Molly!
Ma, Tiny's in.
OK, whatever. Let's go get your brother's truck. Faster we get the truck, faster we get out of here.
I'd like to see that.
No, really.
The Duke?
You mean John Wayne?
Yeah, I was never that big of a western fan. I like science fiction.
You see me and my friends are writing a book on offbeat roadside attractions. You know all the crazy shit you see when you drive cross country.
But if you did.
But suppose for a second you did.
No, no I think it's really interesting.
What was that?
Fuck! We are fucked!
Sounds like a magical trip through the heartland.
How much is a person supposed to stand?
No, he's just joking. We don't really have any plans other than spending the night at my Dad's house...  ...which is where we were headed when our car broke down.
Fuck, it's freezing.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, so how does that fit with the story of four morons with a flat tire looking for a dead tree?
So.
Why?
Yeah?
So what?
You know what Jerry, who really cares at this point?
Come on sleeping beauty, time to go to work.
Rise and shine.
Let's go. You're the one who wanted to be a photographer.
Too late. You're in for life, let's move it out Private Shutterbug.
Aw, it ain't crap... it's... cute.  ...and really who are we to judge the artistic merit of the tin-can Mona Lisa?
What was that?
So, what brings you kids way out here, ain't you got something better to do for Halloween than wander around out here in the sticks?
Oh, really...  ...well, I'm a pretty good dancer if you know what I mean... I bet I got a few moves you ain't never seen.
God damn it, I must be fucking crazy to let him go off with that crazy fucking bitch.
That stupid hillbilly slut.
Behold... The Fish-Boy!
I'm the one who brings the devil's brandy... 
Tell it to my daughter.
Plates match.
Tell him, Harold.
No. Don't be. I really enjoy hearing that. You're a terrific assistant.
Well, I don't know. I'm actually on my way to...
No. Don't be silly. It's just...
Yeah. Okay. Be home around seven. Bye.  What? I'm sorry. What was I supposed to do?
You don't abandon somebody because they have a physical problem.
Well?
Please. I look a mess.
Anyway. Come already to the point.
I've moved on.
I've been seeing Johannsen in chemistry.
That's not how he tells it.
Hunh.
Very well.
How'd you know where I was?
Your brother should have his license revoked.
Boy, this is good!
No, I'm sorry. I'm really backward in certain areas.
You do?
You really enjoy my company?
Come on.
Everything's fine, honey. We don't need to talk. Besides I have to work late.
I'm going to go down and check on Puff. See how he's holding up.
Nah. You just relax. How's the book?
Did I? I tried so hard! I really concentrated! Oh, I'm so happy!
Extra dessert?
Wait!
You sure you going to be comfortable enough there, Miss... ah... ?
It always takes me a little while to get a name fixed in my mind. Are you sure you don't want anything?
You, uh, you ever been to Louisville during Derby week, Miss, ah, Packard?
In a little while. That's what you want, isn't it?
Hey, mister.
Sarah Packard... Bert Gordon.
What's the matter? What happened?
Eddie?...  YOU OWE ME MONEY!
Half.
Well, here it's half.
It's quiet.
Looks more like a morgue to me. Those pool tables are the slabs they lay the stiffs on.
Oh, I don't want to be no bother to nobody.
How do you want me to play it? I'm broke.
I thought we came here to play pool.
You sure you don't want to quit, friend?
Okay, friend. You're on.
It's the lights. And the scotch.
I wasn't waiting for a bus.
Same reason you went: at that hour of the morning you haven't much choice. Besides, I only live three blocks from there. Where do you live?
I know where you live: in a locker, in a bus station. What's it like living in a locker?
Do you always ask so many questions?
I'm hungry.
What did all this stuff cost you?
No, c'mon, I wanna know. I wanna keep score.
Don't you ever cook anything?
You can read it, if you want to.  You want to go out for a while? To a movie?
No. You?
Where's Bert?
Well, that old lovin' horse paid twenty-two forty.  Let's see... two hundred I won from the jockey last night. And today at the track... I got five hundred and forty bucks.  Here, you hold it.
Preach! Go down and get me some White Tavern whisky, a glass, and some ice.
How much do you remember?
Will you keep feeding me?  How long can you live like that?  Until it kills you?  Until I kill you? Without your blood I'll go back.
The more we plant, the more that'll grow, and the happier --
A meteorite, Dad, look!
Why, Dad?
I had an awful dream.
We'll be by to pick him up in ten minutes.
I swear it was here.
No.
You're looking for life?
Ms. Magnuson, is Jimmy Gardner with you?
Jimmy's father is on the phone.  I wonder if you'd take the call.
You still believe in him.
Better be. You left me for him.
You saved a lot of lives.
Okay, why did I just send my family to Atlanta?
Not really...
A countdown to what?
Sure he'll listen. Why wouldn't he?
You punched the President in the face?
Get us out of here!
And our forces?
More ships keep arriving, fifteen in total so far.
You're late.
That is an affirmative. I have victory dance. Mmmmmmm.
They let you out?
Call them back.
Yes.
Do you believe the Grail actually exists?
Indy... Indy, you must hurry!! Come quickly!
Are you expected?
Tapestries?
This is a castle. And we have many tapestries. But if you're a Scottish lord, then I am Mickey Mouse.
I'm through!
It must be one of these...
This one. I think he's in here.
It is you Junior!
But what are you doing here?
What am I looking for?
Feels like a cigarette lighter.
What did you get?
Those people are trying to kill us!
It's a new experience for me.
Elsa never really believed in the Grail. She thought she'd found a prize.
Sallah, I said no camels! That's five camels. Can't you Count?
Where's my father?
You're hanging on better here than you did in America.
The plane crash and your journey here sound -- most incredible.
Their stories are just fear and folklore.
What's that?
He was afraid of you. He knows a tough guy when he sees one.
That's far enough!
Look out, damn it, I need that antidote!
India...
Don't let it pull you deeper!
Don't let it curl around you!
The drawing shows a priest named Sankara who lived centuries ago.
It's Sanskrit. It tells the story of Sankara climbing Mt. Kalisa where he met the Hindu god Shiva.
Legend says he told Sankara to go forth and combat evil. To do that he gave him five sacred stones that had magical powers.
Yeah -- and nothing else.  That shock you?
There's bugs! Bugs all over! Help! Help me!
What?
I want to go home...
This is the first time anybody ever cried when I left.
Figures...
Al.
What are you doing?
What for?
Are you crazy?
Don't do it.  Don't aim at the head.
You're not crazy.
Of course you do!
What do I do?
They could put you back in the tube..
Well...they sure as hell aren't gonna get it for you.
Yeah...Who is?
You are CRAZY!
What do you mean we.
I did. I brought you back here.
Thanks.
You need ID in there?
I don't wanna be you. I wanna go home.
...and a license to kill...
Al, are you doing anything in there?
Where is she staying?
Much too blue.
Follow that busboy.
What Happened?
Come on, she's getting away.
I can't...
You sure this will work?
Well at least talk it up, then. I feel like an idiot.
Holy...
Not really. Truth is...I was ..jealous. Of you.
JOE What abilities...?
I'm against it.
Impossible.
Who is your friend?
Joe.
Take the card.
Don't do it!
...Blake
The poet...something he said...
I guess it's a combination you don't often see. Apparent attraction..
...and sort of...disinterest.
As if your mind's not all there.
Can I help?
You don't believe me.
Then why are you smiling like that?
Why'd you ask him.
I'm sorry I got you into this.
Who are you? Who do you work for?
I knew it. I told him.
I can't. He didn't do anything. Thanks to you.
We've had thefts of our new stuff ...GRUNER deals in this... A big deal is going down now. I went to see if GRUNER had anything to sell. But he didn't make any moves...And when you arrived, he backed off.
Someone is selling. You followed us. If it's not him, it must be you. If it's not you, it must be him... You scared him off.
What'd he say, how's he know about Al?
Let me tell you something, Lowell. Look, look, look. You're talking about two agents in a regional office in Louisville. I got the goddamn Unabomber threatening to blow up LAX! I gotta move 45 agents from all over the country into L.A.  Alright? When I get a chance, I'll give it a look...
When's the air date?
Yeah, I heard rumors.
A gun? Yes.
What caliber is my gun?
What does that mean? "Rife with -- ?"
No, only that we would hold the story until it was safe for him...
His "veracity" was good enough for the State of Mississippi.
I'm sorry, darling, have you seen my coffee mug...?
Will independent sources corroborate that?
Yes, I'm right here. Could you call me back on a hard line?
Area code 212-555-0199.
Okay, let's look through the looking glass the other way...
We got a guy... who wants to talk but he's constrained.  What if he were "compelled"?
Did I get you up?
How do you like your coffee? Black?
And, I'm unemployed. So I have to protect my medical coverage.  ...so I left them a message this morning. Their expanded confidentiality agreement? I will sign it.
The internet said you did graduate work in Wisconsin, then went to UC La Jolla with Professor... Marcus?
Next to your father?
Is that why you became a journalist? Then you get to ask all the questions?
My father was a mechanical engineer... most ingenious man I ever knew.
Why?
I drink. A couple of occasions more than I should have.  I was cited for shoplifting once. But it was a mistake...  I pushed Liane one time. We were both stressed out because of the pressure. She went to her mother's.  I got fired because when I get angry I have difficulty censoring myself. And I don't like to be pushed around!
I'm just a commodity to you, aren't I? I could be anything. Right? Anything worth putting on between commercials...
"Part of the reason I'm here is I felt that their representation clearly, at least within..."
Where are you, anyway?
You try and have a good time.
I heard you. But I got to arrange a legal defense first. I got to get you to testify in court, get it on public record.
Jail?
As you are well aware, my previous marriage ended with an unjustified strain on my reputation My motives were questioned. I was slandered in court.
Therefore in an effort to remove any trace of suspicion from my sweet Howard -- I wish to execute a pre- nuptial agreement.
They say the Massey pre-nup has never been penetrated.
Excuse me, Mr. Doyle, if I could just borrow your charming fiancee for a moment.
I'd just like to have a word with her.
Who's next, Mrs. Rabinow.
She's rich. We're still married. We have no pre-nup.
Is Tong older than Ming?
I'll have the tournedos of beef. And the lady will have the same?  I assume you're a carnivore.
I'd like to offer my congratulations. That was a beautiful gesture of Howard's.
Yes. He's a diamond in the rough. And I have a feeling that someday soon you'll be taking that diamond and leaving the rough.
I am thrilled for you, but tell me this... How'd you get Howard to do it? I've addressed enough juries to appreciate the power of suggestion, but it seemed like he thought it was his own idea.
Well, when this goes south -- promise you'll have dinner with me?
Friends?
Hi.
I have a surprise for you.
Wait! He works for YOU?
You were going to have this thug...?
Have you been taking your digestive enzymes?
Maybe.
But Marylin, without this, you're completely exposed.
What?!
Time marches on. Ardor cools.
Ah.
Gotcha. No need to get anatomically correct with me, Rex.
Well, with the expanding global population -- Let me ask you this -- your wife. Has she pursued the opportunities which must present themselves to the "knock-out, sexy woman" you described?
Not in court you can't. Has she retained counsel?
And your wife is aware of or has evidence of your activities?
Wrigley?
Kenneth this is my associate, Wrigley. Wrigley this is my friend, Dr. Beck.
Divorce was her childhood aspiration?
Mr. Warne?
Your whole life is devoted to just one thing. To accumulate more money. At least there's romance in what he's doing.
On a hunger strike, huh?  When'd she eat last?
Been sending her meals in regularly?
Why didn't you jam it down her throat?
Don't want to talk todon't want to talk to anybody. Don't want to see anybody.
Ooooooh.  Hello my would-be ex-son-in-law. I've sent you a check for a hundred thousand. Yes. That's the smartest thing you ever did, Westley, not to contest that annulment. That's satisfactory, isn't it? Yeah. Well, it ought to be. Oh I'm not complaining. It was dirt cheap.  Don't fall out of any windows.
Driver!
These seats accommodate two passengers, don't they?
You'll never get away with it, Miss Andrews. 
Just a spoiled brat of a rich man. You and Westley'll make an ideal team.
You'll never get away with it, Miss Andrews. Your father'll stop you before you get half way to New York.
That, I suppose, makes everythinguhquite all right.
Well, I hope you're not going to dictate whom I can talk to.
Thank you.  My, my! Scrambled eggs.
Nope. No complaints.
Why, you don't have to apologize, Mr. Warne. You'll never know how much I appreciate all this.
Must be the Spring.
He apologized for last night.  Said he didn't know we were married.
Thanks.  You think this whole business is silly, don't you? I mean running away and everything.
Yes, you do. You think I'm a fool and a spoiled brat. Perhaps I am, although I don't see how I can be. People who are spoiled are accustomed to having their own way. I never have. On the contrary, I've always been told what to do and how to do it and where and with whom. Would you believe it? This is the first time I've ever been alone with a man!
It's a wonder I'm not panic stricken.
Thanks. Nurses, governesses, chaperones, even body-guards. Oh, it's been a lot of fun.
It has its moments. It got to be a sort of game to try to outwit father's detectives. II did it once; actually went shopping without a body-guard. It was swell. I felt absolutely immoral. But it didn't last long. They caught up with me in a department store. I was so mad I ran out the back way and jumped into the first car I saw. Guess who was in it?
KingKing Westley was in it.
Um-hm. We rode around all afternoon. Father was frantic. By 6 o'clock he was having all the rivers dragged. 
Aw, now, don't you start telling me I shouldn't dunk.
Thanks, professor.
This looks like the best spot.
There it is. Better swallow it. We're not going to have any breakfast.
Carrots.
Uh-huh. Want one?
You don't think I'm going around panhandling for you.  Best thing in the world for youcarrots. Had a tough time getting them. If that farmer ever caught megoodnight!
You don't have to eat the carrots.  Just passed a pond with some ducks in it.
Maybe I could jump out of the window.  Do you think they'd see me?
Here's your ticket, ma'am.
Oh, thank you. Thank you.
In about fifteen minutes.
Heyyou not up yet? Come oncome on!
Joe, listen
Okay, Joe. Listenyou know I've always liked you. Anytime I could do you a great turnanytime I ran into a story that looked goodI always came running to you, didn't I? Well, I got one now. Those wires I sent you were on the level. It's the biggest scoop of the year. I'm giving it to you, Joe.
I told you! I told you, you couldn't trust him! He's gone!
Where do you live?
Got a couple of kids, huh?
You love them, don't you?
You'll keep your trap shut, all right.
If you don'tEver hear of Bugs Dooley?
Yeah, she was pretty, all right, but not half as cute as you, Deano.  You shoulda tried a legitimate line of business.
When did you first do business with this Bertrand?
Street cats?
Or a cover up!  Jesus, Bill, don't you have enough proof of the FBI's complicity now?
Did he pay you for this?
I still have to question what the legal basis is that supports this, boss.  Susie's stuff is colorful, but...
What's it look like, Nick?
Do you mind if I smoke, Mr. Garrison?
That's not true.  I never met anybody named Oswald.  Anybody who told you that has to be crazy.
No... if he did, I don't remember him.  There were lots of kids in and out... y'know.
No, I never saw him before in my life.
Yeah, now that's true.  I drove to Houston.
I hadn't been there ice skating in many years, and I had a couple of young friends with me, and we decided we wanted to go ice skating.
Oh, it was just a spur of the moment thing...  the storm wasn't that bad.
We went straight to Houston, and then Saturday night we drove to Galveston and stayed over there.
No particular reason.  Just to go somewhere.
In the morning we went goose hunting. Then headed home, but I dropped the boys off to see some relatives and I stayed in Hammond.
I believe the boys got a couple.
Oh yes, well, come to think of it, they're right.  We got to where the geese were and there were thousands of them.  But you couldn't approach them.  They were a wise bunch of birds.
Yes, now I remember, Mr. Garrison. I'm sorry, I got confused.  We got out there near the geese and it was only then we realized we'd forgotten our shotguns.  Stupid, right?  So of course we didn't get any geese.
Why?  What's wrong?
I don't remember his name.  You must understand it was quite crowded, and when you are called in circumstances like that to look at the wound of the President who is dead, you don't look around too much to ask people for their names and who they are.
No.
No, because there were others.  There were admirals.
If we go to him our investigation'll hit the front pages by sunrise. Blow up right in our face.  Ruby was just given a new trial.  If he has something to say, it'll be there. Susie, what did you find out on Oswald?
Aren't you being a little hard?
In the sheriff's report, Mrs. Mercer, it says you were at Dealey Plaza two hours before the assassination but that...
Hi.
My sympathies.
We waited for you... hours, Jim. You could have telephoned, for God's sake.  It's Easter!  You promised, Jim.
I think you care more about John Kennedy than your family!  All day long the kids are asking, "Where's Daddy?"  What am I supposed to tell your kids, Jim!
That sounds dandy, but it doesn't replace a father and a husband on Easter Day.
I want to thank you, Mr. O'Keefe, for this time.
Post Office.
I took it once for a low thyroid condition...  It raises the metabolism, Lou.  Did David Ferrie strike you as the kind of person who had a low metabolism?
Hell, you're the District Attorney. You read the Warren Report - and then you tell me you're satisfied Lee Oswald shot the President all by his lonesome.
Here's my problem, Jack.  You told me you and Guy were good friends for a long time?
And he never hit you before?
HOLD IT, CHIEF...
I know about that shot.  A terrible tragedy.  How much do you have for carrying on your investigation?
How many men are working with you on this?
That's all you've had all this time?
I'm sorry, I just decided to stay in the suit -- get out of that damn uniform.
Answer the question, nigga. Do you think I wanted to spend the thousand dollars on your ass? Yes or no?
Hi, I'm Detective Mark Dargus. L.A.P.D. can I ask what you have in that bag?
Oh, I wouldn't be so sure. What with all the cash, I think I could go with Conspiracy to Traffic.
Who put up my bond? Ordell?
What'dya think?
I called in sick this morning. As far as the airline knows, I'm still available.
I don't know yet. I'm going to talk with Dargus and Nicolet today. Do what you suggested. Offer to help and see what happens.
I want to talk to them first. I know more now about Ordell's money.
It's a lot of money. About a half-a- million dollars. All of it in Cabo in safe deposit boxes and more comin' in.
He told me last night.
He came by.
What're you, a bag lady?
You talk them into it?
Bring the money in and they follow it?
You don't actually do it that way?
Make the delivery somewhere in the mall.
I told them Ordell's changed the amount he's bringing in.
Oh, yeah. I got them thinking Ordell's real nervous. They love thinking he's scared of them.
That's Ordell's.
Oh, Miss Brown?
Ordell has a white guy working for him named Louis.
This afternoon before I came here. He was with Ordell at an apartment in Hermosa Beach. I don't know if he lives there, but I can find out.
Not really.
What for?
I imagine shit needs to be done.
Sure.
I got some vodka in the freezer.
Now, baby, that's got nothin' to do with you. I just carry that. You been listenin' to them cops too much.
Damn, Jackie, I was just playin' with you.
Baby, I ain't come here -- She shoves both guns in Ordell's back.
I understand woman, damn!
You told em? You told em it's me?
Well, shit. That don't mean you gotta confirm it!
Didja tell 'em anything else?
And a hundred thousand if I go to jail.
You're fourteen years old here?
I thought you were sixteen.
Were you a disco girl?
So where did you go?
We're leaving now!
See, what did I tell you? Man in New York wants a 9 millimeter Smith and Wesson Model 5946. Why does he want it? It's the gun that nigga on "New York Undercover" uses. Because of that nigga, I can sell it to this nigga for twelve-fifty.
As low as two.
If this is about you fucked Melanie, I don't give a damn. I ain't a fool. I leave you alone with a bitch like Melanie, you're gonna be fuckin' that twenty minutes after I'm out the door. So say "thank you" and I'll tell you, "you're welcome."
Okay, so it was Jackie Brown.
'fore I blow that bitch's brains out, I'll ask her.
If there were nothin; in here but towels, maybe she didn't get a chance to take it from her suitcase and A.T.F. got it. But, she put these fuckin' books in here to trick our ass.
Then she throws forty thousand in here, to rub the shit in my face, know what I'm saying? She wants me to know she ripped me off.
Who's it for? A relative?
Ten thousand sounds high.
What's up with this shit.
My money's in that office, right?
She starts givin' me some bullshit about it ain't there. It's somewhere else and we can go get it.  I'm shootin' you in the head right then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot her in the kneecap, find out where my godamn money is. I go walkin' in there and that nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you're the first man shot, understand what I'm sayin'?
Now, is there anything you want to tell me before we get out of this car?
You sure?
Get me out of here.
Take me home.
Dead? No. I just hurt my back. I'm not dead.
I'm alive.
I don't know. I don't know.  This isn't happening.
Let me out of here!
Daddy!
You're hurting me!
Daddy. Let go.
Who's been talking to you? The army? Have they been talking to you, huh?
Dr. Carlson's dead?
Are you in the service?
Ah. Neither snow nor sleet, nor dark of night ... I always admired that.
What a dream I was having. I was living with another woman ... You know who it was?
Jezebel, from the post office. You remember, you met her that time at the Christmas party. I was living with her. God, it was a nightmare. There were all these demons and I was on fire. Only I was burning from ice.
She was good in bed, though.
She had these real beefy thighs. Delicious.
You up?
Where'd you leave 'em?
Did you look around the headboard?
It's still there, Jake.  Even if you never say a word about it. You can't spend two years in Vietnam ...
New York is filled with creatures. Everywhere. And lots of stations are closed.
Demons, Jake? Come on. They're winos and bag ladies. Low life. That's all they are. The streets are crawling with 'em. Don't make em into somethin' they're not.  It's the pressure, honey. That's all it is.
Kids on a joy ride. Happens all the time.
Don't gimme that.
Jezzie! My feet are throbbing!
Don't!
I'm not here. You haven't seen me.
So tell me ... am I still an angel?
Anyway, this big offensive was coming up. Everyone knew it; Time Magazine, Huntley-Brinkley. And the brass was scared 'cause they knew we couldn't win. Morale was down. It was gettin' ugly in the States. Hell, you remember.
Excuse me, do you know if we've passed Nostrand Avenue yet?  Excuse me.  Look, I'm asking a simple question. Have we hit Nostrand Avenue? I fell asleep.
I'll page him.
We're doing everything we can.
I'm afraid to go by myself anymore. I keep thinkin' one of 'em's gonna come up behind me. Somethin's wrong when a guy can't even take a leak by himself. I've seen 'em take people right off the street. I used to go home a different way every night. Now I can't even go home.
What about your girlfriend? You don't think she'll mind?
Okay, enough of this shit.
We can't lead him into the other hull!
Can't shut em' down from here.
Everyone okay?
Brodski! Get to Lab two. We have an emergency!
Boeman, the ships not here.
Yeah, I got ya. I don't see anything inside though.
You sumbitch! Three dead! On my watch! If that...that thing is out there, it's dead! You got it!!!
Don't just stand there! Shoot him!
Jason seemed to have the right stuff. Physically, anyway. Radiation, cell damage, didn't matter. He just kept going.
Delongpre, you don't even know me.
We must assume the machete was an intricate part of the game of hockey.
Thinking with your dick again, Delongpre?
He's trying to ask you out on a date.
Hey teach! This rock's starting to freeze! Get your ass back hre!
You're quicker than usual.
Robot huh?
Barbie from hell...
Yeah 3cpo, I saw STAR WARS, now how about you help me get out of this coffin, Barbie...
Sorry, sorry.
I don't understand...what does he want?
How did I get here, how did you bring me back?
Nano...but nanotechnology is impossible.
How do you open the damn door?
Son! -- Out of the water now!
What's the point with hooks and Lines? --
What about us?
Sexy, hm? What was I before?
Home... New York?
Who's that young man?
I didn't say this wasn't the shark, I just said I wasn't sure this was the one...
Don't they have lifejackets or something? An extra boat?
Don't shoot him any more! He's crazy on his own blood already!
Look, I've got to talk to her. This isn't a contest we want the whole country entering.
Here's to your husband, the only other rational man on the island. Day after tomorrow, I'll be gone, and he'll be the only one.
Going out on the 'Aurora.'
Is it! The best-funded research expedition to ever study the shark... around the world in 18 months.
Better than Cousteau, or Compagno with computers, telemetry, Defense Department funding...
Yep.
Nothing. Nothing, nothing, nothing.
Face and head scars come from amateur amusements in the bar room. This love line here...  ...that's from some crazy Frenchie come after me with a knife. I caught him with a good right hand right in the snot locker and laid him amongst the sweetpeas.
That's disgusting! This is the largest, meanest, most vicious shark ever landed off Amity Island, and a known maneater!
Well! Nothing like experimenting.
Are you honestly and truly going to prom with Katrina De Voort?
Leah just told me you were going with her.
Wait, what's that supposed to mean?
That was a mistake, Juno. Mark is a married stranger. You overstepped a boundary.
It doesn't work that way, kiddo. You don't know squat about the dynamics of marriage.
So, let's discuss how we're gonna do this... thing.
Why aren't you at work?
No shit. Like Johannes Brahms?
Like what?
Oh.
Titanium Power! Get more snatch by the batch!
You're kind of a sellout, aren't you? What would the Melvins say?
Vanessa. Shit, you better get out of here.
Nothing. She just hates when I sit around watching movies and 'not contributing.'
"Most Fruitful Yuki"? What is... Oh my god, she's a pregnant superhero!
Hi! I'm Vanessa. You must be Juno and Mr. MacGuff. I'm Vanessa.
What...
Mark? Why is Juno crying?
Did you say you were thinking about adoption?
Well, you know where the lavatory is.  You pay for that pee stick when you're done! Don't think it's yours just because you've marked it with your urine!
Look at this one "Wholesome, spiritually wealthy couple have found true love with each other."  "All that's missing is your bastard."
You're not listening to me.
What did you have in mind, a family of disturbed loners who are into gunplay and incest?
All right, how about this one? "Healthy, educated couple seeking infant to join our family of five. You will be compensated. Help us complete the circle of love."
I want a huge cookie. And like, a lamb kebob. Simultaneously.
You guys are playing music?
No.
You dropped this.
You shouldn't let him do that to you...
Adele... are you serious?
What if they're dangerous?
Nobody wants to hurt you Peaches!
Can't hurt.
Hey... Ain't we getting near the next murder site... Bri?
Hey. I didn't have the heart to wake you.
Feel sorry for him? Obviously you didn't get a whiff of that sock?
Up yours.
Brian I want him out of our car!
Ain't you done enough drinking for tonight?
You're supposed to call me when you lose your job Early. I stopped by the mirror factory today, you left quite a mess behind there.
Shit.
You wanna go to Paul's house?
I'm sure he's got food. He's always got those microwave burrito things in his freezer.
I don't know, he quit dealin' but I'll bet he'll smoke us out.
Probably.
78th.
I'm not joking. I wanted to take my dick out and start jacking right there. At that point and moment, Darcy was like a vision of perfection.
At that moment, at that block party, she represented everything holy about a virgin.
I'm gonna fuck her tonight. I swear to God I'm gonna fuck her.
I don't care motha fucka. I'll bet you money she fucks me.
Yo. I'm gonna get buff dude.
Sup then? Sup?
Do you like kissing me?
You know what I want to do?
What do I want to do?
Why?
Because your a virgin?
You think I want a baby? When you're with me, you don't have to worry about that kinda stuff.
Because I like you. I think you're beautiful. I think if we fucked you would love it. You wouldn't even believe it.
I don't know. I just think that you would love it.
Sorry.
Yep, yep. But he has to know what he's doing and where he's going. Because they can like touch you for hours and they won't ever know.
I'll ask you one last time. Do you have diss digg?
I've known the past of all the people I've fucked without a condom. Like I know one of the people got tested and was negative.
And I know that one of them fucked like two other girls, who were both virgins, so I knew he was safe.
What are you guys doing?
You want a wip-it?
I've talked to a few people who say you and her were... friendly?
We didn't ask for your opinion, Doctor.
You set yourself up tonight when you attacked Kathy, you crazy fuck!
The F.B.I. has nothing remotely similar to this guy.  I think he's a first- timer.
A few people.
What do you mean, stand out?
Now that you mention it there was somebody who looked suspicious.
I suppose you want to know where I'm going to kill tonight, Peter?
Interesting concept.  I hadn't thought of that.  If you think about how Anton Berger plays chess you might get it.
What's this?
It worked out alright, didn't it?
Congratulations, dad.
He tapes their mouths shut.  We found traces of adhesive around the victims mouths.  We're doing a chemical analysis for components, but it's probably a standard brand you can buy in any hardware store.
I don't think it matters.  Last nights victim, Christie Eastman was found in a warehouse on the outskirts of town. The night before, Debi Rutlege was found in the center.
We can't rely on your judgement anymore.
You want me to go with you?  Maybe I can help.
A shadow.  What's as big a castle?  As light as air , but one hundred men can't move it?  The shadow of the castle.  Are there any buildings that have the name Castle in it that cast a shadow long enough to fall across another building?
You have something you want to say?
About what?
Well, I think I've had enough.
Relax.
I know it was bad.
Fine.
You.
This letter.  I've never opened it.
Because I know what it says.
Take off your clothes. I'm going to scrub you down.
We're almost married.
Take the western passage.
With two or three days' practice, you'll be able to use it as well as I can. Then we'll have a chance of fighting our way out of here.
There is no other way.
No. We will find another way to locate the Fortress.
Yes.
Lyssa? <u>Why</u>?
Can she be forced?
Never.
Then we must reach her before she feels that pain.
How did you know?
Help! Help! I'm drowning!
It could have been quicksand! I might have been sucked to my death.  Where is this place?
Blast! A thousand miles off course. Well, I was rushed. There was a certain difference of opinion concerning a venison pie. The foolish man left it sitting on his windowsill. What did he expect?
They burn many villages. Even walled cities fall to them.
A good thrust, my friend. Another second and there'd have been nothing between my head and shoulders but bad memories.
I am Ergo the Magnificent ...  ... short in stature ...  ... tall in power ...  ... narrow of purpose ...  ... wide of vision.
Oh, my poor stew!
It's a lie!
He will not!
We seek the Fortress of Krull.
The new King.
You know the voice.
It is the time.
We must reach the Valley of Reeds before the next dawn.
It will not help.
No, no.
Yeah... Well... I don't know.. I don't know any.
The yellow and pink.
...You can leave whenever you want. I don't refrain you.
It's cool departing this way... warm... music...
...I'd like knowing what he's listening to...
...Don't you drink?
You say it just to calm me!
...Who sent you?
This smells good.
Here comes the resume.
I have to finish first.
So what's the deal Maurice?
I mean why the sudden voluntary visit  -- usually it takes gun- point to get you in here...
Yes -- you are.
I want to be shown...  Maurice would you do anything for me?
Anything?
It isn't going to make it Ellen. Let the poor thing go quietly.
You don't have to prove anything to her.
Your parents would want you to be in bed.
Lizy, Eliza... Elizabeth Bennett...  Pride and Prejudice.
It has to be a full character's name.
They printed your article on, 'Dry Verses Can Dog Food'... Very enlightening.
Ellen told me that she didn't know if I loved her.
We do the operation after I finish. I can't risk not finishing... I thought you understood what I was doing.
Why in God's name did you fly all the way here then?
I don't have kids.
Hello!
Are you working?
What's the story? Are you too drunk to come?
You OK?
Thank you. What time is it?
Hi!
I like women who wear mismatched earrings.
What do you mean?
Years ago, in LA, I turned a trick on Sunset and Western. The guy was polite and didn't argue about the price. He parked his car and I took him to a house that I had an arrangement with. A fat Mexican woman was watching a TV and I told him to give her the twenty for the room. There were three or four small naked children playing on the floor and we had to step over them to get into the room. The room had a bed and a dresser. He lay on his back on the bed and I put a rubber on him and sucked him for a while until he was hard and then I eased on to him. About twenty minutes later there was a knock on the door and it was the woman saying our time was up. I felt kind of guilty because he hadn't come and I offered to reason with the woman and get another ten minutes, but he said it was all right and began dressing. When we were ready to leave the room he stopped me and... hugged me and kissed me on the cheek. He gave me an extra hundred as a tip and went back to his car. I remember being relieved that I wouldn't have to work again that evening.
Where was that house? The one in LA, I mean.
So... are you alone, or are you just using me to make someone else jealous?
Where are you staying?
Well... I thought you might be looking for a date.
Yes? What?
Is he always such an ass?
But is he an ass that's gonna win my case?
He thinks I'm guilty, doesn't he?
Okay -- Ms. Windham, when you uh arrived back at the house? Was your father there?
And when you came downstairs, what happened?
But Mrs. Windham didn't have a gun?
All I know is -- it's not Brooke.
I do. I'm not allowing it.
-- his life?
So, this is the only interaction you two have ever had?
Have you ever considered asking him if he'd like a cold beverage? Or perhaps a neck massage?
Warner can't even do his own laundry.
Did you know he got wait-listed when he applied? His father had to make a call.
We still love you. Sisters forever!
Do they just -- put you on the spot like that? Like, all the time?
Damn. We can't see her for an hour?
Back up. How do you know he's gay?
How could this happen?
It's pink.
C'mon. Let me take you home.
If you tell him, you'll probably make summer associate. Who cares about Brooke? Think about yourself.
Elle?
Fight's over before it's begun... soon the survivors will be in full retreat.
Damn you!
What you do, boy?  You be velly solly, come here intellupt my sleep.
What?  Speakee loud!  No hear velly good.
You come stealee tleasoo?
No need lie, boy.  I no hurt you. Do I look like I wanna hurt you?
Course not.  I no flum here.  I come flum Cathay.
Country fa' fa' away.  To the East, beyond the lising sun...
You got no idee.  People there lookee diffelent; speakee diffelent. Nothing the same.  In my countlee I bling good luck.  Makee lain and thunder.
Dlagon not like that.  Dlagon is spilit of life... spilit of stlength and goodness.
Flozen foleva not good.
An' how you do it?  How you rift cuss?
You come stealee tleasoo?
Why, Jack-lad, she likes you, is all.  And what hot-blooded hero wouldn't welcome the affections of a fair nymph like Oona here...?  If your blood runs so cold, boy, you be a corpse before your time.
Better pray the worm's a sound sleeper, Jack.
There's the spirit, lad.  If ye run into trouble, give a yank here and we'll haul ye up.
We must follow that bird.
Jenny Greenteeth said:  "Follow the raven in her flight..."
I'm sure.  It spoke to me.
Beware.
My God!  Look!
Archers!  Bring down that spider! I'll deal with this other creature...
That be so, better you pinch yourself now, Jack.
The kitchen be the most important room in a palace, for if the victuals ain't right, little else is likely to be so.
Nay, lad, we're here to collect a weapon you'll need fighting the Baron.
Sunlight.
You must find the ring... It completes the cycle; answers the riddle...
Someone like Floki... or Squarefoot... or --
Oh, dear.
I've lost my napkin.  It was all elf-work and lace... I must have dropped it when you startled me so.
Don't leave me now.  I fear the unicorn won't show himself without you.
The napkin will keep.  I'd rather not be alone.
I thought you were dead... I --
Think me fair, do you, Jack?
The moon is too round of face, methinks.
I like well your conceit, Jack.  Tis rare to find an honest lad in this troubled world.
Dear lad, what does winter bespeak but death?  It is a time of mourning.  This calamity is a curse. Something wondrous and beautiful has been taken from the world.
What care I for the human heart! Such a soft, spiritless thing it is. I prefer the hearts of hawks and wolves; fierce and free and keen as steel!
I would build a wall around me with such stone, so the likes of you might never enter.
What care the bones when the soul is free?
No hurt Jimmy, sir... oh no, please, sir...
Dad's disappeared!
What's that for?
Oh.
I'd be more comfortable if he slept in the guestroom.
You have to ask like that?
Josh and I are going to South Coast. Wanna ride?  Maybe see a movie?
Hey, I can get you three hundred cash for two hours.
I wouldn't want you as a friend.
I'm good, thanks.
Pardon me?
Oh...nothing.  Thirty pounds.  I just haven't been very hungry.
Is Alyssa home?
Oh...do you know when she'll be home?
I never said anything.  I haven't done anything.
Do you ever get like the slightest inkling that you might want to help me instead of doing absolutely nothing?
I've been using since I was twelve! You're all so unbelievably stupid.  You didn't give a shit about anything I did until now!
You're too fucking late.
You can't make me do a thing.
I wish you had told me then.
I gave up on you.
What would you be doing now?
If I asked you to stop, would you?
I'm proud of you, Sam.
I don't wanna go, Sam.
Ah!  Oh....
What are you doing?
George --
With your hands or your tongue?
I know they're not much help, but they love coming here, George.
Don't move!
I don't have a clue anymore.  I wish you'd talk to him.  He needs a man.
I was talking about our marriage.
Hey.
You got a dog?
All day again?
Don't take it so hard, Biscuit. She don't mean nothin' to him.
I apologize, Claude. That was rude of me.
You been on the farm for quite a spell, haven't you?
For the kind of money they charge here, you'd think they could hire somebody to actually wash the dishes.
Here, this belongs to you.  It was empty when I found it.
Thanks for backing me up here, Uncle Claude.
You're soft.
Life?! How long is life? We were just walking back to the truck. We didn't do nothing! Fuck life!
Maynard Banks, Esquire. Attorney at law.
We'll just get off at the next stop.
That's right, we'll get off at the next stop. The train's pulling into the station right now.
Let it go, Claude.
Wilkins' driver's got the flu, so he asked me to fill in for him.
Are you trying to tell me after all this time you finally have a plan for busting out of here?
Don't tell me, I don't want to hear it. It's probably all fucked up, anyway.
It's too late for plans.
At least he didn't kill Santa Claus with his bare hands.
We don't need no fences at Camp 8, boss.
That musta messed 'em up pretty bad.
I can't take that, mama.
Besides, why bother with bootlegging when we got us a clear cut case of murder?
Who?
Man, that music is hot. What goes on down there, Slim?
Blacks welcome there?
Of course I can. Drink or she dies.  Unlike you, she won't come back from where she's going.
Hello, Cassius.
You know, New Hell really only needs one new Satan.
I remember that night, you had like four daiquiris.
How did you see me?
They castrated him. He can't shoot arrows, he can't piss smoke.
All that running and chasing is making the sleep thing want to come early.
No, no, that's not what I said. He can keep his thumbs, but the fingers gotta go.
This is bad, Nicky.
Hey.
Thanks.
You got it. Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
I was in love one time but she said I wasn't financially reliable enough. And she needed that.
You sure you're down with this?
I'm not Nicky. I'm not home! I don't live here!
I'd love to have a dog. But I go to school full time. It wouldn't be fair to the dog.
Parsons School of Design. I knew growing up I wasn't much to look at, so I put my energy into making things that are pretty.
Can we go fly over Central Park?
It looks like the work of a brother...
We're hungry do you have anything to eat?
I designed it myself.  What'll it be... a face job or a full-body job?
You missed something special.
It's him! The first Sandman. He killed... Doc.
He's the one. You too. I remember. He was in a hurry. Just a face job. Dark hair, I said. Then he killed Doc and you grabbed me -- and the machine blew up and I ran... I ran.
You can have any woman in the city. What do you really want?
I don't believe you. There has to be more.
I'm ashamed. I was bringing you to be killed.
Logan, I don't know where Sanctuary is. But if I take you to them, they'll kill you.
Yes, but they won't know that... or care. They're hunting you, Logan. Maybe me too, now...
I -- I can't.
Don't!
Look at his face... and his hair...  Is that what it is to grow old?
What kind of jewel is this?
You're both full of secrets like Macavity.  Did you steal this?
How did you get here?
Are there any other humans?
Is that really it? It doesn't seem very far. Will we be there soon?
This rod is a fuckin', embarrassment, Carl. Whatiya burn in this thing, "V"?
Listen.
Why not?
Now we'll see what this son of a bitch is up to.
He'll kill us.
I'm not positive... but... he knows.
I don't know.
Alice...
You don't look so good.
The police called us.
They wanted to know if we'd had a chance to find out what happened to you the other night. They wanted to know if you remembered anything.
Repeat that, Bill.
Of course, it's Madison!!! Who else could it be?
Where is he now?
Did you ask him who he is?
If he's not Madison, then where's Madison?
Do you remember?
That's it.
It's nice to know I can still make you laugh.
That's why I married you.
We will.
Did you see that about the guy who chopped up his wife into a million pieces?
They're gonna cook him.
How ya doin', Pete?
What's happening to you? What happened to your face?
What do you mean?... You've been acting strange lately... Like the other night.
Last time I saw you.
You sure weren't acting like the Pete Dayton I've always known.
Cable from Gainsford.
Sorry.
Uh-huh.
Wait a minute, you expect to be knighted for finding that soupbone?
Yeah, I remember. You said that before.
Something tells me this means food. Come on!
Yeah. You know.
Hey, hurry up, you slow-pokes - I'm starved!
Hey - look!
But Mr. Chang, all these things - books, instruments, sculpture - do you mean to say they were all brought in over those mountains by porters?
Well, it must have taken
Centuries! Where did you get the money to pay for all those treasures?
You know, it's very, very strange, but when you saw me in the corridor, I was actually on my way to you. I bring the most amazing news.  The High Lama wishes to see you, Mr. Conway.
No, I can't! I can't! You've got to let me rest! You've got to let me rest!
All right, go ahead!  We go on to the next plane. Bring out any people that are left.
Oh George, come on.
What about the porters?
Didn't you find out anything about the porters?
So everyone is serenely happy in Shangri-La? Nobody would ever think of leaving?  It's all just so much rot! She's pleaded with me ever since I came here to take her away from this awful place. She's cried in my arms for hours, for fear I'd leave her behind. And what's more, she's made two trips to the plateau to bribe the porters - for me!
I guess we're in for it.
I don't know. He must have had some purpose in taking the plane away from Fenner.  When he lands, we'll find out.
What do you suggest?
I'm thirty.
Why, he's speaking English.
So... this door.  It's... not an exit...  ?
From now on, you'll respond only to the name "Jay." You'll dress in appropriate attire specially sanctioned by the INS Special Services. You're not to stand out in any way.  Understand?
Kay, listen, I dunno what got into--
Well, how about if I guess, then? Black: Vast space.  Deep. Spiritual. The essence of infinity.
what's this?
Jesus Christ...
We saw it in the office.  It went from this big...    to big...   in a day.
Yeah.  His dream and our worst nightmare.
When?
Pardon me.  I hate to break up this lovely little group hug, but we people aren't ready for what we have.  How is this going to help?
Why don't you ask the Mosebacke?     Brazil. Until 44 years ago they ate with their hands, lived in huts, and didn't even know the rest of the world existed. 44 years ago a well intentioned missionary gave them a fork.  Today, they don't exist.
Found it.
How's Dee?
Yeah?  What's up?
Drop some money.
Can't you see?  She just wanted her little girl back.
The drowning woman.  Anne... But it was too late.  Her little girl was already gone.
She grew up.
You don't remember me, do you?
That's an old one.  One of our first.
That's right.  It's a combined data stream based on all three previsions.
And this is exactly the kind of behavior that will give them an excuse to do it.
John --
Got him in the Foxhall.  4421 Gainsborough.
Uh, yeah, you mind getting me a piece of that cake they're eating down there?  I'm starving.
At least now you -- and I -- have the chance to make sure that kind of thing doesn't happen to anyone ever again.
Flaws.
Are these all of her previsions?
I scored a goal!
Where've you got him?  Is he all right?  Tell me, you fuck -- WHERE IS HE?!
You have three minutes to tell me what you're doing here before I feed you to a few of my more predacious plants.
John?
Oh, God, what did you do?
Then how did he --
Sir, the press conference is starting.
Now the second image.  Watch the water.  The wind's changed.  The ripples are going the other way.
Crime of passion.  No premeditation.  They show up late. Most of our scrambles are flash events like this one.  We rarely see anything with premeditation anymore.
There a maid in this hotel?
If you were a child killer, you took these pictures, would you leave them out on the bed for anyone to find?
What kind of cop were you before this?
Howard --
They've never been separated before.
What do you think?  So he can kill whoever he wants to without anyone knowing about it.
I don't know about you guys, but I'm starting to feel a really sexual vibe here.
It's a poison arrow tree frog.
She needs a family. A dad. I'll give her what you never had.
He making the drop?
What's his name?
So, when's the drop.
Yeah. Sure.
I gotta tell you, Mr. Reuben, I'm not comfortable getting in any deeper. It's one thing to look after Jess...
It's not that I don't appreciate the offer...
What's the plan?
Aren't we waiting for Ricky?
Taken care of?
We look good this year.
I still can't believe you missed the fucking team bus.
Your first start at DB, it's against Fairfax, and you miss the fucking bus.
We're not delivering shit. Ruiz is delivering something, and whatever it is is his business.
Maxie says he runs a tight ship. I wouldn't fuck with him.
I gotta pick up the baby.
I like it.
Shit. No new pages. I don't even know where the fuck we're supposed to go.
So is this the drop?
He woulda told us right?
Put that shit out...
I swear to God, I'll fucking puke.
C'mon...
Yes?
It's in your copy of Hemispheres. I believe it's Mickey Blue Eyes.
I'll get you the list of videos, if you don't mind, I'll offer the other passengers a beverage.
How much is what?
I'm half Irish.
Yeah.
Can I borrow a piece of --
No...
I'm working trains. Selling.
Keeps me out of the army.
Not this boy... I ain't fighting their war. I got my own. Right chere. Heard tell you're a good man to know.
I told you less paper, less trouble.
And every cat's watching, ain't they? It's a toe-down.
Let Billie finish.
Leggo. I got to wash it out.
You pitch, baby; I'll ketch.
Now about our coming up in the world a little. You're not naive. You're a man of the world. The Movement's grown; we've grown with it. You know folks. They want their leaders to be prosperous. One hand washes the other.
Sure I'll speak to your class. But I'm a hard man on women. You want to know why?
It won't be easy.
It will be rough.
I'll be away a lot.
Malcolm, they keep calling, threatening us. I'm going crazy, when is this going to stop?
Dear heart, where are you?
I just put them to bed. Can we come to the meeting tomorrow?
Now just a moment, just a moment --
Just what are you saying?
She know?
How many you turning out?
Make it 1000. We got a lot of fishing to do.
Baby, I was gonna give it to you.
That ain't bad.
Who the hell are they?
My country needs justice. Proper justice. Gunning men down in the street only feeds the violence. They need to be brought to trial. Dealt with properly. Then people will respect the law. When they see it works.
You walk out and deal justice. You're what I wish I could be.  The policemen who kills you, his family will have all they want.
I want to arrest you for murder! I want to shake your hand and reload your gun! I want to kill my pride and give you my blessing.
No, but I have to admit I thought about it.
You have no interest in making things easy, do you?
Another favor... get me banking info on Jordan Kalfus. U.S. deposits or withdrawals. Thanks. Oh, get me the same on Samuel Ramos.
[She's late, Mr. Creasy.]
[No offense, but I'm sorry that your profession needs to exist.]
[Do you ever see the hand of God in what you do?]
[The bible says, "Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good."]
[The most important thing in life is family. And there you are. You have my family. What do you want?]
[This is not possible. But in that house I have money. If I tell you where --]
What is it?
Your Spanish is good enough. You certainly look the part.
Well, you'd have to keep it under control.
I'll take the .45 and the Webley .32.
Hmmm?
So you were unhappy?
Did you sleep alright?
How's the ankle? Can you put your weight on it?
I'm not afraid you, Creasy.
You've done much of this work before?
Creasy... Wait.
Good news. You're going back to school.
He has experience in related work. A great deal of it.
[Then what do you have to lose?]
I told you she wasn't especially attractive, but that she had a good deal of charm, and she's really a real nice girl...
I told you she wasn't attractive...
Millie's been after me to fix her up with a date, so I...
We gotta whole pot inna kitchen. We give you a plate-a your own.
I wake up this morning, I hear the baby crying. So I wake up. I come in their room. That girl is shaking her hand atta baby. I said, "You brute! Don't you strike that baby! That's my son's baby!"
That's my son Thomas's baby.
Did I tell you she threw the bottle- a milk at me?
She's a witch, that one. I tell you what happen yesterday?
...you teach chemistry? That's funny. Where? What school?
Siddown, take off your coat. You want something to eat? We gotta whole half-chicken in the icebox.
No, thank you, really, Mrs. Pilletti.
Couldn't she find some sort of hobby to fill out her time?
What I like about Mickey Spillane is he knows how to handle women. In one book, he picks up a tomato who gets hit with a car, and she throws a pass at him. And then he meets two beautiful twins, and they throw passes at him. And then he meets some beautiful society leader, and she throws a pass at him, and...
Hello, Ma.
Sure, Ma, it's okay with me.
Hello, Ma, waddaya say, it's getting a little late.
Waddaya mean, Ralph?
He says okay, it's all right Catherine comes here.
Listen, let's go downa Kaplans' apartment. They told us to come down.
There's sort of a built-in prayer for the sick man to get well, but of course that's not the basic intention.
Yes, O'Reilly?
Okay, I'm a witness, but how do you prove who's right?
So long, Ho-Jon.
Well, there it is. Jesus!
Must be Painlees Pole Day in the Shower Tent.
Where the hell we going to get us a football team?
Hell, man, that don't matter. We're loaded. We were big wheels in the black market in Seoul.
I was just asking...
A-negative. I've cross-matched it.
Or you can let him knock himself out. You personally'd be sending him to his grave.
Did I ever tell you about Me Lay Marston?
I can't feel it now either. The mother must have gone in.
It was in the cava and the hole sealed itself off. I must have jiggled it just enough to turn it loose. I can't feel it in the heart or the right pulmonary artery. So it's in the left pulmonary artery.
We'll have to close this hole and make one on the other side.
The bastards outconned us.
If you start the game instead of waiting, you mean?
He should come to now for a while, but he's got so much dope in him by tomorrow he won't know fact from fantasy.
What do you care? You'll be on your way to Japan.
It's your decision, Maria. I don't want to high-pressure you.
Why can't you look at him?
What's the story?
What's wrong with him?
Morning Painless. How they goin'?
We'll find out what they are when you throw us out.
What's wrong with you?
Those two big guys were tackles on the Cleveland Browns, and the redhead played halfback with the Rams.
We don't have to see him. Call that halfassed Army hospital and tell them to be ready to put some lipiodol in this kid's esophagus and take X- rays.
Here. Sit down!  Quiet, egghead!  All right, now, a serious expression.
Oh, come on, now. This is serious. You're a man disgusted with all of civilization.
Yes, you're sore at the world. Come on, now.
Well, would you like to know who it was you were marrying?
Oh, somebody else sitting there?
That's your father's diary, Ann.
There's enough in it for a hundred speeches, things people ought to hear nowadays. You be careful of it, won't you dear?  It's always helped keep your father alive for me.
You're supposed to be a smart guy! If it was raining hundred dollar bills, you'd be out looking for a dime you lost some place.
Well, okay. But we don't want more than a couple o' hundred people in on this thing. Now the first thing I want is an exact copy of the John Doe letter in your own handwriting.
Colonel!
Has he been here?
Have you seen him?
Where's Connell?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Ba-ll!
How could he be a fake? 
A what?
Join the John Doe Club.
Don't write 'em? Why, that gold- grabbin' dame would double-cross her own mother for a handful of Chinese yen!
How about family? Got any family?
Oh, just traveling through, huh?
Oh, yeah. That's what I mean. See? It was easy as all that, huh?
Hello, guys.
What happened? Is there a problem?
I... I'm Kevin. I 'm here to help you, D... Dave.
The Old Guy? What kind of show of faith is that? I want Debbie.
What do you got on Korda?
Did you check out DMV for any vehicles registration?
How about the record room for any incident reports? He might be a victim. We can get medical records. Check with burglary detail and see if anyone else knows him, knows his habits.
And what about bars? We can talk to neighbors to see what bars he frequents.
I'm impressed. I didn't think you could do it. What did you have to do, steal them?
That's not going to look too good on your service record.
Eighty-five percent of domestic disturbances of this nature end in murder/suicide.
I can't do that.
I bought you a four-six exacta box. You owe me twenty bucks.
See this. Solis has me driving the shit-mobile, and he picked this up straight out of impound for fourteen grand. Probably worth thirty.
Have you evacuated anyone?
Is the hostage injured?
Hey.
A little late for that, Scottie. He's asleep.  Jack Daniels?
Maybe you should be.
What about Greg? What are you gonna tell him?
When?
Stay here, don't move.
Tell him to give me a raise.
There are two million people in there with you.
They have nothing to do with this --
Do you believe in miracles?
Halden sent men to kill me in my sleep, but simple illusions won out.  So he now sends the legend to finish the deed.
Remember, I'm not the one who chose this.
He had keys.
Because why the hell would you be interested in a program that allows people to live inside your machines?  I mean how much profit could there possibly be from owning the universe and selling space in it to people who are dying, or people who are just God-Damned sick of this world --
We drugged her.  So she wouldn't remember.
There was no need to kill her.
Identical.  One's you.  One's digital.
Don't know what you're talking about.
Connect to public access.
Select uplink for Federal Communications Office.  Department of Enforcement.
So how can we get to it?
SYSTEM MALFUNCTION!
By bouncing ultra-high frequencies off one of the network satellites, I can send a long-range pulsar signal to within TWO FEET of the Rangers coordinates.
All systems go!
IMPACT IN FIFTEEN SECONDS!
And how do we do that?
No offense, boss, but they might find you a little disgusting.
Don't you ever have anything nice to say?!
NINJA APE ZORD!
We have a commission. If there's a dispute over territory, the commission decides.
The commission don't decide how I spend my honeymoon.
Boo-Boo.
Their asses are here, but their fuckin' heads are still in Sicily.
We'll start small. When we got 'em lined up, we increase the supply a bit at a time. Only sell the best stuff. And keep the price high, 'cause ya know how folks hate the taste of cheap booze.
Mad Dog Coll's in town on a job.
Inside, they were talking of you.
No. They envy you.
Would it be painful for you?
At least Masseria plays by the rules. Maranzano thinks he's God, and the rules don't apply.
Yeah. So who the fuck does?
This business is about taking risks.
When ya got all that blood workin' in your belly, it ain't upstairs where it needs to be.
Not stupid. Fat.
We combine everything. You are my second in command.
You get fifteen percent.
Your Calabrian friend, I will accept. At least Costello eats pasta like us.
And if I had known, I would have warned you to expect this. We could have prepared.
Thank you for keeping me informed.
You think this is a coincidence? Next week half your customers will be buying their Scotch, our Scotch, from Maranzano. In a month, he'll be in Scotland talking to my distillers, because you can't move product. I'll be out of business, and you'll be working for Maranzano.
Not by scurrying around like a puppies in a roomful of elephants.
So we're gonna knock 'em both off?
Now don't pick a fight. I'm staying over.
Yeah, I know - Picasso. <u>Guernica</u>, right? That's what everybody says - although personally, I don't see the resemblance. What are you drinking?
Olive or eyeball?
Dark Town. Land of nightmares. I'm Bull.
At the moment, yes.
Comas are unpredictable. He could wake up today, tomorrow, a month from now...
Holy shit.
Guys, I don't mean to be rude, but I only have eleven hours and fifty-three minutes to...
Priceless! Priceless! This stuff just <u>kills</u> me!
Oh yeah. There's just one thing I don't get. "Monkeybone Creator Awakens from Coma" that's a big story! That's front page news! But I can't find a <u>word</u> of coverage in this stinkin' rag! <i></i> Hey. Don't I have a TV show?
I'm fine, baby. We're all okay. We were lucky.
I'm so sorry, Stu. I <u>wanted</u> to tell you what was going on. I really, really liked you.
You're such a beautiful man. Look at you - stuck in this place, and only thinking of her.
He's ninety. He's practically dead already. How come <u>he</u> goes back and <u>I</u> stay here?
Where'd he go??
Well, when I walked up the block, I ... well, my word!
I love you, Mom.  I have to run.  You remembered to call the limousine service, right?
Well, bye.  And have a safe trip ... and ... Paris in the spring!
Here you are, Senator. Not a bad desk, either. Daniel Webster used to use it.
Give you something to shoot at, Senator--if you figure on doing any talking.
Calendar for the day. You'll find the Senate Manual in the drawer. Anything else you want, just snap for a page.
The Majority Leader? Right over there. And that's [           ] the Minority Leader. They're both pretty good in the clinches.
Right up there over the Vice- President's chair--the four in the front row represent the four big news services. You've met the press bunch, haven't you?
Look out for those fellows--they tell the truth about you--sometimes. That corner over there is reserved for guides and sightseers who come in for five minutes to rest their feet. That section over there is reserved for Senator's friends. The front row--the empty one--is for the President and White House guests-- see that old couple over there-- they've attended every session for the last twenty years. Over the clock back here is the Diplomatic section. They and the page boys are the only real class we have in this place. The rest are mostly people who come here like they go to the zoo--
All the ex-vice-Presidents. You can get ten-to-one around here if you think you can remember their names. The Vice-President presides over the Senate--you know that. It's how he earns his pay. Oh--over there, Senator-- on the east side of the Chair we still have the old snuff boxes with real snuff in them if you like snuff.
I'll take your hat into the cloak room.
Well--who d'you take this time--Paine, Bill, Carl--or McGann?
The Silver Knight. Soul of Honor--on a tight-rope.
You play--left field.
Diz!
What!
Yes, yes--tell them I'll see them immediately--immediately!  I can't hold them off! They want something to say about this appointment. Ten to one they've got a man.
I *can't* wait, McGann! You go into that room and tell Jim Taylor and Joe Paine that I give them *one more minute*--
But you went ahead and made this appointment without asking me--
*But you never asked me*!
He's the greatest *American* we got, too, Dad. Can tell what George Washington said--by heart. An' "Boy Stuff's" got the swellest stuff in it.
When Jeff gets through with Taylor, Pop--
Will the Senator yield for a question?
Mr. President--
Mr. President--I did not say that Senator Paine was one of those Congressmen I saw. If the chair please, I will deny that Senator Paine *saw* Taylor or even knows him--
Well. I hear you've been right on your toes since you got here. Pitching right in. Lots of people took you for dumb--but they're wrong. You're smart. In fact, *I* think you're smart enough to understand a situation when it's explained to you--
Well now--just to take an example-- putting up a dam--on Willet Creek. As I look at it--that dam's going to do the people of our state a lot of good--
But you have some objections here and there. And maybe right, for all I know. But the point is--there's no sense stopping the whole works now-- specially after some men have worked hard for a long time to put this through--
No, gee--I couldn't stay here--
Yes--right here. Just a second--  Miss Paine.
Get your hat, Senator. We've got a lot to do between now and tomorrow--
Ah! That's more like it! What?
A camp! Well!
The chair recognizes the rather strong- lunged junior Senator, Mr. Smith.
Marvelous! And what would this camp set the Government back?
Joe--drop everything and come with me!
What do you want, Senator?
What are you driving at? You want *me* to get him to sign that?
Why don't you do it yourself?
Well--me, too!
What are you talking about? What difference--?
All right--*yes*! And what does that make me to him? *Nothing*! I've got to go about my own business--and forget it!
*Me! Me*! I *still* don't see why I should--! If you love him so much, why don't you go to him yourself and-- ? Or better still--get up in that Senate and *fight* for him!
Jim--the boy's talking to that State-- the story is out--!
And if he can raise public opinion against us--if any *part* of this sticks--
I hit him from the floor with everything I knew!
I accuse this man--by his tone--by his careful denials--he is deliberately trying to plant damaging impressions of my conduct--! *I'll* tell you why we were in tht room. Because Mr. Taylor, a respected citizen of our State, had brought with him the evidence against this man, later presented from this floor, and *we were urging him to resign*-- !
We'd like to get in touch with him. It's very important.
Deeds! Who do you think I'm talking about?
Oh, yes.
Your Honor, this is absurd. The woman's obviously in love with him.
Well, you are in love with him, aren't you?
You are , aren't you?
I told 'em I'd play along with them if they lowered their prices - and cut down expenses - and broadcast.
Gosh, you look pretty tonight.
Huh?  Oh. They said I was crazy. Said I wanted to run it like a grocery store.
I'd rather have Mandrake Falls.
Really?
Mary, I'm going home.
In a day or so, I think.
What'll I tell him if he calls up?
You're acting like a school girl.
What're you going to do?
Tell him you're Babe Bennett? Tell him you've been making a stooge out of him?
We've got nothing to worry about. He's as naive as a child.
How is this, sir?
I wish you luck, sir.
It's a lie!
Well, your uncle was Chairman of the Board of Directors. They probably expect you to carry on.
Will you have a cigar?
Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington. Funny, I can't think of a rhyme for Budington.
Well, whenever I run across a funny name, I always like to poke around for a rhyme. Don't you?
I've got one for Cobb
Sounds like a two weeks' notice to me.
I've gotten the 'sackaroo' in many ways - but never in rhyme.
I don't remember. "Cinderella Man!" What do they mean by that?
I think I'll go down and punch this editor on the nose.
Sometimes it's the only solution.
If they're going to poke fun at me, I'm going to
But what about this "Cinderella Man"?
Yes, I guess I'll have to.
That's impossible. The opera has never paid.
Well, what about it, Mr. Deeds?
No.
Huh? On, no. Nobody important.
Uh-huh.
No, he's too fussy for that. That's what's the matter with him. There are lots of nice girls right here in Mandrake Falls who're dying to be married
He's got a lot of foolish notions - about saving a lady in distress.
No, sir.
Hey, did you hear that?
I know my time's up, but I've got to get this out while I've got hold of it --
What Ernest means, I think, is we're very interested in other methodology... different kinds of training. We're great believers in learning from each other. I've learned so much from Ern -- Dr. Delbanco...
...I won't go into that today. Though, if we should continue these sessions, as I certainly hope we will, there are some aspects of that I would like to look at. God knows, I've listened to enough people giving me the juicy --  ...At any rate, I just wanted to acknowledge the catalyzing effect your comment had on me. I just hope that it doesn't come roiling back upon you like some dreadful undertow.
What is it?
I think you'll like this. Know much about Cuban cigars?
Meat loaf, turkey quesadillas, or salad nicoise.
You do?
Lily, I want you to meet Skip. Skip, Lily.
Hello, Lionel.
What'd you want?
That's okay. Maybe it is. My mother always says -- "Everything that's wrong with you is in your head." I suppose that's true.
No... but it started one year to the day after my divorce became final. That's not too suspicious, is it?... But it wasn't like I was feeling bad about the divorce. Just the opposite.
Hmm? Is that a professional opinion?
Even if you don't think it's real?
What would you do?
I don't know. I barely made it today.
Painful lymph glands?  Forget fulness... irritability... depression?
Yeah, most people have that. It's confusing here.
-- you've been a tremendous help to me.
I can't tell you how much I admire you. You have a wonderful way with people. And you're very insightful. I feel like you've seen me clearly... I never used to admit what a horrible person my mother was. You've made that possible for me.
Yes! And my ex-husband -- he never accepted me for who I was, just like Mother. The things you've said have helped me understand what a dick he is.
You're shockingly honest, that's what makes you great. I've never had a man treat me this way. With you, I feel really... listened to.  Can I tell you something? It's a little embarrassing, but I feel very unguarded with you.
I am irate!
But nothing... I'm mad as hell. This is a terrible thing you've done.
I don't think you know what you're talking about.
I hope you don't think I want you to do this for free. Just because we're gonna play it like we're friends, doesn't mean I won't pay you like a doctor.
I have a lot of money. Do you know how much money I've got?
I've got three big ones.
Yeah, well... what I was gonna tell you --
-- an investigator for the Internal Revenue Service?
Sounds like you have several.
An IRS investigator with a drug problem?
Did you carry a gun?
I've never brought anyone down here before.
Doc, there's something about what you told me the other night I can't get out of my head. It's driving me batty --  Why me? How did you know you could trust me?
I trained in the east, myself -- Cornell -- and I don't care what anyone says, there really are regional differences. I found the state certification exams out here quite harrowing... Did you?
Which examiner did you have? I probably know him.
Personally, I would like to surrender. Why can we not just surrender?
Ten to one, O'Connell, your odds are no-so-good.
Yeah?
The key!? She has the lost key!?
Then we will kill her, we will kill her and all those with her.
It will be done. But what of the American expedition? They leave tomorrow as well.
The hell with this. I'm goin, downstairs to get me a drink. You want somethin'?
We uh,... found... your puzzle box, and we've come to ask you about it.
No?
Evil. The Tuaregs and the Bedouin believe that Hamunaptra is cursed, they call it, "the doorway to hell."
Oh my god,... it looks like, it looks like a sarcophagus.
Is he supposed to look like that?
Got it!
You told me you found it on a dig down in Thebes!
You lied to me!
I'm your sister.
You stole it from a drunk at the local Casbah?!
What do I do, Evy!? What do I do!?
None taken.
Damn-it! That's two down and only two to go.
Where are you going?
Much less go outside.
It's late. I'm headin' home.
Yes!
Yes!
Elizabeth! Little Elizabeth! Why you're so... middle aged!
How's your dad?
Thanks for reminding me which team I'm on.
I'd better go.
What?
Who?
You know what? Underneath all that anger I think there's just a little boy who wants everyone to love him.
But now Casanova's back! And we're gonna sit around here all night eating pizza and telling stories! Hey, lets toast some marshmellows!
Have you ever seen him?
Cover me!
I'm soaked.  Oh great.
He's turned into a completely normal person!
Here you go. 
Don't crunch the leaves.
Maybe it's time we checked that place out.
Well, that is a very interesting idea, General Kutusov, but I can assure you that Napoleon is no beginner at this.  Whatever analysis you have done on this situation, I am sure that he has gone over the same ground.
Well, one thing immediately comes to mind, if what you are saying is true -- he would merely withdraw his army from Moscow and return to Poland for the winter.
I must confess he would look a bit silly, fighting his way to Moscow and turning right around again.
Proceed.
But, sire, Your Majesty would lay Paris open to being sacked.  The enemy is outside the gates with more than 120,000 men.  Besides this, I left the city under the terms of a treaty and I am forbidden to reenter Paris.
I don't know the details of the treaty, sire, Marshal Mortier sent me word of its having been agreed to, and he said that I was to take the army and make for Fontainebleau.
I believe it was arranged by Marshals Mortier and Marmont.  I must explain to you that we have had no orders all day.  Each marshal has been keeping his own position.
I don't know, sire.
I don't know what has happened to Prince Joseph.
Then, you have my thanks, Captain Charles, for safely escorting Madame Bonaparte to Milan, and you may consider your assignment completed.
You will return to Paris tomorrow and you will carry my compliments and thanks to General Le Clerc for assigning such an excellent officer to carry out a responsibility which has meant so much to myself and to Madame Bonaparte.
Ah, my dear Francis, what a genuine pleasure it is to meet you at last.
I'm sorry that I am unable to offer you better hospitality, but this is the only place I have inhabited for the past month.
Shall we move closer to the fire?
I would like both of you to read this.  Please read it aloud.
Were you in love with him?
And now?
Do you expect me to believe that?
God damn it, Junot, wouldn't you think I have enough things on my mind not to waste time on a letter like this to Joseph?
Good day, monsieur.  Do you think it is possible for you to tell your driver to stop ringing that bell?
Are you trying to provoke me, monsieur?
May I inform you, monsieur, that I am Major Fidon, official courier to the court of the Emperor Napoleon, on my way to our Embassy at St. Petersburg and, in accordance with the rules of the road, no one may overtake or pass me.
If I have given you any cause to be insulted, monsieur, may I offer you immediate satisfaction?
Citizen Lieutenant, my advice is to leave this town at once with your men.  We do not wish to do harm to our brothers in uniform.
On December 2, 1804, Napoleon was made Emperor of France.  He would later say:  "I found the crown lying in the gutter and I picked it up."
That's okay, Unc.  I can't swim, either.
Where's that boy that told me Day-Day was here?
It's about to work, just come on.
Go on and make yourself at home.  I'mma go get dressed for work.
Pinky's Records and Disc in the shopping center.  I'mma talk to my boss and see if he got a little position for you.  'Cause you been unemployed for a long time now, Craig.
It says we owe $3,900...by tomorrow.
This vacuum don't work.  Where's the restroom?
Wait.
I did.  Is that door locked?
What's the matter?
Nigga, you got knock the fuck out.
Look, Roach, I know you ain't never worked in a record shop before and you're a little excited.  But if Pinky catches you doing that X-Games shit off his counter top, we both getting fired.  You feel me?
Roach, what are you doing?
Hey.
What the fuck you looking at?
William.
What about that ugly dog?
Lousy. And I have siesta hair. I'm thinking of canceling the speech.
Look...I've... I've got a problem. A big problem...
This? I've never even fired one.
Yes, yes, I understand.
You killed him.
My wife always said I had a problem trusting people.
Haven't you ever seen anybody kiss like that?
What do you do, if I may be so bold?
Why don't you tell me about the early years some other time?
Yeah, now listen.  I can't mess with these shoes any more or it's gonna look funny. You go down get yourself something to drink. Make sure Godzilla there, follows you.
Hey!
Where are we going?
I'm looking for them.
Any trouble?
He was a cool one, that Harper. Never broke.
She don't put in at Cresap's Landing no more, but she still blows as she passes. Come on in and have a cup of coffee.
Here's what you owe me.  One, two, three, four, five... where's the other basket? Where's Ruby?
What's wrong, Mother?
Willa Harper there is certain plain facts of life that adds up just like two plus two makes four and one of them is this: No woman is good enough to raise growin' youngsters alone! The Lord meant that job for two!
Ain't no sense in it, neither. I figured somethin' like this was brewin' when she went to bed last night.
She tarried around the kitchen after I'd gone up, and when I went downstairs to see what was wrong...
You swore, Pearl!
Get in the skiff, Pearl, goodness, goodness, hurry!
Why, he told me what fine little lambs you and your sister both was.
Now where, boy? Mind; no tricks. I can't abide liars.
I'm hungry.
Can I have my supper please?
Can I have milk too?
That's mighty brave of you, Reverend.
Didn't -- didn't she leave no word?
Mornin', ladies.
This gentleman warn't like them! He just give me a sody and the book.
He never asked me for nothin'.
How can you tell?
M'god, I look twenty years old.  You have any weird dreams last night?
Well at least I have an objective wall to bounce this off.  You believe it's possible to dream about what's going to happen?
You believe in the Boogey Man?
You believe in anything?
Much better.
Coming up on the seventh day. It's okay, I checked Guiness. The record's eleven, and I'll beat that if I have to.  Listen, I... I know who he is.
The killer.
Hello Nancy.
Then you know more than I do -- I haven't even been upstairs.
Who? Who did that?
No television, forget the homework, no phone calls.
And no school tomorrow, either. You take a little vacation, relax and rest for a change.
Your father the cop. That's a good one.  Forget Fred Krueger. You don't want to know, believe me.
Someone else was there.
Maybe we should call Rod, have him come over too. He might get jealous.
They didn't let me. I am in disgrace. Last week at the performance of Carmen I played a sour note. The conductor got so excited he yelled, "There's sabotage in the string section!"
I know... my heart is sad... but my feet are happy. When all the tanks and guns were roaring over the Red Square I sat here all by myself and played a Beethoven sonata. Not bad at all.  Are you expecting someone?
What are you serving?
An omelet! Aren't you living a little above your ration?
That's her.
...it may step out of a bazaar... it may wait for you in a corridor... it may hide in the shadow of a minaret....
Yes! We could stay with Leon!
This is the apartment we have reserved for you, Comrade Yakushova. I hope you like it.
Is it possible to bring you back to reality for a moment? I must have a complete report of your negotiations and a detailed expense account.
And there is a Russian saying: "The cat who has cream on his whiskers had better find good excuses."
Nonsense. How can you fight the Reds and make yourself agreeable to the Whites if you don't keep up your strength.
Only one in the rear, I'm afraid.
Leon, my little boy.
There's something in Constantinople... something irresistible....
Comrade Buljanoff...
Comrade Kopalski...
I might be able to accommodate you. Is there some more luggage?
I'm afraid we have no boxes of that size in our vault, but there is one suite with a private safe...
What's that?
...and Kopalski.
The foundation is one hundred and forty-one yards square...  I hope you'll forgive me but I thought you'd...
Thank you.
I'll tell you that joke again. A man comes into a restaurant. Did you get that?
He sits down at the table and says to the waiter... Did you get that too?
From what I read I thought champagne was a strong drink. It's very delicate. Do people ever get drunk on this?
I am so happy. No one can be so happy without being punished. I will be punished and I should be punished.  I want to confess, darling.
They wouldn't let me in so I had to get you out.
What did he say?
Hello, Leon darling!
I wouldn't waken Leon. After last night I would say not before three o'clock at the earliest.
Bring me something simple. I never think about food.
The future of the common people.
How's the job coming, Bob?
We'll see about that ...
Well, he certainly isn't acting like it.
I'm not going to be the scapegoat for this.  Haldeman and Ehrlichman are in just as deep as me.
I understand that, sir.
Martha's an idiot, she'll do anything to get John's attention.  If Mitchell'd been minding the store instead of that nut Martha we wouldn't have that kid Magruder runnin' some third-rate burglary!  Was he smoking pot?
We can't touch Hoover --
I don't know, I don't know ... I just know we've made too many enemies.
No, you're not!  You're going to claim executive privilege and you're going to stonewall it all the way -- plead the Fifth Amendment.  I don't give a shit.  They can't force the President's people to testify.
Who?
But O'Brien doesn't even use that office.  The Democrats've moved to Miami.  There's nothing there!
Their fourth!
We've got to turn off the FBI.  You just go to the CIA, Bob, and tell Helms that Howard Hunt is blackmailing the President.  Tell him that Hunt and his Cuban friends know too damn much, and if he goes public, it would be a fiasco for the CIA.  He'll know what I'm talking about.
Play it tough.  That's the way they play it and that's the way we're going to play it.  Don't lie to Helms and say there's no involvement, but just say this is sort of a comedy of errors, bizarre, without getting into it.  Say the President believes it's going to open up the whole Bay of Pigs thing again.  Tell Helms he should call the FBI, call Pat Gray, and say that we wish for the sake of the country -- don't go any further into this hanky-panky, period!
Just do what I say, Bob.
Pat Gray'll do anything we ask him. That's why I appointed him.
Christ, you're right -- Gray makes Jerry Ford look like Mozart.  Just have Helms call him.  Helms can scare anybody.
It's got nothing to do with justice. It's national security.
Alright.  But why, if Kennedy is so clean in all this, didn't he cancel Track 2?
She got it, Bob.  A nineteen-year-old college kid ...
She understood something it's taken me twenty-five fucking years in politics to understand.  The CIA, the Mafia, the Wall Street bastards ...
We've got to turn the faucet off on this thing.  It's out of control ...  You might burden just me with this in the future.
We could leverage Helms.
We haven't said grace yet.  Richard.
I suppose, "Mister President," you're unhappy that we have not implemented your Domestic Intelligence plan, but ...
Of course we've tried, but so far we've come up with nothing that ...
I'm sure you realize this is a very tricky area, Mr. President, given our charter and the congressional oversight committees ...
I want to see him tomorrow, Clyde.
Not Joaquin, you idiot.  Nixon.  Did you hear what he said in Oregon? About me having too much power.
Or he'll steal it like his brother. He's a mean little sonofabitch, Edgar ... He had the IRS audit my mother when she was dying in a nursing home.
Thanks, Jack.  You sure throw a helluva party.
Because if you're uncomfortable with the EPA up your ass, try the IRS ...
That's right!  And if necessary, I'll drop the big one.
I was asleep, Mr. President.  What can I get you?
We can prosecute the New York Times, go for an injunction ...
Get off that.  That leads nowhere. You should offer condolences to the families of those kids.
... I don't really know you yet, Sandy ... What do you like?  I mean, what kind of clothes do you like?  Do you like blue ... red?
What kind of, uh ... music do you like?
Yeah ... Guy Lombardo ...
No, they want you, Mr. President.  I really think it would be a good move.
Thank you, Fidel Castro.
I sure am.  The goddamned missile crisis united the whole country behind Kennedy.  And he was supporting Brown. People were scared, that's why.
It was our dream, too, Buddy, together ... always.
This.  Above all.
What exactly did you want to discuss, Pat?
And what am I doing?
Hiding what?
Well, in any case, Rocky, I'll send you my book.  "Six Crises."
Some say you are, Rocky.
I thought maybe she was with your boy there.
You wouldn't think a car would burn like that.
What about yours?
...This month's checks.
I'm goin' to try and keep from it as much as I can.
No.
No.
I wouldn't worry about it.
So... for how long do we have to...
Yessir?
Did you go up to his trailer?
Well I'd say he's at work. Do you want to leave a message?
I can't say.
What airport would you use.
Airport.
I don't know.
...Will there be somethin' else?
Look... I got to know what I stand to win.
How's that?
We got a loose cannon here. And we're out a bunch of money, and the other party is out his product.
Waitin' for my wife.
Half.
Lookin' for what's comin'.
Then you'll like me.
How is she?
Could I have that in American?
So, you think you're gonna find his scalp hanging in some tepee?
Did you send anyone out there?
Bad idea...
Oww... Did you have to make these things so tight?
...I s'pose you did that so I could take my sweater off or something.
Did... did you really come here because you love this guy?
Halfway where? You've gotta come home. We've been worried sick about you. Are you alright?
Betty, honey, listen to me. A man came by from Mutual Life Insurance. He says you've got money comin' to you from Del's policy.  Del's life insurance policy -- Are you with me?
Lyla's very nice.
She told me I was charming and relentless, and would go far in this town. And she said that unlike the other charming, relentless people she knew, she liked me.
Carleton School of Nursing. Two semesters, but Del made me give it up...
But I'm David... I mean, I'm not David, but she thinks I am! You heard her...  Stop staring at me... I'm not crazy, she is!
You're doing this now? After all the... are you sick? Are you going to kill me now?
Well, are you gonna answer me? What'd you come here for?
You're not on that soap opera thing again, are you? 'Cause you know what that is?
That's right. So, if you know it, why are you in trouble?
Where you headed, Betty?
And you called your friend, and she's telling you not to go?  When I went to Europe my friends told me I was crazy.
I should call you Dorothy.  When I left here I went straight to Italy. Everybody told me not to go. But I wanted to go to Rome ever since I saw Audrey Hepburn in "Roman Holiday," and goddamnit, I went.
It's something I had to do. For David.
Guess who I saw today.
Doctor David Ravell.
This isn't fair, you know. Do you always get what you want?
That won't be necessary. She's staying with a Rosa something... Hernandez, Herrera. I know it's an 'H' sound... in Silverlake.
More than you know. Is there anything else?
Could you give us an example?
I'm asking you for an example of one of these dumb fucks being a dumb fuck.
You're not a dumb fuck, are you, Del?
I didn't think so. So, give me an example of a stupid person doing a stupid thing. Not being stupid, you're equipped to recognize it.
Hold still, Del, we're just talking here...  Then you grab a big handful of hair and pull as you cut. It's amazing how easily the scalp comes off.
What the hell was that, another statement?
They said find it. Find her, find it. Finish the job you were paid to do.
What?
Well, guess what? I found Betty... where she's been, anyway.
I'm not telling.
I don't like talking bad about the dead, but now that he's gone I can tell you she put up with things in that marriage I wouldn't have. And yes, she, of all people, was the one who defended him. And that's why what that sheriff said makes me so angry.
If anyone had paid to have that husband of hers killed, it would have been me.
She makes me stretch! I got inside my character last night like I haven't done in six years on "Reason". It was a totally rejuvenating experience.
She's even taken a job as a nurse!  David Ravell's getting boring, Lyla.
Can I have an evil twin?
Oh, of course. Who can forget the Emmy?  Then let me bring Betty to the set and see what happens.
I'll tell the cast ahead of time. What do you say?
It'll be like live television! Let's live on the edge a little. You and I can break the mold here!
Fine, but promise me one thing. If we use her, I want to direct those episodes. She's my discovery.
Hmm?
You've got to be missing a piece of your soul to kill someone. That's not our Betty...
Because it ain't natural, young man.
Aren't they precious?  Ma'am, she has a substantial death benefit coming to her from the tragic loss of her husband. Does she have any relatives in the area?
I see. And are you in touch with Mrs. Sizemore?
Her show?
We ain't gonna make it walkin'.
NOW HOLD ON, BOYS-AINTCHA EVER HEARD OF A NEGOTIATION? MAYBE WE CAN TALK THIS THING OUT!
Whuhh...
'N turned into a frog -
What's his name again?
McGill. No, the marriage'll take place as planned.
Huh?! They dam that river on the 21st.  Today's the 17th!
The hell it ain't square one! Ain't no one gonna pick up three filthy unshaved hitchhikers, and one of 'em a know-it-all that can't keep his trap shut!
Pete... I do apologize.
Languishing! Goddamn campaign is languishing! We need a shot inna arm!  Hear me, boys? Inna goddamn ARM!  Election held tomorra, that sonofabitch Stokes would win it in a walk!
How was the flight? They take care of you okay? Long way from Norfolk, isn't it?
Listen, kid, I was sorry to hear about your mom. That's pretty rough. I would've returned your call a lot sooner but I was out at sea...
Who's that?
Great ass.
Better watch out for that kind, Zackie. You know what they call 'em, don't ya?
Back east in Newport, Rhode Island, they call 'em the Fall River Debs. In Pensacola, the Mobile Debs. In Norfolk --
Who?  Aw shit, Zackie, let's not get off on your mother again, please.
He doesn't mean anything by it, Zack. Do you, Joe?
You didn't kick him out...? Wait, didn't he tell you what he's been going through?
What did you call me, Mayo?
Something tells me you've been here before.
Come on, guys. It's five o'clock.
God help you, Lynette!
I shouldn't have done that. I should've walked.
There's always a choice.
I don't feel like talking, if you don't mind.
You know, sometimes I wish I was one of those girls they're letting in the flight program these days. God, I'd love to fly.
Zack, do you ever think about what it'd be like to have kids... a family.
Some day. When I'm sure I can do a better job of it than my folks.
For a start, I wouldn't marry a man I wasn't in love with.
Because my real father wouldn't marry her.
I see you didn't DOR, Mayo.
Nice, hospitable folks they get around here.  I hope she comes.
It's a big religious thing with her and she won't even discuss it.
What if she called the cops?
Are you okay?
The walls are steel, right?
NOT THAT ONE?!
Asshole.
Where did you get this clown?
What tables?  I've never seen him before.
Hey man, after all we went through I am not walking out when we're this close.
I don't have to tell you there is an acute shortage of living space in Manhattan right now and this is a highly unique property.
That's highly inappropriate.
Makes me nervous.
Ever read any Poe?
No, Edgar Allen.
"What we want is in that room."
We're never getting out of here.
Where is the Glucogen?
I'm sorry, Mom.
For the last time Boy!!! What do those guns mean??!!
What the fuck?
Go! Run! Go on! Get the fuck out of here!!
I ain't gonna shoot you Judge. Look... it's over. Just run away. Get out. Stay away from Oakland. Cause it's gone... it's gone.
Yeah... I'm fucked up. You're fucked up. Government's fucked up. Whole country's fucked up. You got no idea what's going on here. This is bigger than you and me. We're just little tiny soldiers getting moved around on some big asshole's desk. The Panthers... fuck you're history... they killed you and you don't even know it.
Drugs Judge, they're gonna flood West Oakland with dope. Jack you up and string you out like a two dollar whore. And while the community's shuffling for a fix, they're gonna snuff every Panther they can find.
...Glad you came man.
Rodgers... this is no good...
That's right brother... listen and learn.
We put our lives on the line today. Malcolm X's widow was on the line today. And your guns weren't even loaded.
Tell that to the pigs. Better yet tell that to Malcolm.
What's the pig's name?
You got to keep very cool on this. Icy god damn cool. Cause baby, you just became the strongest weapon we got. Let me guess, he wants you to call him, tell him what we're doing.
And you're gonna do just that. But I'll tell you what to feed the pig. You alright with this?
Busted firing pin.  You want only the legal stuff right?
We'll all get out of here together.
You meet those friends of yours in jail too?
I hear them boys, those Black Panthers, they're communists. They don't even believe in God.
You believe that?
Well?
Cheerful news to greet the morn.
And send us to war alongside Massachusetts.
You are familiar with how these things are done.  In fact, I would like to claim aggrieved status.
First, you have in your possession certain belongings of mine, including clothing, private papers, furniture and personal effects of a non-military nature which I would like to have returned to me.
Father, a post rider came from Charleston.  You have a letter inside.
Did your father teach you humility?
She spoke?  Susan spoke?
If this war is about more than Thomas, it's about more than Anne, as well.  Stay the course.
Wars are not fought only by childless men.  A man must weigh his personal responsibilities against his principles.
And your principles?
How far away?
Francis, tell me about General Cornwallis.
That bad?
But where are we going, Mr. Crandall?
Paxcow says it's almost too late!
That's what I think. I heard Missy Dandridge tell Mom when Church was fixed he wouldn't cross the road so much.
At school Michael McDowell said she was gonna fry in hell. Michael McDowell says all sewersides fry in hell.
How can you call it a good thing? A graveyard for pets killed in the road! Built and maintained by broken- hearted children!
Not yet...how much further is it?
Jud, this is crazy. It's going to be almost dark before we get back.
But--
Yes, but--
What are those for?
Rachel not feeling well?
The door must not be opened. The barrier must not be crossed.
She's finally asleep.
It was that place. That creepy cemetery up in the woods. Whatever disease the kids in this town have got, I don't want Ellie to catch it.
You better get going, hon.
I told you last night--this can be the start of patching things up with your folks. If something good doesn't come of Gage's death, I think I'll go crazy.
I know whose blood you need, to end the curse.
No, I really think I do.
That's proper, sir, according to the code.
Oh, there would be no sense in killing you, Miss Turner.
Elizabeth, I'm relieved you're safe.  Clap him in irons.  And behind his back this time.
You're speaking up for him again?
Difficult ... to say.
You are despicable.
That was before I met one, of course.
Well, perhaps ... with a bit more to drink, I might ...
Say again?
Jack, it's a fool's errand: You've heard the tales they tell about the Pearl.
A fool's errand.
We can at least fight -- we might be able to kill a few--
What's your name?
Do you think this is wise, boy? Crossing blades with a pirate?
We're going to steal a ship?  That ship?
It's still against the law.
But I survived.  And I still have that single shot.  It's meant for one man.  My mutinous first mate--
There's no *real* ship as can match the Interceptor.
No, it's not.
You've seen it?
You've seen the Black Pearl?
You haven't seen it.
You've seen a ship with black sails that's crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that hell itself spat him back out?
No.
Oh, and no ship that's not crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that hell itself spat him back out could possibly have black sails and therefore couldn't possibly be any ship other than the Black Pearl.  Is that what you're saying?
Mr. Sim, when you do locate him.  Do not scare him off again.  Just watch him.  I think you can handle that. Right, Mr. Sim?
I brought you up here, Dr. Bright, because I want you to understand that we are on the path.  The only difference is that you are walking with your head down, afraid to look up, to see where the path is going.
How apropos.
It works, Poppy.  It works, it works!
But, Poppy, you don't know what this means --
Yes, that's true.  We have to find him, run tests, determine if the polymerization is stable.
Oh no.  No.  We'll get her assistant.  What's-his-name? Nebbishman?
It will be an ascension.
They're here!  They're here!  We have the nanobot.
Do you remember about five years ago, that uh... incident at Purnell Labs?
They also tried using viral R.N.A. as the bonding element.
You want to tell me what I'm looking for?
Yeah.
You don't know?
But you've polymerized single-celled bacteria and the fruit flies, I know you have.
That was an egg?
What do these replicators do to people?
Just like old times.
You made this out of my hair?
That means the nanobot is still inside him.
What would happen if I threw him into the core?
Maybe you're ready to find out if that hide of yours is bulletproof?
It might be paranoia, but I've never lost my keycard before.
I'm sure you're quite willing to be decent about this.
I suppose you're going to print them?
Why should I? We're happy, aren't we, darling?
None of your ideas can be goofy, Stew, if they concern me.
Oh, yes you will my dear - oh, yes you will my dear - you'll wear garters and you'll like it too!
I'm not going!
I'm talking about - I'm not going out.
Go downstairs, and tell them - anything. Tell them I'm not going. Tell them I'm not home.
It's a good thing your father passed away before he saw insanity ravage the family. I can't imagine what made you do such a thing. A reporter! Of all things, a reporter! A barbarian who lets his socks come down!
I got him his job on the paper. I'm a stock-holder, you know.
Big Chief Bingy come to white man's tepee to make friends. Big Chief very sorry. To show how sorry - will bend over and let white man kick Big Chief where sun never shines.
Mr. Schuyler .
Is that so?
All right, outside!
Well, I've seen her pictures, and I don't think she's so hot.
Mr. Smith, I've read some of your plays and I'd like an autograph.
There you are!
I'm pinch-hitting for our society editor tonight. I wanted to see some life in the raw.
Well, I'll have to look someplace else.
Stewart, have you ever been to Old Madrid?
To Old Madrid.
Then how do you expect to write about it?
Well, well. That takes it out of the rumor class, doesn't it?
Yes.
Dexter Grayson, you told me it was only ten thousandand you didn't even get those letters from that Jezebel!
Now, now Jeeves.[5] Was that nice? Was that being a gentleman, Jeeves? Was it, Jeeves? Your name is Jeeves, isn't it?
Smythe! Well, well, well! With a Y , huh?  Congratulations! What a small world. Brothers under livery. Shake!  Now, as a Smith to a Smythe
It isn't done, gentlemen! It isn't done, I say! It isn't done!
Bu-ud ... Mary Sue ... Your breakfast is getting cold.
I'm so proud of you, Bud.
What is that?
Okay--now you listen to me ...  You're gonna come to this meeting and you're gonna put on this make up, and you're gonna come home at six o'clock every night and have dinner ready on this table.
It's s'posed to happen, Biff.
Want some bridge mix?
Betty's making some pineapple kabobs ...
Bud Parker and William Johnson, you have been charged with desecration of a public building and the intentional use of prohibited paint colors in violation of the Pleasantville Code of Conduct and laws of common decency. Do you admit that on the night of May 1, you did consciously and willfully apply the following FORBIDDEN colors to the Pleasantville Town Hall:  Red, Pink, Vermillion, Puce, Chartreuse, Umber, Blue, Aqua, Ox Blood, Green, Peach, Crimson, Yellow, Olive and Magenta.
What's outside of Pleasantville?
Oh my God.
No way.
It's too weird David. This place is giving me the creeps. Did you know all the books are blank?
I looked in the library. They got covers with nothing inside them.
I had nothing to do with that fire.
Not directly anyhow ...
You got the admissions letter.
And you're sure about this?
You want some berries?
Salesman. What did Bud and Mary Sue name the cat they found in the gutter?
Look--we appreciate it. We really do. We just--we want to go home now.
Hope you're proud of yourself.
There aren't any cheeseburgers.
Well, usually I put out the burger and then you finish with the lettuce ...
Oh, hi.
Aren't you a little early?
Free?
...yes I'm still on hold...
I'm looking at your advertisement for the airline promotion and giveaway?
It's hard to understand because it says in addition to but I can't exactly understand in addition to what because there's actually nothing to add it too...
So, just to clarify, I'm sorry: Ten purchases of any of your Healthy Choice products equals five hundred miles and then with the coupon the same purchases would value one thousand miles --
Do you realize that the monetary value of this promotion and the prize is potentially worth more than the purchases?
It's not cool?
-- do you think you'll ask her out?
Are you gonna do it?
You don't do anything, why are you being scared?
I'm not gonna rag you. Why would I do this just to rag you?
I'll leave then, I'll go to get something from my car, go away so you don't feel pressure. Can I ask you a serious question:
Did you ask Walter to get you a shrink?  Barry, did you ask Walter to get you a shrink? What's wrong with you? Are you ok?
So you think you can?
Should I call back and talk to your girlfriend?
Business is good, you're busy?
I saw a picture of you.
Do you have brothers or sisters?
That must be nice. That must be really, really, really great.
That's very nice. Thank you. Thank you for saying that.  You're friends with my sister?
How long have you known her?
You like her?
Did you really come to meet me on purpose or are you lying about that?
That's nice. It's nice.  I've been looking around a lot lately at promotional giveaways, cross promotional work by some companies. Do you remember all that pudding?
So that pudding was bought, I bought that pudding because of a pretty interesting promotion that's sponsored by Healthy Choice and American Airlines. It's designed to encourage airline travel and obviously designed to encourage buying Healthy Choice products. They make frozen meals, deli meats, pasta sauce, breads, soups and ice creams, this sort of thing.....
....I'm sorry....I lost my thoughts, what I was saying....
-- the promotion says: buy any 10 Healthy Choice products and get 500 miles of airline travel or 1,000 for purchases made with a special coupon. So in the supermarket, you notice their products, first you notice they have a Teriyaki Chicken Dinner at $1.79 - that's a pretty good deal....but then I noticed they had soup at 89 cents a can.....and you start to do the math and you start to notice that it's a really amazing deal because I stumbled across the pudding at 25 cents a cup. Now the crucial thing is the bar codes on the label. That's those little bar codes, you know? The universal product codes?
That's what's used to redeem the mileage, so in noticing the pudding, each cup had an individual bar code -- in other words: Two dollars and fifty cents for ten cups of pudding is 500 miles. Add in the coupon: it's one thousand. You see?
You see?
You see if you spent $3,000 dollars on pudding you could earn over one million frequent flyer miles.
....yeah....
....No....
No I didn't say that.
My friend Carlos is doing it who works with me. It's his. It's his pudding, he's doing it. It's not mine. He's crazy. I told him not to do it. He's the one who's insane. He only spent about one hundred dollars so far though --
Do you wanna have sex?
Yeah.
No.
No.
I don't know.
I cut myself.
On my knife.
I didn't do that.
Your hand is bleeding.
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
Sir, I have no way of proving that you demolished the bathroom --
Alright, well you're gonna have to leave. You're gonna have to go.
I'm gonna call the police then, sir.
The police are on their way.
How many sisters do you have?
Why is it here? Barry....Barry?
Hey.
I need to talk to you for a second.
Your expenses are your own.
-- she didn't know what she was talking about --
Are you ready?
Marquis? Is that you?
Ow!
I put myself in his stories. I play the parts. Each strumpet, each murderess.
Free his mouth.
I must grant him his last rites.
Perhaps -- in time -- you'll earn them back through good behavior --
OFF WITH YOUR CLOTHES!
I DO NOT MEAN TO FLIRT, MARQUIS!
Indiscretions, Abbe? Please. I've read his case history. At sixteen, he violated a serving girl with a crucifix. After six months in the dungeon at Vincennes, he mutilated a prostitute, cutting her flesh with a razor, then cauterizing the wounds with wax --
He's more than a patient, Doctor; the Marquis is my friend --
I have.
My, my. You have exceeded my expectations.
How is the patient faring?
And you? It must've been an ordeal.
Will you sleep soundly tonight?
Quickly, my suckling, out of your clothes! My scepter awaits; how solid it grows!
If only these coins purchased your other talents, too.
You've already stolen my heart, as well as another more prominent organ, south of the Equator...
The Abbe's sending me away. He fears for me here, what with the likes of you --
He's a man of God; he's true to his vows.
If you're truly determined to step out of the shadow of your husband's celebrity --
-- words alone are insufficient.
I beg you, Donatien... as your wife... your only ally... you must stop making such a monstrous spectacle of yourself.
To flaunt your deviance in public? Upon a stage?
God, these parties are the worst
That's why he has the parties, he says it's like bringing the world to me.
Mm. Not a very good picture I am told.
Apparently it details the exploits of a publisher like myself. Entirely too much like myself. Do you follow so far?
How does one get 125 million dollars in debt?
I want blood
That's right, fella, no Hearst paper will run an RKO ad until you agree that CITIZEN KANE will never see the light of day.
Nix, sweetie. You shelve it
And Mr. Hearst has authorized me to tell you that you're looking at the most beautiful lawsuit in history if you release this picture. He'll bleed your little studio dry and you can all go on back to New York and do Shakespeare with the Boy Wonder.
"In Xanadu did Kubla Khan a stately pleasure dome decree. . . "How big is it, all told? The estate?
Jesus
So, who is he? We have to know him.
How?
Did I ever tell you about my father?
You know, all this nightmare we went through with Hearst. The whole thing... And in the end, probably no one will ever remember the picture anyway.
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud.
Listen to me. The press ban is killing us and the distributors won't book it. And meantime I'm dealing with the stockholders in New York who are scared shitless -- and I'm this far from getting fired myself -- and you don't have a friend in the world but me right now. So you have got to trust that I'll do what I can to--
Well it' s all you've got !
For Christ's sake, shut up--
How dare you talk to me like that! Do you think I'm like all the rest of those pirates?! Like Mayer and Warner? Is that what you think--?!
How 'bout a real drink?
Where you going at this hour?
You fuckin' worm, if you're going out, I'm going out.
Who's that?
Whadda ya mean, whadda I care? Who is she? What's a matter? You afraid I'm gonna take her on you?
Yeah --
Go 'head.
How do you know? You know her that good?
Excuse me for a minute. Be right back.
You givin' me that look. I gotta accept your word, but if I find out anythin', I'm gonna kill somebody...
What do you mean, "you"?
What do you mean, "you"?
But you said "you."
Eh, Joey, even you don't know what you meant. You mentioned Salvy, Tommy Como, you -- that means somethin'. Why'd you say them? You coulda said anybody.
Did you ever fuck my wife?
I don't mean now. I mean before -- before we met.
Did you ever fuck my wife?
You're very smart, Joey, very smart. Nobody gives me a straight answer around here. You're givin' me these answers, but you still didn't answer my question. Did you fuck Vickie?
Joey said you wanted to meet me. Is that right? You wanted to meet me?
You wanted to say hello, eh? I can't believe it. When did you fall outa heaven? Anyone ever tell you you're the most beautiful one here, princess of the pool. You got a baby face. Look at mine. Whatcha wanna meet me for?
Now take the rest off.
Where you been all day?
I called. You weren't there.
What'd you see?
What'd you see?
What was it about?
Did you ever go to the Copa when I was away?
Answer me when I talk to you. What happened that night?
I'm sorry. I had to work late last night. Slept at the club.
Sure, what else is new?
Hey, leave the kids alone.
Like disposing of their wives?
Feel a little foolish?
If I'd been careful piloting that reconnaissance plane, you wouldn't have taken the kind of pictures that got you a medal, a big job, fame, money --
Hello.
It's very simple. She belongs in that rarefied atmosphere of Park Avenue, expensive restaurants, and literary cocktail parties.
What about this morning? Any developments?
Thank heaven that's over!
What about the rest?
Big enough?
If you're saying all this just because you don't want to tell me the truth, because you're hiding something from me, then maybe I can understand --
It doesn't make sense to me. What's so different about it here from over there, or any place you go, that one person couldn't live in both places just as easily?
What is it but traveling from one place to another, taking pictures? It's just like being a tourist on an endless vacation.
Don't you ever have any problems?
So do I.
Why would a man leave his apartment three times, on a rainy night, with a suitcase? And come back three times?
Not that salesman's wife. And why didn't he go to work today?
What's interesting about a butcher's knife and a small saw wrapped up in a newspaper?
Why hasn't he gone into his wife's bedroom all day?
Well, I guess it's safe to put on some lights now.
I'll trade you -- my feminine intuition for a bed for the night.
Do you think this was worth waiting all day to see?
Steady Marlon!
You satisfied or you want more?
Tell him why we moved here.
You can't protect me.
You buy me many things.  Thank you.
Well, just get it off your chest, son.
You're absolutely right!
Luck, Jim.  Don't forget.
No thanks, I don't smoke.
Who's there?  Anyone there?
Excuse me--but--You know where I can find--I mean I don't remember his last name--
Are you really going to meet them?
What?
Haven't you noticed your personality splitting?
No.
'Bye, Mom.
Get lost.
Wash up and go home.
Plato!
Where you going?
Where can we go?  I can't go back into that zoo.
Is this what it's like to love somebody?
Funny Jimmy.  You're so clean and you--this is silly.
You smell like baby powder.
I never felt so clean before.
I love somebody.  All the time I've been looking for someone to love me and now--I love somebody.  And it's so easy.  Why is it easy now?
Judy--we're ready for you now.
What?
I guess I just don't understand anything.
Why?
He wants... your "sister"...
Thought you wrote you had a mustache.
You forget where I work?
Get the hell off of me!
Get your own room, Ashley.
I'm going to have to be inside that casino. When it happens. I'll need to be part of it. I can't just be drawing some map.
We need to find a way to make me part of it.
You said Merry Christmas, Rudy.
No --
But I never said Rudy.
You knew the place --
Rather be back in the Mountain?
He thought I was some gambler... he didn't know me... he didn't recognize me!
Can't be attracting attention, right?
He won't tell us where it is. The Powwow Safe.
Goddamn, Merlin. There any part of the day you don't smoke?
Cancer-sucker.
What the hell was that about --
She's gonna be out there, man. Right there. Right there waiting.
Gonna walk out of this shitstorm and right into her arms.
Got us a motel out Highway 5, bringing her own damn sheets, you read that part? Silk damn sheets. Lock ourselves in the whole week, drinking wine, taking baths, man, see if they got those room service steaks... anything I want to do. Remember when she wrote that? Anything I want...
Don't move, Rudy!
Switch seats with me.
You're taking my money. Switch seats with me. Switch seats with me if you're not taking my money --
Then get yourself another table! You're hitting Santa's cards and you're taking Santa's money!
Seymour Scagnetti.
He is a motherfucker. He won't let me leave the halfway house till I get some piece of shit job.
Now Vic was tellin' me, he's got a parole problem.
The black Beverly Hills. I knew this lady from Ladora Heights once.  "Hi, I'm from Ladora Heights, it's the black Beverly Hills."
I was in the sixth grade when that show was on. I totally dug it. What the fuck was the name of the chick who played Christie Love?
No, it wasn't Pam Grier, Pam Grier was the other one. Pam Grier made the movies. Christie Love was like a Pam Grier TV show, without Pam Grier.
Let's go over it. Where are you?
Mr. Brown?
Mr. Blonde and Mr. Blue?
Then one day she meets a John Holmes motherfucker, and it's like, whoa baby. This mother fucker's like Charles Bronson in "The Great Escape." He's diggin' tunnels. Now she's gettin' this serious dick action, she's feelin' something she ain't felt since forever. Pain.
No, she did it. She killed the cheatin' wife, too.
Aren't you?
I told 'em not to touch the alarm. They touched it. I blew 'em full of holes. If they hadn't done what I told 'em not it, they'd still be alive.
I don't even know a Jew who'd have the balls to say that. So let's get this straight. You never ever tip?
I gotta take a squirt, where's the commode in this dungeon?
Both of you two assholes knock it the fuck off and calm down!
Cut the bullshit, we ain't on a fuckin' playground!  I don't believe this shit, both of you got ten years on me, and I'm the only one actin like a professional. You guys act like a bunch of fuckin' niggers. You ever work a job with a bunch of niggers? They're just like you two, always fightin', always sayin' they're gonna kill one another.
Then. That time has passed. Right now, Mr. Blonde is the only one I completely trust. He's too fuckin' homicidal to be workin' with the cops.
You don't know how good it is to see you.
What's the matter with her?
Learnin' to read has nothing to do with the right or the wrong side of the street.
They're stragglin'.
Better go on back and get some more sleep. You'll need it later on.
All my clothes --
Where you going?
Who's Lednov?
Where'd they go?
Come on. We got a couple hours to eat and get some sleep.
Kind of feeling your oats this morning. I haven't laid a hand on you for quite a while, but that doesn't mean you're too old.
Yeah, how did you know?
She mustn't -- don't you let her --
Suppose I take a look.
I tried my best, but these things take time.
How do you know who we are?
Pleased to meet you, ma'am.  We found your trunk. Were you doin' the driven'?
And that's tough, isn't it?
For the last ten miles I've been trying to figure out how to sleep sitting up. I'm getting to the point where I don't think there's any place named Sonora.
And remember that trip we took to Africa? That safari was so wonderful. Me, you... best of friends... forever.
Oh... I guess I'll die now.
Cindy, what's going on?
But, hey, maybe we can be friends.
Cindy, I've been thinking about this whole friend thing. I never had a friend that cares for me the way you do... I mean, there's Ray, but he cares for me in a different way. You know, bringing me flowers. Running my bath water. And then there's nights I wake up screaming and I look over and Ray's in my bed. Holding me. And seeing that tonight might be our last night together, I was thinking...
Yes...
Stop it! I'm just trying to say I think we should take our friendship to the next level.
I don't want to be your friend like this anymore.
You know, walking on the beach, holding hands, kissing, making love...
How about these buns?
Tell me, Cindy. Would you ever tell me "Stop. If you loved me you'd stop."
Father!
Yes, we made it!
Me and my friends... You see there was this ghost. He came out of nowhere and....
Hey, y'all! What's going on?
I take it you're not mad at me.
I have taken care of everything, including medical supplies and blood storage. We want to be safe.
Professor!
Would you please focus?
I can do it myself.
It's the best seat in the house. I warmed it up for you.
Remember, don't ask her too many questions.
"Ray!"
"Ray!"
Bring her home... I guess.
You'd probably date him!  He's cu-uuute! Hey, Dad, did you ever see "Henry, Portrait of a Serial Killer?"
You kids. Now Birdie, I want you to have a cookie and then run along home.
Detectives, what is this about?
Look at this!  "Hillside Strangler gets his college degree in prison!"
Let's say grace and pray that we have the strength to understand the terrible tragedies of the last few days.
Hello.
Goddamn you! STOP CALLING HERE!
You bitch!
The police are tracing your call right this minute.
So you do drink?
I'm stoodup! I'll kill that bastard!
Mrs. Ackerman, when you left me at the flea-market, where did you go?
Did Carl Padgett buy something you wanted?
Carl Padgett died for the Franklin Mint, didn't he?!
What was that?
Dr. Sutphin said no sweets for you.
We can't stand here all night.
How much does she want?
I'll give you a check.
What did she want?
What were you talking about?
Nothing! That's absurd. I heard you laughing and talking, She was asking questions.
And that was all?
What did she want to know?
What brought you down here, Greg?
I've never loved any one before, Gregory, and I do love you - you must know it -- but Jacqueline's my sister  whom I had lost and have found again....   
Who are you?
No!
And you don't want to die. I've always wanted to die -- always.
Look. I'm serious. It's a real and vary earnest society -- a dangerous society...
Ah, my Jason -- always laughing -- always trying to help others.  He's a good boy, Miss -- he just talks that way.
What was she to you?
I think I understand without your telling me. I know something of your history, Jason. I know that you haven't written for ten years.
If you like, I'll go with you to dinner.
I was a great dancer...
Life has betrayed us. We've found there is no heaven on earth, so we must worship evil for evil's own sake. We're not wicked. We commit no violence, unless...
No, you draw no secrets from me, as you drew them from Jacqueline. You are not one of us yet. You're clever, Louis, but I recognize your interest in me for what it is worth. You are only curious. You have never loved a woman who had but one arm.
If I were you, Mary -- I'd go back to school. I'd make no further attempt to find Jacqueline.
Fo come ti pare. To desiderare sempre di vedere che cosa c'era in quella stanza.
Jacqueline, you have spoken so often of ending it all, I can't understand why this should be so difficult for you. You have only to drink a little.
Why'd you drop out?
That's hard to believe. The two of you seem so different.
Do you understand what I'm trying to say?
Because I enjoy interviewing women more than men.
Yes.
No.
You don't know what I'm thinking.
You're really never going to make love again?
That's the first thing that ran through my mind when I saw you. I thought this is not the same man that rode the unicycle naked through the homecoming parade.
Where did you go when you left here?
Are you afraid of his reaction? Of his finding you silly for thinking of such things?
What upsets you about that?
But he asked you to quit your job, and you do have housework.
This unexpected visit notwithstanding, how are things with John?
Is he? Strange, I mean?
Uh-huh. So what's he look like?
I just want to know what he looks like, is all.
So what's my share of the dress?
Oh, okay. I think I get it.
Well, they must be something sexual, because Ann gets freaked out by that shit. Are these tapes of you having sex with these girls or something?
Well, either you are or you aren't. Which is it?
Doing what?
About what?
What makes you think I'd discuss that with you?
You just want to ask me questions?
And that's all?
Is this how you get off or something? Taping women talking about their sexual experiences?
Would anybody else see the tape?
How do we start?
And you ask questions, right?
How long will it take?
Can I see some of the other tapes to get an idea of what --
Do I sit or stand?
I'd rather sit. Are you ready?
I wish you'd quit that bartending job.
I hate the thought of guys hitting on you all the time.
Who said I was jealous?
I felt like it, so what? Goddam, you and Ann make such a big deal out of it.
Of course. She is my sister. I tell her almost everything.
Why not?
She's a grown-up, she can handle it.
Hung up.
No.
It won't. I trust him.
Yeah, I do. A helluva lot more than I trust you.
Exactly what I said. I'd trust him before I'd trust you. How much clearer can I be?
Oh, please. Come on, John. You're fucking your wife's sister and you hardly been married a year. You're a liar. But at least I know you're a liar. It's the people that don't know, like Ann, that have to watch out.
That's right. But I never took a vow in front of God and everybody to be "faithful" to my sister.
Actually, no, I've changed my mind. I shouldn't have called.
Give me your keys.
C'mon, let's smoke one of the cigarettes right now. Your father'll never miss it.
OK, then. I'm gonna go back to the store and buy my own pack and smoke 'em all myself.
Roger? If you're going to be staying here anyway, why don't you come up to my place for a late supper?
What happened?
Right. It's crazy. But here's the beauty part. Ready?  Who cares?

No, we're from San Diego. Why?
Hang on. Did you ever know a Derek Sommersby?
Miles.
How's the trip?
Actually there is word. I spoke to Keith Kurtzman this morning.
And... they're passing. Conundrum's passing. He said they really liked it. They really wanted to do it, but they just couldn't figure out how to market it. He said it was a tough call.
Two years ago, buddy.
I can explain.
Oh, that's tasty.
Pinot Noir? How come it's white? Doesn't noir mean dark?
Just tell me.
Hey, Miles. I really hope your novel sells.
Are you chewing gum?
Have you no shame?
You know how often these pourers get hit on?  I'm going for a swim. Get the blood flowing. Want to come?
Later.
Listen, I'm going to make sure Steph and Siena get home safe, and then maybe we'll hook up with you later, okay?
Fucker hit into us.
Do you like them?
She gets off in an hour, so I think I'm just going to have a drink and then... make sure she gets home safe.
What's wrong?
Yeah, I know what you mean. It's a long drive up here. Where're you staying?
Wow. We gotta give it a moment, but this is tasty. Really good. How about you?
You guys should stop by the restaurant for lunch today.
About two-thirty.
Where are you?
Cabernet Franc.  This is only the fifth year we've made this varietal. Very few wineries around here do a straight Cabernet Franc. It's from our vineyard up in Santa Maria. And it was a Silver Medal winner at Paso Robles last year.
A famous actor who's getting married next week.
There's dust in it.
A hair.
Hi sweetie.
I cursed.
Do you feel comforted?
He was only a year and half old.
He's not strong enough to fight off another attack.
So the aliens can't read our minds.
Stop crying!
I don't think so.
They think these look like stages immediately proceeding an attack maneuver.
Well, no, not exactly. See then his friend opened up on me.
Maybe we'll see you sometime.
More than enough.
Hobart, what are you people doing here?
Well, they're wrong. This territory is full of bad characters.
What's Turley like?
They got a saloon there?
Women?
I'll see you around.
It was not -- it was Murdo's. Those McKendricks don't know how to act like human beings.
What are you talking about?
You can't do this.
Why him?
This is mighty sweet, Paden. I think I finally found my place in the world.
What a waste. This could have been such a sweet deal for us.
Where's the dog now?
But not everyone's imaginary, are they, Mr. Taransky?  I refer, of course, to Edith.
You're not renewing my contract.
I got them to remove the reflection.  The mirror's metaphor -- to show how her character's inwardly dead.
Viktor, do you realize you always do that?
Whenever I compliment Simone, you take the credit.
Yes, you do...  Anyway, tonight was a good start.
I was thinking -- what about you and... "Simone" moving back in with me and Lainey?
Thank God for you, Faith.  I know this is above and beyond the call of duty for a stand-in.  You don't know what a service you're performing for Simone -- shielding her from those animals.
Nicola Anders is the only actress who can play that role.
You have to see her.
Not like this --
-- We call them "vactors".
-- Flesh is weak.
Can't you stop that?
Those things can be dangerous. Staring at a screen all day -- you miss what's going on outside in the real world.  You can lose yourself. You should get out more.  How are you going to meet boys?
Really?  Who?  Where do you meet them?  In a chat room?  How do you know he's not some middle-aged freak?
Okay.  But you have to find a way to escape that thing.
How?
You do?  Still?  I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that.
-- I can't accept it.  I don't want a car, Dad.
The old Viktor Taransky.  I liked you better before -- before all this.  You were a loser, Dad, but at least you had integrity.  I can't stand to see you like this -- clinging to Simone's coattails -- it used to be about the work, and now it's all about her.  And then she's not even grateful enough to thank you.
There you go again, blaming yourself.  Can't you see what she's done to you -- she's taking advantage, mocking you.  You deserve better than Simone.  I've got to go, Dad.
What is it exactly you want, Sayer?
Am I wasting my time with you? When she sues to protect her privacy, she'll have to appear in a public courtroom to do it.
No one came in or went out just like you said, Mr. Taransky.
Is Miss Simone coming today?
What if it catches on fire?
See beyond that irrational allegiance to flesh and blood. -- See that with the rise in price of a real actor and the fall in price of a fake, the scales have tipped in favor of the fake.  -- See that if the performance is genuine, it doesn't matter if the actor is real.  Once a performance is committed to film, the blood and bones are gone anyway.  Only the spirit, the illusion remains. Besides, what's real anymore? These days most actors have digital work done to them so it's a gray area.
The only real truth is in the work.
Goodnight, Malcolm.
I'm going to see you again, right?
You said the "s" word.
I don't know how the story ends. I hope it's a happy ending.
--What?
I wish I were somewhere else.
Communicate?
She wanted me to tell you--
Stuttering Stanley!
Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley!
Stuttering--
Yo. "Billy Bob". Was I two beats behind, or what?
See?
Fuck you! If you're such an expert on music, why don't you go get your dueling banjo and sit in on the next song?
Aha. The Lovers.
Thought your boy and his band were only staying the night.
You're out of your mind, man.
Carl! Oh Carrrrl!
You'll be back.
Jesus. What a bunch of useless zombies.
Try taking a left after the next cow pasture.
Think of it... as a threesome. You. Me. And... "Jethro."
Get out of here.
Where's Mac?
Don't worry. The lurker ain't around. I checked.
Sorry.
No reception out here.
What's she see in that douchebag?
Rorschach.
You're lookin' awful pretty.
Where are you going?
That's not true -- Where are you--?
Now he's here. He went in Mr. Grant.
What's he get if he wins here?
So tell me about yourself.
Well?
Mississippi's the other way!
My very words.
What are you thinking?
Twenty-eight hours! You're outta your gord.
That means we gotta average ninety- four miles per.  Forget it.
Or in the slammer.
Liquid gold.
I hope that's you, buddy; 'cause I'd hate to start believing in ghosts.
She's losing minutes so you better start running interference or we're never gonna make it. Might I remind you this was your brainstorm.
Ran into a little hassle at the eatum- up-stop.
Just fine. What's the weather like?
Breaker. Breaker.
Thanks for the break. Bandit, this here's the Dixie Chicken.
Bandit II. We'll be back on the highway in a second. Over.
-- Breaker, Breaker. This is Banana Peel.
-- Did ya hear they nailed the Bandit?
Unreal, this guys jacket too. Wall- to-wall major felony offenses, murder, extortion, arson, grand larceny --  -- A paternity suit... I just feel like we're playing catch-up with all this and we shouldn't be.
Who?
-- Forget about the tissue damage you're doing to the heart itself. Sustained cocaine abuse will segue you from a very painful ventricular fibrillation into full cardiac arrest.  Buddy, nobody knows about your condition, or your drug use. Why you lied to me, knowing that I'd find out anyway, I'll never know, but it imperative now that I see you.
There are certain meds, certain intravenous measures that can counteract some of the damage you've done, but I'd have to administer them myself.
No. Sorry comes later, when you're in a partial coma with ambulatory paralysis. Sorry comes when we have to decide which of your limbs have to be amputated because severely constricted blood flow has brought about a gangrenous infection, sorry --
Jesus Hugo! How is it that you can turn a simple conversation into a fucking hedge maze!? This is zero degree of difficulty man!
Y'ain't never had to wash another man's blood off, dig it out y'fingernails... Y'had us for that. Y'ain't ever made a real beef on y'own, shit as light in the ass as you are, I'll bet you ain't ever made anything more than a fuck'n fist your whole life.  So if you think I'mma let your lil' punk-ass, with the dirt I've done for you, in the eleventh hour, sell me off like some fucking field nigger, hand me up to the Feds like y'last chip, then you done gone straight out-your-motherfucking MIND!
On an extradition flight back to El Salvador, he murdered a security detachment and vanished.
...Are you insane?
... Jesus... what for?
Wow.
Yeah, there's a pair'a broads I'm thinking might be good for this.
That's not a problem. Are we goin' outta pocket ourselves?
Well just so I got a quote in my head. What's the rate for the Swede?
Shoot.
No shit.
When them tricks hit the lobby, holla at me and I'm gonna meet them on the way up, blend in. Once I get inside, I'mma put m'Nina to Israel's head and back out hot. Anybody's fucks with that program, y'break 'em off. They get gully --
Jus' remember, this is more rescuin' shit than rampagin' shit... What are you shootin'?
I DON'T KNOW!
No.  There's no behavior modification.
Is there anybody else here?
Gibarian warned me.  He left me a message.
We can liquidate the station.  Take the Athena back.
Of course, when we return, we'll be regarded as lunatics if we tell the truth.  We'll chalk it up to isolation, collective derangement.
Well, I think we're reaching the point of diminishing returns here, right?  Certainly it's learning more about us than we'll ever learn about it.
Perhaps it did.
I need to see Snow.
Is it a planet?
Is it intelligent?
Then it's God, right?
You still don't believe in God?
Even a God that wasn't active, that just created something and stood back and watched?
Do you have any idea how much I like fucking you?
But we fought.
Why did she do it?
Was she right?
I'm not Rheya.  You've always known that.
He won't do it.
It's terrific Win.
Occasionally.
Put it on my account, please.
You mean to tell me, a mugger would stay away from someone because they walked a certain way?
Stop, will you?!
Stop being nuts!
I do care about you!
What a memory.
Do you?
You still going away?
You don't have to, now.
Mom, what's going to happen with you and Dad?
Changing the sparks.  They showed it on TV.  What d'you think?
Mike, take it easy...
It's not your fault.  Mike, please get off the case.
Did you hear what I said?
Ellie...
Let's go.  We're takin' her home!  Move it!  Get the cars!
We'll call SWAT.  We'll get the locals.  Throw it!
You're not going to talk to anyone without a lawyer.
No, I will not step outside.
God!  Scrambled eggs surprise?! These are pickles...!  God!
Peter-- you took this picture?
Mistake?  Hey, guy, get back here!
Oh, I need your notes from the classes I missed.
Thank you.  Now, repeat after me-- Spider-Man is a good guy. On the side of right, and niceness, and cute baby animals and all that.
It's never too early to be clever. Describe in a sentence how you feel about me.
Fill in the blank: "I blank Elizabeth Allan."
Uh is a good start.
Brrr.  It's colder than New Hampshire in here.
Hello, Liz.
I... I like you.  A lot.
There's nothing in there worth stealing!
Peter, you're bleeding.
Oh, Ben gets through everything.
I was napping on the couch.  There was a voice and a shot.  I woke up. Ben was looking at me.
No.  No thank you.  I have work.
Need any more help?
You're sure you're all right.
Logic.  Lot 49 is the closest stockpile of SL 270--  I do feel foolish talking with a man dressed like a--
Excuse me if I'm impertinent, but-- how did you become whatever it is you are?
He'll try to finish his experiment.
A messianic complex is nothing new to Octavius. In  his universe, there's only one mind-- his own. It must be very lonely.
Maybe just a hint or so. Think hard.
What's the matter? You on their team now? You think I'm the guy?
Static is right! The radio's static, Patton's static, we're static!
Put me down for ten, you louse.
That's the general idea.  Only it's not so general as far as I'm concerned.
I didn't do it. I was in the Frankfurt station and the train was three miles away when it blew up.
Hey, Schulz! I got a deal for you. Suppose you help us escape. We'll go home and have everything ready for you in Madison Square Garden. For the world championship! Schulz, the Beast of Bavaria versus Halitosis Jones!
Let me go! Let me go!
Schnickelfritz! I told you Schnickelfritz! Why'd you make me bet on Equipoise!
There, Joey -- ain't that better than being a lawyer?
Wait a minute. We have some rights here.  Why is this man being taken out?
No volunteers, Price. I said we're all in on it.
What's the big idea, Sefton? Take that telescope out of here.
Says me.
Go on.
When the Krauts find that gadget they'll throw us all in the boob.
Which one of us is the informer?
What's the matter with you? You want to be killed?
That wouldn't be the cigarettes you took us for last night?
Where is he now?
Fear is a very difficult emotion to overcome. It's something we all have to learn to deal with.
No. And what you must try to avoid is becoming consumed by another emotion which I believe you're beginning to experience: guilt.
Is she still angry?
Sensors show five life signs aboard the station, Captain.
Guinan. It's important that you tell me what you know. We think Soran's developed a weapon...a terrible weapon. It might give him enough power to-
Well, may we have a look around?
Antonia?
Captain, it may be possible to simulate a torpedo blast using a resonance burst from the main deflector dish.
Sir?
Well, with all due respect to your Betazoid senses, I prefer to be alone right now.
I've spent eighty years looking for another way, Captain. This is the only one.  Of course, you could always come with me. You fancy yourself an explorer. Here's a chance to explore something no human has ever experienced.
They have found a way to penetrate our shields.
Will we get another ship?
Sir, the shields... Non- responsive.
This is where the fun begins, Saavik!
Sector two... Indicating desert terrain. Minimal vegetation, temperature thirty-nine point four.
It's snow. Snow in the same sector. Fantastic!
All the varieties of land and weather known to Earth within a few hours walk!
Later. Let's go...
Captain, this is Saavik. Come in, please...
Mr. Scott, all power to the weapons systems --
My God...
We are secured from Warp Speed... Now entering Genesis Sector of Mutara Quadrant.
Uhura, any response from Starfleet on our Project Genesis inquiries?
Yes... I hear you.  I just had to try.
You're right.  Thanks for the drink.
Ambassador, I -- I had no idea you were here...  I think you know my crew...
We are cloaked. Enemy closing on impulse power. Range, 5,000 Kellicams.
My Lord... what are your orders?
Sir, may I --
We still have the prisoners, sir. Perhaps their information --
But surely, our mission has not failed -- ?
Cheers. Bones, these are... charming.
Uh -- what are they?
But I'm allergic to Retlax.
They even killed the galley chief.
I still don't under --
Does that about do it?
You're crazy -- !
I'm Admiral Kirk...
What are <u>you</u> looking at?
No sir! We have Genesis -- Whatever you want --
Goodbye, Admiral. Oh, and don't count on Enterprise. She can't move. My next act will be to blow her out of the heavens.
I'm getting a voice message... wait ... short range band. They say their Chambers coil is shorting their COMM system.
Admiral, I've got to take the mains off the line. The energizer's shaken loose and I can't get in there to fix her -- radiation --
Is the word given?
There are two possibilities, sir they are unwilling to respond, they are unable to respond.
Twelve hours and forty-three minutes, present speed.
The prefix code?
Sporadic energy readings port side, aft. Could be an impulse turn.
May I speak, sir?
I wish to thank you for the high efficiency rating.
I did not think so.
I failed to resolve the situation.
May I ask how <u>you</u> dealt with the test?
It doesn't make sense. These coordinates are well within Regula -- a plantoid we know to be lifeless and airless.
Cease fire. Look sharp.
Reliant in our section this quadrant, sir, and slowing --
Shields activated!
Lieutenant, how many times have you piloted a Starship out of Spacedock?
Professor Scott, I'm Dr. Nichols, plant manager. I'm terribly sorry but there's been an awful mix-up Would you believe I was never told about your visit?
I prefer a dose of common sense. you are proposing to head backwards in time, find Humpback Whales, then bring them forward in time, drop them off - and hope they tell this Probe what to do with itself!
That's crazy!
Most unusual. An unknown form of energy of great intelligence and power. I find it illogical that its intentions are hostile...
There are millions of other species on Earth, Doctor. Only human arrogance would assume the message was meant for man.
What's your degree in, dentistry?
Fundoscopic examination --
A simple evacuation of the expanding epidural hematoma will relieve the pressure.
No, sir. And no Federation wessels on assigned patrol stations.
They like you very much. But they are not the hell your whales.
Memory problems, too.
Iowa.
Can I ask <u>you</u> something?
What's that?
You tricked me.
Ready to engage computer, Admiral.
The late 20th Century.
Not with this equipment. I have had to program some of the variables from memory.
Availability of fuel components; Mass of the vessel through a time continuum, and the probable location of Humpbacks, in this case, the Pacific basin.
Spock...
About those colorful metaphors we discussed. I don't think you should try to use them.
Well, for one thing, you haven't quite got the hang of it.
And another thing... It is not always necessary to tell the truth.
You don't have to lie... You could exaggerate.
You've done it before. Can't you remember?
What else did you learn from your mind meld?
They have a right to be...  Do you think they'll help us?
Spock: Condition report!
10,000 M.S.L., Admiral.
I'll have bearing and distance for you, sir.
We're ready, sir. I've converted the Dilithium Sequencer to something less primitive. And Admiral -- I've replaced the Klingon Food Packs. They was givin' me sour stomach.
Admiral! There be whales here!
I'll have to re-energize.
Don't know anything about it? I find it difficult to believe that I've come millions of miles --
Chotto omachi nasarei. Namae wa nanto moosareruka na.  Wait my son. What is your name?
Ah, sorenara mazu mazu nagaiki wo sareru to mira.  Ah... Then I am sure that you will have a long and happy life.
The craftsmanship is extraordinary.
An apprentice for thirty years.  We've noticed your people's mental discipline. Did that develop here?
Will it?
A perfect moment?
Seeing my home planet from space for the first time...
I wish I could spare a few centuries to learn.
But I have three hundred and eighteen days of vacation time coming. I plan on using them.
I have to go home now.
Yes... that looks like them.
'his nose should pant and his lip should curl...'
Your Federation procedures have made this mission ten times as difficult as it needed to be...
You have no idea what precipitated his behavior?
The Enterprise can be at your position in two days, Admiral...
What kind of concerns?
The countdown control has been transferred to the collector...I can't override...
The torque sensors are out of alignment... by twelve microns... you could hear that?
I don't think they believe us.
'Yew-cheen chef-faw.'
We came here from a solar system on the verge of self- annihilation... where technology had created weapons that threatened to destroy all life. A small group of us set off to find a new home... a home that would be isolated from the threats of other worlds.  That was three hundred and nine years ago.
Sir, if we fire a tachyon burst, it may force him to reset his shield harmonics. When he does, we could beam him out...
You need a haircut, Commander.
I don't see anything to suggest the Son'a have any interest in sociology...
Wine, women and song.
All hands. Battle stations!
What are we waiting for? Let's go.
Are you saying they won't help us?
There must be some good people... even in this time.
You are the guiding intelligence behind the Borg...?
Isn't it better like this...?
Mister Data, I want to know the exact date and time.  Give me a damage report on that missile silo.
What did you do to the batteries?
Where's you get the alloy for the throttle itself?
The inertial dampers are having trouble compensating... I don't think Cochrane built this thing for comfort.
That was a pretty clever trick you did with the hospital's batteries. How'd you do it?
"Money." So you can get dome money...
Incoming transmission from the Borg.
Worf, have Doctor Crusher, Mister La Forge and a security team meet me in Transporter Room Three. Civilian clothes.
Casualties are light, Captain. Minor buckling on the port nacelle. Nothing serious.
You will have to realign the targeting array of the quantum torpedo... and reprogram the warhead for the localized detonation.  There's only one torpedo left...
I have to admit there was a moment there when --
Mr. President.
Mr. President we cannot allow Federation citizens to be abducted.
Uh, Jim...
What kind of creature is this? Last night you two were spooning -
This is fun...
They'll respect him now...
And now we come to the architect of this tragic affair, Captain James Tiberius Kirk. I put it to you, Captain, that you were seeking revenge for the death of your son.
Get close enough to a man and you can kill him on "Stun" without setting off the alarm - of course you can't get rid of the body...
Klingon blood.
This is the first evidence that corroborates our theory.
Now we expand our search to include uniforms.
Your research laboratory is most impressive...
How much time's left of your sentence?
Aye, sir.
Kronos, sir?
I'm getting underway now. But you should know, I'm in alpha Quadrant. The chances of my reaching the conference in time are slim.
According to my information, today.
We HAVEN'T fired -
Captain, perhaps we're going about this the wrong way; our job is to get to the conference; HER job will be to stop us.
Captain, we can't see her, but she gives off heat...
If you are logical.
I have confirmed the location, sir, but...
- could take weeks, sir.
Under impulse power she expends fuel like any other ship. We call it "Plasma" - I do not know the Klingon name for it, but by any name it is merely ionized gas.
I notice Dr. Crusher laughing along with the rest of you. As most of you know, the doctor will also soon be leaving the Enterprise, to assume command of Starfleet Medical. Again, I'm forced to ask, Beverly, have you considered what you're doing to little ole me?! I'll probably get some old battle-axe of a doctor who'll tell me to eat my vegetables and put me on report if I dont show up for my physical on time!
How long does he have?
He is very observant.
Can you open the shuttlebay doors?
You have a red shirt.
Why?
It's you.
Shinzon's Viceroy seems to have the ability to reach into my thoughts. I've become a liability... I request to be relieved of my duties.
Captain Picard, Commander Donatra of the Warbird Valdore. Might we be of assistance?
The Empire considers this a matter of internal security. We regret you've become involved.
What's he doing?
Enterprise. We are the Reman Warbird Scimitar.
Worf, prepare a full phaser spread, zero elevation. All banks on my mark. Scan for shield impacts and stand by photon torpedoes.
Why don't they answer our hails?
It's working.
But she's not the Enterprise.
Anything.
No one knew what to do. Finally I was taken to a doctor who had some experience with Terran illnesses and I was finally diagnosed with Shalaft's syndrome. Do you know of it, Captain?
Shinzon... I'm trying to believe you.
If there's one ideal the Federation holds most dear it's that all men, all races, can be united. From the first time the Vulcans came to Earth we've sought a future of peace. Nothing would make me more proud than to take your hand in friend- ship. In time. When trust has been earned.
That's your life... not mine.
Its too late.
Believe it or not, I think the cavalry has arrived.
What is it?!! Focus on your job!!
Benny, there's nothing there.
What do you think of America?
George, we've just confirmed the existence of the live extraterrestrial.
Well, we're in pursuit of a green Mustang...
I won't let anyone hurt you.
Steering wheel...
Mi-chi-gan driver li-see-ens... Jennyhaydn... Money?
That's a big help. Where are you from?
Are you from up there? Space?
What is...  ...Coke?
I...
I want to try it.
The closest I was able to get you was Lathrop Wells...
Yes.
Eh... yes...
No... The closest...
I'd love to have a baby. But I can't...
Goodbye.
You shouldn't drink so much of that stuff. It's bad for you.
You are cold.
It'll tell you pretty much everything about us...
Any words you don't know you can find in the dictionary.
It'll give you the different countries, how they came to be, what they are now, how America came to be, the governments, the languages... everything.
What will you say about us?
I love you.
The five-fifty. We already passed it. But it'll take him way out of his way.
Why wouldn't he want to go through the roadblock?... What did you guys do?... I won't tell anybody.
You get that, Lyman?
How would you describe the sounds we heard coming out of that thing's helmet?
Listen to this.  A woman was kidnapped in Eau Claire this morning. When a citizen went to her rescue the kidnapper threatened him with a gun and shouted at him in a strange 'clicking gibberish'...
Yeah, that's right.
Bullshit politics.
Come on, let's go, I got to get back.
I already got a real one.  Come on, it won't be too bad.  It's not personal.
Well, I'm certainly in the mood for a party.
I don't think that's a good idea, Lenny.
So finally he gives Iris some cash and tells her to check into the hotel under a wrong name till he figures out what to do.
You think Tran killed her?
See, if you packed your piece you could've made the guy see sense.
Jesus.
Only he doesn't know about me and Faith.  So I say to myself, if I turn the job down, he just gets somebody else.  And I lose Faith... to coin a phrase.  So to buy time, I do the skank.  I still gotta do something about Tran... I figure it's him or me... but I can't cap him without a chump to take the fall.  And who better than his girlfriend's loser ex-boyfriend... a known criminal... who has been seen hassling them in public numerous times.
No plan is perfect, Lenny.  Hey, cheer up.  World's gonna end in ten minutes anyway.
Show a little respect, Nero.  The man was an important artist.
I always do.
What's his name?
You're some piece of work, you know that.  Just calmly backstroking around in the big toilet bowl, and somehow you never let it touch you. I mean, between Vice and this so- called occupation you're in now, you must've seen it all.
What I'm saying.  But you still come out this goofball romantic.
Don't crank the gain any more. You're gonna fry yourself.
What is it?
Those two guys were cops.
Yeah.  Lenny.  I have.
I guess.
Hey, Lenny.  We made it.
So you're saying we just pretend is didn't happen?  It happened!  The LAPD executed one of the most important black men in America!  Who the fuck are you to bury this?!
Yeah, well maybe it's time for a war!
I hope that wasn't a joke because I can assure you, from personal experience, the FBI does not have a sense of humor.
Ligature strangulation, just like his victims. A cord, nylon, you can tell by the indentation signature -- again, like his victims.  Look at that little thing and look at all the trouble it got him in. Should have cut it off.
We had to bring staff in from the whole county to handle this.
I've been looking for you.
Deputy Director, get out, sir.
Nothing concrete. Nothing I'd... well, nothing.
I'm hesitant to...
When I was at the rest stop, there was a young boy, maybe ten, and his mother. Darryl Hawkins, Zero, abducted the boy in the men's room. I tried to stop him. He cold-cocked me --
Every cop has a story and every story has a girl. The girl in my story was fifteen years-old. She wore a pink angora sweater -- I can still see it -- one day, she disappeared. I told the police she wouldn't run away, I told them who to look for, but I was just a kid. I sat in the police station crying and crying. My parents took me home. The girl was my cousin and the man who abducted her was a teacher I'd had. He kept her alive a week before he killed her. The police could have saved her. Every time I see a photo of a victim I see her. That's what I want to do. I want to save her.
None. Can't find a thing. Nothing on file, nothing online. It's not a part of any known killer's signature.
That's because he's a fucking wacko. Never met a self-promotion scheme he didn't like. What's he doing now?
Maybe we should back off a bit.
No, I mean maybe we should back off a bit, you and me.
It's quite advanced.
All the same killer?
Suspect Zero is a crackpot theory. You said so.
You're assigned, we're assigned, to apprehend Richard Low, not Suspect Zero. I have to tell you, Mack, I'm not comfortable where you're going.
How did you know Speck was a killer?
Is he dead?
Good morning, sir. Agent Salinas, sir.
Yes, sir.
I believe it's in my file, sir.
Thomas Mackelway.
Updating the condition of all Bureau- owned vehicles in the southwest sector, sir.
I'm Agent Thomas Mackelway, FBI. There is no way you will escape. Assistant Deputy Director Richard Low is en route with another Agent.  You may know Low by another name. You may know him by the name Murman. I am Lionheart.
He's a brilliant man. Brilliant enough to catch you.
Hi.
I'm Mike.
Like the quiche?
I like quiche.
My reputation seems to have preceded me.
I'm considering taking a job as a "Goofy".
The poor thing. Six years?
Can I check my messages? I have a calling card.
How's it going? It's been a while...
How are you doing?
Good.  I think about things.
Yeah.
You know, us.
It doesn't matter. I think about you every day.
I miss you, Mike.
I couldn't. Do you know how hard it's been not to call you? I pick up the phone every night. Whenever that commercial comes on...
...Yeah, with the baby in the tire. One time I started to cry right in front of Pierre...
I'll get a Dewars rocks... 
You want to talk about it?
Pause it. 
Yeah. Here it's easier to avoid trouble. It's not like you like in Compton where bullets are whizzing by your head every day. Nobody's mugging you on no subway. In New York the trouble finds you. Out here you gotta go look for it...
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. 
Mike?
Don't call me ever again.
Wake up, baby.
That was so fuckin' money. It was like that "Jedi mind" shit.
I know. I know.
I'm just trying to be a gentleman, show some respect...
I wish the game still had fights so I could bitch-slap Wayne.
No. Doesn't that suck?
Was I money?
Why, baby? What'd I do wrong?
She didn't see.
Bitch... You little bitch!
It's on.
Baby, I know it is. It's a black diamond trail...
...but it's worth the risk. True or false: It's worth the risk.
...Sue...
...Shut up, Sue...
Anything...Anything the Godfather wishes.
The Don himself is coming to me tonight?
You fingered Sonny for the Barzini people.  That little farce you played out with my sister.  Did Barzini kid you that would fool a Corleone?
Sollozzo knows Mike's a civilian.
You think we'll go for that last place?
He's his own boss, and very competent.
Two terms; one in Italy, one in the United States.  He's known to the Government as a top narcotics man. That could be a plus for us; he could never get immunity to testify.
This morning.
I told you that it wouldn't escape his eye.
Get the car.  I'll be leaving in ten minutes.  Where's Calo?
The old man wants you; Johnny's here...he's got a problem.
We'll let the old man take it easy for a couple of weeks.  I want to get things going good before he gets better.  What's the matter with you?
No more stalemate Tom, we got the soldiers, we'll match them gun for gun if that's how they want it. They know me for what I am, Tom-- and they're scared of me.
What about McCluskey?
If he's your brother, why does he have a different name?
Visiting hour ends at eight thirty. I'll just sit with him; I want to show respect.
I don't think so.  You don't want to end up on page 3 of the Daily News.
I don't think so either.  I better go.
All right, Mikey...who do we have to hit, Clemenza or Paulie?
I'm glad you came, Mike.  I hope we can straighten everything out.  All this is terrible, it's not the way I wanted things to happen at all. It should never have happened.
Mike, good to see you.  Got everything you want?
The chef cooked for you special; the dancers will kick your tongue out and you credit is good!  Draw chips for all these people so they can play on the house.
I'll do it. I make a fabulous martini.
He's drowning me!
Bird! Ask me the name of my sailboat --
Do you have any brothers?
I'm thinking of giving up the sax, what do you think about drums?
Of course, he's been very involved in his music, hasn't he? I think his theory is, you know, you have to go into a cocoon before you can become a butterfly.
How did you find him? It's such an out of the way apartment. Can I fix you a drink?
I'm going to take Marge for a little walk, Tom. Mr MacCarron wants to talk with you.
You were right about the telephones. There are no lines, there's some problem.
Dickie!
I was looking forward to seeing him.
That's a terrific idea.
But I hope that note goes to New York in your purse, for a rainy day.
I don't know. Peter has a concert in Athens next month -- and he's asked if I want to go along, help out. He says goodbye by the way -- he's in rehearsal, otherwise --
What?
What's funny?
Will you meet me tomorrow? Just to say goodbye in the daylight, properly? So it's not just this, it's too... you should always save pain for daylight...
I don't -- is that by the Spanish Steps?
Ditto.
What did he say?
How was it?
Was that Meredith?
Meredith Logue. You were kissing somebody. Looked like Meredith.
Didn't look that way -- you know -- from a distance.
Why lie?
Or Tom and Peter even.
Really, why?  Sorry, I'm completely lost.
What do you mean lied about who you are?
What are you talking about -- you're not a nobody! That's the last thing you are.
And don't forget. I have the key.
You got a .44 Magnum?
We've signed up 15,000 Palantine volunteers in New York so far. The organizational problems are becoming just staggering.
This is sort of high class...
Well... mostly...
Well, if Cronkite's so great, why don't we run him instead?
Sure we could run him. You realize he's already head of his block association.
No, why?
What taxi driver?
How long has he been there?
She stayed in the cab, what's she gonna do? But she stiffed me. A real skunk.
20 bucks?
Well, you want to or not?
Say, aren't you Charles Palantine, the candidate?
Well, I'm one of your biggest supporters. I tell everybody that comes in this cab that they should vote for you.
I'm sure you'll win, sir. Everybody I know is going to vote for you.  I was going to put one of your stickers on my taxi but the company said it was against their policy.
Is that so?
Wiz?
Look, ah, we never talked much, you and me...
I wanted to ask you something, on account you've been around so long.
Well, I just, you know...
Real down.
Sometimes it gets so I just don't know what I'm gonna do. I get some real crazy ideas, you know? Just go out and do somethin.
Yeah.
Like do anything, you know.
Spit it out.
I.don't get it.  You're going to help me?
God's speed.
Not exactly light reading, I know. Believe it or not, I've read this since high school, and it got me all the way through law school. Besides, there's something in there that'll help you.  You won't have to get very far, it's near the beginning.
Just remember two things.  First, the law is a living thing.  It made us free and it keeps us free. Sometimes it gets twisted around by people for their own purposes. Sometimes it makes mistakes, sometimes big mistakes.  But in the end, the law prevails for the just. Sometimes, it takes a while.
What.
Me too.
I do?
What was that?
Do you have the...
What... do you remember?
I see...
Yes.  A prepared statement.
Doc, with your permission, I want to bring someone in here.  Maybe it'll jar this young man's memory.
You never came back from the war. We were told you were missing and presumed dead.
Yes?
Forty-two was a lean year around here.  The war had just started... you were gone less than a month... and we were coming off a bit of a drought as I recall.  Not everyone could ante up the price of a ticket, and a chicken's as good as money if you ask me.  At that time, it meant a lot to the folks around here to be able to come to the pictures.
Jesus...
Here, one of mine.
You smell gas?
Jesus.
Peter, I'm an agent.  I buy lunches and get deals made for guys like you.  That's what I do.  You're a writer.  You write pictures. That's what you do.  And trust me, you'll be back doing it again tomorrow morning.
Kid, you gave them what they wanted.  This committee, it feeds on names.  The more names, the better.  But for some high-profile witnesses, like yourself, any name will do.
That's my r-r-rent.
Ancestors?
Are you a friend of Mitch's?
No, thank you.  Won't you call me Melanie?
Mother!
Yeah, but she'll be hitting all that traffic going back to San Francisco.
Are you sure?
I need her exact name, you see.
Yes?
Thank you.
We don't have any fog this time of year, Mitch.
He sold the feed to me, didn't he?
Whose side are you on?
I'm not very good at this, Mitch.
Please don't mess me up with bandages, Mrs. Brenner.
He won't be back until Monday. I mean, if those birds are for him....
Yes. I don't think you should leave them in the hall, do you?
Ouch!
Didn't you see the lovebirds?
To bring your sister those birds. You said it was her birthday. Besides, I was coming up anyway.
To see a friend of mine.  Will you please be careful?
Why... 
Annie. Annie Hayworth.
Yes.
We... we went to school together. College.
Just a few... just a day or two... the weekend.
Oh, no you don't!
That might have been good enough in Rome last summer. But it's not good enough now.
But not for me.
It all started several months ago with a peasant sparrow up in the hills, a malcontent. He went around telling all the other sparrows that human beings weren't fit to rule this planet, preaching wherever anyone would listen...
Yes, of course, he had to have a beard! 'Birds of the world, unite!' he kept saying, over and over...
Not at first. Oh yes, a few sparrows out for kicks...
Sure. But eventually, even the more serious-minded birds began to listen. "Why should humans rule?" they asked themselves.
Why should we submit ourselves to their domination?
And all the while, that sparrow was getting in his little messages. Birds of the world, unite!
Where are they heading?
Santa Rosa?
There we are!
I don't know why.
Birds?
We need them.
I'm Donald Fettes.
Mr. Gray?
It's not because of Georgina -- because of Dr. MacFarlane's failure?
I'm afraid I'll have to give up medicine, Dr. MacFarlane.
I'm afraid I have to, sir.  You see, my father is vicar at Thrums -- it's a small parish -- not much of a living --
I thought only the best students were made assistants.
But Richardson?
I don't know that -- neither do you.  This subject may have been an epileptic -- thrown a fit -- fallen out of bed -- cracked her skull and killed herself -- there is everything explained -- the bruise on her head --
Where shall we put it? In the back?
You'll not need that again, Georgina.
Now that wasn't a friendly thing I heard, Toddy.  Not at all friendly.
You know what you want and don't want -- so that's an end of business between us -- but we'll still be friends, Toddy.  I'll be dropping by to see you and Meg once in a while -- for auld lang syne, you know.
Surely you are not threatening an old friend, Toddy.
I have made you give me money, but you smile. Aren't you angry?
I'm sorry, Doctor.  Georgina's a good child -- a brave child -- you saw how she was during the operation -- but if she can't move, she can't move.
She would if she could.
It was one thing her dad rejected you. But when she did you lost it.
Think maybe knives do?
You're him! You're Corvis! We fried your ass. You're dead, man!
I know who you are.  That's why you paint your face. To hide.
It's ok, it's ok...
Erin. Who?
Just don't believe everything you see.
Why are there so many?
I would never hurt you or Lauren. Never. Believe me.
Please. Come inside.
The people who came to the meeting must be made to realize this. They must understand what is at stake.  You mentioned a demonstration of force--
Would such, a demonstration be possible before the meeting?
Something that would dramatize for them and for their people the seriousness of the situation. Something that would affect the entire planet.
I wouldn't want you to harm anybody -- or destroy anything.
Maybe a little demonstration.
Bobby--! What are you doing up at this hour?
Tell me what?
Now, Bobby, just a minute--
Bobby, you've been dreaming again.
Maybe four thousand miles an hour. And outside the Earth's atmosphere a good deal faster.
We certainly did.
I'm sure you recognize from our broad- casts the evil forces that have produced the tension in our world. Surely you would agree--
I was only hoping to make you understand.
Perhaps if you could explain a little--
He's not there.  But look what I found in his room
Mr. Carpenter -- this is none of my business, but -- why did that detective come here last night?
It must be twelve-thirty.
The Professor's secretary says she found you in Barnhardt's room, making marks on his blackboard.
I don't like horror comics.
All together?
We were gonna grab some food.
Look.
He's telling the truth!  Aren't you, Michael?
Don't go out there!  Stop him!
Grandpa, the Widow Johnson called. She said to pick her up a seven instead of eight.
I guess so.  She said not to be late.
Okay?
He met a girl.
Ohmygod...
Maybe this is the night where everything finally goes right for a change.
Hi...
You've got to put this on.
Huh?
Do I have to do this?
What happened, Michael!?
What about Nonook?  What have you done to Nanook?!  What have you done to my dog, you asshole?!
What do you want from us?
Was that dog, the Norwegian dog?
... Can't you see...?  If one cell of this Thing got out it could imitate every living thing on Earth. Nothing could stop it!  Nothing!
Why didn't it imitate Fuchs?  Isn't that its number -- to get more recruits.
Somebody's taken it.  I can't find it!
Torch them!!
We should have jumped his ass.
What are you doing?
Can there be... some kind of test? To find out who's what?
We're on fire!
Oh, I got you.  Not too long.
We've got to find Fuchs.  When we find him -- we kill him.
You and Nauls got to block off the west side bunks, the mess hall and the kitchen.
You hear that?
No one ever comes here.  My mother told me stories about it late at night.  They tell all the children.
Because you'll never die.
Alexander... Listen to me, it was wrong to bring you.  You're not going to find what you're looking for.
Say I just come back again?
God -- could have killed me -- bad girl, Nell!  How did you know to do that?
Well, much obliged -- I'm always forgetting the confounded brake -- say, if you wait until I get her up and running I'll give you a perambulation.  Tell you all about her.
Next time then.  We perambulate here most every night.
Alex, what is it?
Darling.
All right...
Alex... people are staring.
I've been working.
I'm sorry, David.
Couldn't help but overhearing.  Two fine young people starting out on the road of life.  I wish you the very best.
I hope it's a happy journey for you both -- and much as I hate to do this, moved as I am by your protestations of love, I'll be needing your money now.
And your jewelry too.  I guess we could consider this your first little bump on the road to married bliss.
Oh, that explains everything.
That machine --
How long ago?
The mud carriers.
Want to be a high climber now, do you?
It's not supposed to be easy, it's supposed to be beautiful.
I don't understand.
It has no purpose.  It's just beautiful... Does everything have a purpose where you come from?
It's always been this way here.  We work on the towers all our lives. When we're young we train to be planners or climbers or sculptors...
And there's no shame to that.  It's all the same here.  Everyone has an important job to do.  We all work together and couldn't survive without each other.
I'm a planner.  I help decide where the new towers go and what they should look like.
It was different then.
With respect, sir, would we have the telegraph without fantasy? Would we have radium and X-rays without someone first dreaming we could?
My equations are not parlor-tricks!
You won't even try?
I wonder if that poor girl has any idea what she's in for?
We were forced to use restrains if that's what you're referring to.
Who are you?
[Beat] You're his son?
He died because he bled to death from a blow to his head. Someone had to have given him it.
Get your fucking hands off my daughter!
Jackie, I'm William Starks. I can prove it.
No, I don't have anything to show you. I'm here from a mental hospital.
I didn't kill Officer Harrison.
How? Did they figure it out after I died?
Of course he will. [Beat] What day of the week is it?
[Beat] You be good to yourself, Jackie.
My God you look exactly like him.
Yeah, I did. [Beat] He was my most memorable patient.
You don't understand.
Can I get some paper and something to write with.
I know you need one when it's really cold.
Mortality's actually a great thing to be familiar with. It means you're sane on some level.
[Beat] How do you know?
If you're deaf, read my lips...I don't need a psycho following me today.
I only lit it because it was so cold in here. I'm sorry if...
I'm sorry.
Did either of them ever indicate that they might be running from the Law?
I swear to God, she wouldn't tell me one thing!  Christ!  You oughta try to find that kid that was with 'em.
I'm sorry to bother you, I know you're real busy right now, but how many times, Max?  How many times has that woman gotta be fucked over? You could lift one finger and save her ass and you won't even do that?
This is J.D.  He's a student.  We're just givin' him a ride to... to here.  Louise said we could bring him here and then he'd have to go. And that's what he's doin'.  He's goin'.  Aren't you, J.D.?
Louise!  Where are you?  Are you alright?  Honey...
Now, my little coconut, what seems to be the trouble here?  Tell Daddy everything.
You wanna take it out of your wallet, please?
Alright...  I changed my mind.  I'll have a margarita with and a shot of Cuervo on the side, please.
We have to think this through.  We have to be smart.  Now is not the time to panic.  If we panic now, we're done for.  Nobody saw it. Nobody knows it was us.  We're still okay.  Now all we have to do is just figure out our next move.
If you weren't so concerned with having a good time, we wouldn't be here right now.
It means shut up, Thelma.
I wish we could've brought him with us.
Oh, Thelma.  Oh, no.
Thelma, please get a hold of yourself.  You're making a spectacle.
I'm sorry.  I am happy.  I'm very happy for you.  I'm glad you had a good time.  It's about time.  Where is he now?
Besides, what do we say about the robbery?  No excuse for that.  No such thing as justifiable robbery.
Look!  Look who it is, Thelma.  I'll be darned.  What's he doin' way out here.
Sorry!
Thelma, that is not an option.
I guess we shoulda made some kinda plan for what to do if we get caught.
Now what?
Then let's not get caught.
Go.
Hey, shit-for-brains, be careful not to scratch that thing, huh?
You heard me. You already put a fucking nick in my piano.
S'matter with you? You look like you're fading.
Heavy? Heavy?! What I wouldn't give to know what heavy feels like, you insensitive prick.
Come on, that wouldn't make me gay.
Maybe you're right. I should look on the bright side. I mean, I've still got my health...  I'm out of here. I've got to get up at six a.m. to move my boss's brother into his apartment.
Never met him.
Okay, sounds like you're all set. Just clean the pipes and it's a go.
You know, clean the pipes.
Who?
Very nice.
Oh yeah.
Don't you want to know my name?
How'd you know that?
You know, sometimes I wish I could be like Magda and not go home. I'd like to just bounce around for awhile, do a little traveling...
Urrggghh...
Mary's a little chubby, huh?
Hey, hey, hey!
You know, I really should take your card.
You little fuck.
What? Steve seemed to put up with Warren.
I'm buying bananas tonight.
Back when I was your age I always used to make myself a big banana split after sex. I think you're gonna need one tonight.
You don't think they're too big?
Uh, well... not exactly. You see, I exaggerated a little there.
You asshole, what are you --  Mary! Is that you?
Now by killer, you mean...?
Jeez, Mary... I'm...
Ted... you're not that far ahead.
Why not?
But but what about Steve?
Charlie, that's mean. Come on in, Ted. Don't listen to Mr. Wise Guy here. He's a joke a minute.
Piggyback ride.
I believe the President made it clear that there would be no firing on ships without his express permission.
This was not the President's intention when he gave that order. What if the Soviets don't see the distention? What if they make the same mistake I just did?  There will be no firing anything near ANY Soviet ships without my express permission, is that understood, Admiral?
Goddamn Stevenson. Jesus. Peace at any price. You'd think nobody learned anything from World War Two.
We have to pull him. He's not going to be able to handle the Soviets in front of the U.N. Zorin will eat him alive.
Jesus...
Slow down. Smell that?
I am instructed to tell you that the American Government would respond favorably to an offer along the lines you have discussed. If this solution were raised at the U.N. by Ambassador Zorin, he would find a favorable reply from Ambassador Stevenson.
That is correct.
Yes. From the Highest Authority. There are two conditions. The U.N. must be allowed to inspect the removal of the missiles.
Then we have no choice.  General, issue the warning orders to our forces. They will be prepared to execute the air strikes Monday morning and the follow-on invasion according to the schedule thereafter. I'll need the official release orders on my desk Sunday night.
There are major rail disruptions in the South, two airborne divisions are on alert. That exercise is an invasion.
Okay. Kenny and I only show for the meetings you call us into. Impress us. And do it fast.  You're in charge of keeping this quiet. If word gets out before we know what we're going to do, there'll be panic. And it'll ruin any chance of surprise if we decide to hit them.
That's going to be tough. You know how these guys are about their chains of command...
You must think I'm blind and stupid. I've already gotten the birds and bees from Bobby. The President doesn't have to double-barrel me.
-- you sonofabitch, goddamn it, I didn't drop --
Yeah.
Heroes ain't supposed to shake. I'm shakin', man, look at me.
What's this about?
You think I killed him? Cuz he was an apple? Well, let me tell you something about Leo, Man --
Somebody must be doing something somewhere in your jurisdiction, Officer Crow Foot.
This is a restricted area.
Who is he?
Genetic ditto on evidence found at the site with evidence you found in his belongings. An incontrovertible motive. And definite footprints on Jimmy Looks Twice at Maisy Blue Legs house.
Today. And now you -- there's a dog in the van --
You weren't sent here to go off on your own detail, Ray. You were sent here to assist in a Selective Operations Unit. These regional agents are inept -- that's why they were sent out here to The Graveyard, to Indian Country. I need you behind me, Ray. Not pulling against me.
Your first homicide, that's gonna happen, Ray...
This was a Selective Operations Unit, Agent Levoi. There is classified information pertaining to our national security. You don't question that, you don't go digging into that shit -- that's insubordination. Jesus Christ --
We were sworn in on the Constitution to protect federal matters, Ray. I don't know about uranium, I don't know about Red Dog Table -- all I know is we did our job. It's over.
Grandpa Samuel Reaches. Heavy duty medicine.
Don't be mad. That was just an old traditional gesture that means hello, how are you.
Agent Little Weasel, Federal Bura of your Imagination.
You're right about the old man. His power's long dried up. He's supposed to be a medicine man but he won't go see the people. He says we changed, and we don't listen. Well, he don't go out and talk no more. I haven't had a drink in three years but I just turned my sobriety chip into that man behind the bar, and this Hoss is gettin' watered.
Cuz I'm a skin?
Not no more.
You tell me. You tell me who went to the B.I.A. -- Bureau of Indian Annihilation and said I was messin' with your case, man. I don't give a goddamn about your case.
Jesus. Oil?
1868...
That's what we're doing here. National interest. National security. Only this time it's not gold. It's uranium.
Leo knew about it. Tried to tell Jimmy, get the Warriors involved.
I'll have to see what the visions say about that one.
X21, give me a 20.
What ya want?
Since I got a iron pipe put across my knees, man. Fight with three wasi'cus, ya know.
No, that was Leavenworth. This --  was Sioux Falls. What ya want?
It isn't?
That's a big comfort to me.
How so?
Two.
No!
You're horrible
You don't have to kill it.
You ever think about killing another human being?
Lucky charm.
Just good luck.
What does it mean?
Lieutenant... Is there... a Russian attack?
Hey, if it was easy, everybody would want to come up here and do it..... Instead of just us.
THERE'S ANOTHER ONE UP THERE!
You hear that? Anything we want. Anything...Well???
What do you want?
What do you want?
How was it?
We did it!
What what are you doing? We're cover!
Well, he's going  and he needs someone to fly the plane.
COME OFF RIGHT--COME OFF HIGH--I'M IN--I'LL ENGAGE.
The hard deck for this hop was ten thousand feet. Jester, at what point did you call off the fight?
You didn't help.
I wasn't thinking. I just did it.
How can I go on? I feel so... responsible.
You think I shouldn't fly.
Would you take me back? Would they?
What happened to number five?
There you go, Mr. Brubaker.  Suite 610 in the East Wing.
Richter, do you know why I'm such a happy person?
Oh shit....Oh shit...
Amazing.  Where are we?
Hey, hey Tony.  Give the big guy a break.
Harry, what the hell is this?
What the fuck did I do wrong?!  Tell me!
I've got a lock!  There!
Let me go!
Harry from work...He was the boss.
I don't know!  It had something to do with Mars.
I know it sounds crazy, but I went to this Rekall place after work, and...
Let me finish!
--I got a trip to Mars.
Forget Rekall, will you!  These men were going to kill me...
Now help me out here, Doug.  You were interested in a memory of...
Right.  Mars.
To be perfectly honest with you, Doug, if outer space is your thing, I think you'd be much happier  with one of our Saturn cruises.Everybody raves about 'em.
...What?
By the way...ever heard of a company names Rekall?
The whole core of Mars is ice.  The reactor melts it and releases oxygen.
Yeah, still got one poking around.
What the hell you doing back already?
Well, at least the bastard can't climb.  Pardon my French.
Where the hell are they?  Hope they didn't wise up.
Tammy Lynn Baxter.
Well, I'm a victim of circumstance.
Jeez, look at that guy.
It must've grabbed us.  That's why the truck stalled-out.
Hey, Rhonda, you ever heard of <u>any</u>thing like this before?
Well, folks, what's the plan?
<u>I'm</u> making the run to the Cat.
Get real.  I'm faster than you.
Road's in!
<u>People</u>?  Hell, <u>National</u> <u>Geographic</u>.
Yeah...but no ties.
We're here, Val.  Just tell us what you need.  Come back.
I've got a plan.  You and Val take your truck, get to the mountains. Hike to Bixby.  Get us some help.
What?!!  Since when the hell's every goddamn thing up to us?!
...Where're we goin'?
I don' need a hospital... I feel fine.
Your Honor, that's not fair -- !
Clyde, you wait here.  Glenn, got a minute?
We have a full caseload, Rog.
I don't venerate drug dealers, Roger. To the contrary.
...through use of informants, eavesdropping, unreasonable search and seizure...!
When did you start working for the goddam D.A.?
Goddam it... the little punk bests me again, I get thrown down and lectured at and where the hell were you?
-- What?
You're the police expert in Chinatown gangs?
Do you speak Cantonese, Mandarin, or both?
I've phoned every art supply retailer and wholesaler in the Tri-state area. No one's heard of Chuckie Roeder.
An Aryan Warrior with black teardrops painted on his face.
I did two tours in 'Nam...
But now you've strayed from your area of expertise -- dope -- into street assassins. A subject on which you're dangerously ignorant.
Did you do any hands-on work or did you just supervise, from on high?
What do you want?
You're a l-lawyer?  I... I haven't had my meds, or m-my vital signs t-taken yet. I...
I'm nearly out.
Thank you, Bobby. A big score?
What the hell is that thing doing out there? You're not taking that body anywhere.
Maybe not a thing, but maybe two things.
We got a phone, here, that's got a little ring.
Okay, that's it. I've had enough of the waiting room now.
HE'S GONE.
Came looking for a job with a friend of hers. Pretty girl. Could've been her sister.
There was only one job. Teresa took the job. Her friend took a hike. Never saw her again.
No.
There appears to be a contusion under the ring finger of her left hand.
My guess is there isn't enough detail in the photo to get an idea of the design on the ring, but we should do a blowup of this anyway.
Maybe I better start our homework.
Call me.
What are you doing?
The diary was hidden too well. He's the only one who could know where it was. He's getting to know me, now. He's real. He speaks to me.
He wants to be me... or he will kill me.
Where were you last night? We were supposed to get together. You didn't show up.
We were supposed to be together.
You're on somethin' again, aren't you?
Laura.
Let me see.
Leland...
Laura just took off. She asked me to do the run today. Should I do it?
You're right. There's no one here.
...he wants to testify...?
You know what that would mean?
Objection!
Thank you. When Debby...
I have some errands to run, and then I thought we'd spend the evening...
I'm going to take you to the home to see the girl...
Yes. Yes. I think so. I hope you'll be comfortable. I'm putting you up at my...
...apartment.  No, no. Please. You don't know who we're dealing with, I, please believe me, they...
These people play very rough. They don't want to lose this case. There's a lot of pressure they can bring to bear, I...
Dr. Gruber...
I've been meaning to come in a long time.
Uh-huh. My nephew's going to be staying with us in a few months, so I stopped by.
Is the Plaintiff ready?
Jimmy!  That's why the court exists. The court doesn't exist to give them justice, eh? But to give them a chance at justice.
They might. Yes. That's the point... is that they might... you see, the jury wants to believe. They're all cynics, sure, because they want to believe. I have to go in there tomorrow to find twelve people to hear this case. I'm going to see a hundred people and pick twelve. And every one of them it's written on their face, 'This is a sham. There is no justice...' but in their heart they're saying, 'Maybe... maybe...'
Maybe I can do something right.
Continental Casualty...
Business hours are over, Sir. This is the switch...
I'm sorry, Sir, we're not allowed...
I can't guarantee that...
Dr. Gruber.
I had an appointment at his office, I think I must have got it wrong. We had a meeting...
Who have we got?
You got the admittance form says patient ate nine hours prior to admittance.
Forget it. You can't prove it. Sister's testimony is no good. Jury knows we win she gets the cash.
...Gruber's not bad.
No.
Right.
Right.
You got a good memory, Franky.
Are you with me... are you awake...?
Rooney's protecting someone. Who is she protecting?
She's protecting the Doctors she'd be up there on the stand...
I spoke to her, and everything is all right.
She told me.
I just saw her.
What?
Mister Secretary - if they link up with those others near Fresno...
Well, you certainly don't look like yourself in that get-up!  But I am happy to meet you anyway. I'm Sylvia Van Buren.  I teach Library Science over at USC.
I might have recognized you without the beard.  And you didn't wear glasses on the 'Time' cover!
A big family must be fun...I imagine it makes you feel you belong to something.
We'll get safely out of here, don't worry.
I probably wouldn't be able to get to them if I tried...
There's one - there's the other, and we're right between them!
I warned you Civil Defense people to be ready if you have to evacuate.
Let's go back inside, Uncle Matthew.
Sweetie, you've got lots of fans, we've done market studies.  You rate right up there.  We've already got Chase working on a prototype for the glove.
I know.  We asked him to keep it kind of surprise until we talked.  Look, how about we get in touch your agent.  You still with Jerry?
Heather?
Doctor...
"...as soon as the sun was up the witch made Gretel fetch the wood and kindle a fire.  'We will bake cookies first,' she said.  'I have heated the oven and kneaded the dough.  Crawl in and see if the fire is blazing high enough now.' And she pushed Gretel toward the oven. The witch meant to shut the door and bake her once she was inside."  Dylan, this is too violent.  I don't know why you like these stupid old tales.
This is going to give you nightmares.
In my bed.
What...what is that?
I've never mentioned it to him.
Yeah, Julie, I'm sorry.  I just thought...there was an earthquake, I think.  Little one, but...
If Freddy's loose, I mean, in your script, where's he going to go?  Another age?  Another form?
Then what is he doing?
Looks like weather.
Everyone aboard young Bill?
There's still a way.
I walked in on my parents one time. It was only like eight o'clock and they were in bed and I thought that was kinda weird so I just walked in.
It's a ninety-one!  It's an 'A'!
You know?  Then why are you up here looking like you're about to jump overboard?!
Why'd you do it?
You only hurt yourself you know?
Jesus.
Who told you that?
It works?
Uh, huh.
Stow away?
Well, we thought we'd drop in and see if you were all still in one piece.
I guess we know what the next acquisition for the galley is going to be...
Don't ever call me stupid.
Much have I traveled in realms of gold/ And many goodly states and kingdoms seen/ Round many western islands have I been/ Which bards in fealty to Apollo hold/ Oft of one wide expanse had I been told/ That deep-browed Homer ruled as his demesne.
You gotta be kidding?  He's a human chum line!
Suicidal...
Are you hating this?!  Are you!
If this young man had responded instantly to your command, do you believe the ship might have been spared?
Hey... You gotta smell in this room of puke... You been pukin' in here, little girl? Huh?... You sick?... Pregnant?
You know, I really do like a woman with tits like yours that talks tough and acts like she can fuck like a bunny... Can you fuck like that?... You like it like a bunny?... Huh?... Cause baby, I'll fuck you like a real good like a big ol' jack-rabbit bunny... Jump all around in that hole... Bobby Peru doesn't come up for air.
Couple grand or more'd give you two a leg up. Get you to the west coast, Mexico, most anyplace, with a few dollars in your jeans. I got it figured good, Sailor.
Talked to her this afternoon... While you was out.
Just took a guess is all... You in or out on this deal?
Don't think about it too long.  You had enough?
Mostly black though in that boogie place.
Club Zanzibar.
About. Where Lafitte crosses over Galvez Highway. State Road 86.
That is my permiso.
In what capacity?
I'll hire a hit man if you don't want to help me stop this thing. I'll call Marcello Santos.
You're just jealous of Santos cause he's sweet on me.
Oh, Johnnie Farragut... Don't you trust your very own Marietta?
Well stop worryin' about me and start worryin' about how you're gonna get that Lula back here and away from that murderer.
Damn it, child! Now look what you made me do.
Sailor, you are somethin' else, honey... When I was fifteen, Mama told me that pretty soon I'd be startin' to think about sex, and I should talk to her before I did anything about it.
That's true. Uncle Pooch wasn't really an uncle. He was a business partner of my daddy's? And my mama never knew nothin' about me and him - that's for damn sure. His real name was somethin' kind of European, like Pucinski. But everyone just called him Pooch. He came around the house sometimes when Daddy was away. I always figured he was sweet on mama, so when he cornered me one afternoon, I was surprised more'n a little.
I'm sorry, sweetie. I forget some moments where all you been the last two years.
Don't the reject guys get anythin'?
That don't seem fair.
...That's an awful long way to go, just to get some pussy.
M-i-ss-i-ss-i-pp-i... You can almost hear that jazz blowin' up from the big N.O.
The water was rollin' off me. And I was dirty, too, like I hadn't had no bath in a long time, so the sweat was black almost.
I know. I kept walkin', I headed for your house, only it wasn't your house, really. You let me in only you weren't real pleased to see me. You kept askin', 'Why'd you come to see me now? Why now?' Like it'd been a long time since we'd seen each other.
What's wrong, sweetheart? Somethin' botherin' you?
More'n likely.
I ain't so sure it's a great idea, but that's up to you. Just don't tell her where we are.
Let's get ahold a' her quick.
Anything I can do for you?
You hungry? Pace and I ain't had dinner yet.
I'm goin', mama. No way I can't go.
Course I am, mama.
Six.
Figure we'll go have supper someplace. Maybe get some barbecue out by Stateline. Sailor always liked that Havana Brown's Pig Pickin'.
Sailor ain't a boy no more, mama.
Really, mama, I gotta go.
Wouldn't make any difference.
...Sailor Ripley... Can I talk to Lula?
What?...
You all right, Professor Tripp?
Oh, well, that's just it. She's been coming down here, every half hour or so, to, sort of, check on me. If I'm not here, she might... call the police or... something.
He said something about being between things.
What's this guy's problem?
Jesus. There must be two dozen windows on that thing. How are we supposed to find his?
Let me get this straight. Jerry Nathan owes you money. So, as collateral, he gives you his car.
So whose car is it?
The hood jumper?
Such as.
Uh huh. So. We find Vernon, we find the car. We find the car...
There's only one problem, Tripp. We don't know his real name. We just made it up. In fact, we made the whole guy up.
You driving this car?
This 1966 maroon Ford Galaxie 500. You driving this car?
Bullshit. It's mine, motherfucker.
Boy or girl?
Listen, James, about this afternoon. In workshop. I'm sorry. I think I let things get a bit out of control.
Well...
Really? That's remarkable.
Shit, James. You shot Dr. Gaskell's dog.
Couldn't you've just pulled him off me?
Thank you.
Isn't this...?
Someone jumped on your car with their butt...
That's why they all give you such a hard time in workshop.
Because you act like a goddamn spook all the time. Not to mention the fact that every last one of them is jealous of you.
I remember that. Five or six years ago.
Near Carvel?
James. This is my editor, Terry Crabtree.
The aunt, Hannah. Where did you take James that day?
But where? I need the street.
I'm sure.
Pow.
Someone stole my car.
Honestly. Someone stole my car. I parked it right there last night.
The more the merrier.
Walter?
Do you get high, Sam?
One other thing. About this kid, this student of yours -- Leer -- James Leer. You wouldn't know how I could get in touch with him, would you?
Hey, is that a school?
Fucking Mariners.
What party?
There's little chicks!  You want to see?
Hiya, Walter.
You walked home.
Sergeant Lucas.  May I come in?
What's her name?
Tell Ms. Kramer what your daddy does.
You don't like coming here, do you?
But you don't like coming here. Be honest, Walter.
Good. That's an honest answer. And why don't you like coming here?
Is it just my cheery personality that makes your skin itch?
Maybe it's the way I look. Or the sound of my name.
Because if you did, I know a therapist named Ryan. I also know a therapist named Chung.
When I say the word "girl" what is the earliest image that you can remember?
No. When I say the word "pretty," when I say the word "pleasure," what is the earliest memory you see?
It's going to take time, Walter.
How do you feel about that?
You plan to drink both those beers?
Tell me about it.
How about in the morning.
I thought I'd stay the night.
Why don't you just go now, okay?
You should be shocked. Or do you get off on this shit?
Get your kicks somewhere else.
Depraved? My mistake.
Maybe this isn't a good idea.
Don't do that.
Sneak up behind me like that.
She-hit.
Deep and slow, big guy.  Deep and slow.  Just breathe easy.
I'm taking you back out.
No, I think you were.  Come on, admit it.
Come on, you guys... look, this is the little one right here.  You can see how it's kind of zigging around.
Okay, I'm gonna free-swim to hatch six... get inside, get the door open from the other side.
Son of a bitch!
Hello, Brigman.
That's Perry.
Do we just leave him there?
Howdy, y'all.  Hey, Lindsey!  I'll be damned! You shouldn't be down here sweet thing, ya'll might run ya stockings.
That thing was probably their version of Big Geek... like an ROV.
You've got some huevos bringing this... thing... into my rig!  With everything that's been going on up in the world, you bring a nuclear weapon in here?  Does this strike anyone as particularly psychotic, or is it just me?
You're right... I don't.  I just need to know that this thing is out of here!  You hear me, Roger Ramjet?
Uh, oh...
He can still make it.
You know, I could just as well go without seeing him today.
It's already two hours... What are we going to do?
Don't be so humble.
I think that you might go and have a look yourself.
Good. It's better if it were absurd. That would mean nothing much can be done about it.
Sandro, wait a moment, just one moment... You seem like an entirely different person ...
What amazes me, is Sandro. He seems so calm.
Now, listen. For God's sake, try not to let yourself become obsessed with that idea. Go to your room and get back into bed.
You should never wish to get melodramatic over anything.
Looks like the weather is changing.
Up until now those smugglers were operating only around the Palermo area. This will be a nice surprise for the Lieutenant in Milazzo... Call up headquarters. Bring them up to date and have them give you instructions on what to do with this crate.
I wonder where they could have unloaded the stuff ... Maybe right here at Lisca.
But for what reason would she have wanted to go away?
It's strange how anxious women are to display themselves. It's almost a natural inclination.
Why don't you try?
Then you should also be able to tell me where a young girl might stay in Noto; are there any hotels or rooming houses?
Thank you.
Why have we stopped?
Agnes, it has come to my attention that you have stopped eating. Why is this? AGNES  I've been commanded by God.
No.
Yes.
I can't say.
She'd punish me.
No.
First thing that comes to your mind?
Second thing that comes to your mind.
Have you ever loved anyone?
Who?
Well, who in particular?
Uh huh.
Agnes, have you ever loved another man... other than, Jesus Christ?
Who?
Well do you love... do you love Father Martineau?
Do you think he loves you?
He's told you?
You've been alone together?
Often?
And you like that?
Where do you meet?
How would that person get one if they didn't want one?
Agnes, how did your mother get you?
Is that what she said?
Agnes, I don't believe you know nothing about sex...
... that you don't remember getting pregnant...
... and that you don't believe you carried a child.
What the child?
My bed.
A crucifix.
A wastepaper basket.
No.
For me to get sick in.
Yes.
I feel as if I've eaten glass.
God!  It was God.  And now I'll burn in hell because I hate him.
Thanks. 
And you had a sister who died in the convent.
Do you still go to church?
Oh, we just wonder if you can be very objective about this case.
But what you believe makes no difference to us whatsoever Doctor. But it does make all the difference to Agnes.
You hate us don't you?
Nuns... you hate nuns.
The Catholic Church...
Catholicism is not on trial here. I want you to deal with Agnes without any religious prejudice or you turn this case over to someone else...
Like keeping her home from school?
Listening to angels?
Do you know what she did to her?
She molested her!
There is more here than meets the eye isn't there?  Lots of dirty little secrets.
Why didn't you?  You knew she was keeping her home from school. You knew she was an alcoholic.
Why didn't you do anything to stop her?
May I be present?
Lay them down.
Lay them down.
All right, all right. If you don't need this lot, I'll lock 'em up in the dressing room till you do.
He doesn't like me, honest, I can tell ... It's 'cos I'm little.
Gerron.
Well ... come on.
No, I didn't you did ...
Ah.
And we're looking after him, are we?
Anything to spare?
Eh, he's a nice old man, isn't he?
Behave...
Oh, it's got round that you're a heavy punter.
Hi Norm!
Well, look after him. I don't want to find you've lost him.
Oh dear, I feel like doing a bit of work.
... as they head up for the show. Oh yes, well I mean it'ud be a pity to miss the show, wouldn't it like.
What is he?
Oh, a little savage, is he?
Dell, what's the last thing you can remember?
Do you remember the pyramid?
Close enough to walk to!
Dell, you want to come down, we can figure out where to go from here.
Computer, what language was that?
Sorry to interrupt, but I'm gonna charge up the engines for a minute, okay?
What the hell's going on?
Hurt!  How?
Hey, guess what?
All right... but do <u>not</u> go below decks.
It's over, Hunter.
Don't worry, it won't damage it, it'll just give it a little incentive.
The ship's gravitational attraction must have drawn him back.
I keep my mouth pretty much shut, but I don't like hitting.
... And Broussard got caught in their reproductive cycle.
I've got it.  It's coming from ascension 6 minutes 32 seconds, declination -39 degrees 2 seconds.
What'd he say?
That sounds a little fanciful...
Men have waited centuries to contact another form of intelligent life in the universe.  This is an opportunity which may never come again.
This is Chaz speaking.  Sorry, but we are not home.  Our present location seems to be only halfway to Irth. Remain at your posts and stand by. That is all.
Let's hear it.
Find anything we missed?
Still worried?
I'm sorry to say it looks like you were right in the first place, Martin.  We never should have landed here.
I can't lean on Faust any harder -- he's been working non-stop on the engines.
What's it doing, having a seizure?
Now what?
That next thing there -- six legs, tentacles -- that's the thing we saw in the food locker.
<u>Hey watch it</u>!
Me either.  I tell you, I used to be with a mining outfit on Callisto, and when something like that hits... believe me, you know about it.
A pair of incomings.  They popped-up on the medium-range about thirteen twenty-four local time.
MarsCo went belly-up on the Dow Jones.
Oh, man...
Whoa, wait a minute...
Wait.  Lost it.
Yeah, I stripped down a motion tracker and hardwired it through to the helmet pick-ups, too.  That's also on the display.
Everything on this module is locked and sealed.  We've lost 'B', 'C', and 'E' wings, but 'E' was the only one we didn't manage to totally evacuate.
Hey, boss.  Wondered where you'd gotten to.
Think I spoke too soon...
How's it going?
I don't think that's funny.
I confide in you and rely on you more than anyone I've ever known! To say a thing like that now - without any reason - when I need you more than ever...
I see. And when was this unholy alliance joined?
Was the setting properly romantic - the lights on dimmers, gypsy violins off stage?
You sat and talked until it was light...
There never was, there'll never be another like you.
I won't play tonight.  I couldn't. Not possibly. I couldn't go on...
Tell me this. Do they have auditions for television?
You mustn't worry about your little charge. She is in safe hands.
Macbeth.
Take care of yourself out there...
Bill...
Don't get stuck on some glamour puss-
You're not such a bargain, you know, conceited and thoughtless and messy-
- you're a setup for some gorgeous wide-eyed young babe.
I don't want to be childish, I'd settle for just a few years-
Am I going to lose you, Bill? Am I?
Looks like I'm going to have a very fancy party...
When I'm guest of honor?
I ran into Eve on my way upstairs; she told me you were dressing.
Well, we started talking, she wanted to know all about Hollywood, she seemed so interested...
It's a pretty rare quality these days.
So she seems.
It's obvious you're not a woman.
Well, I am.
Don't be condescending.
I admit I may have seen better days, but I am still not to be had for the price of a cocktail - like a salted peanut.
The terms are too high. Unconditional surrender.
It's not nonsense.
I wish it were.
I wouldn't want you to marry me just to prove something.
I - I don't know, Bill. Just a feeling, I don't know...
Often enough to keep the franchise.
Don't run away, Bill.
You're always after truth - on the stage. What about off?
Then face it. I have. Since that first night - here - in the dressing room.
When you told me that whatever I became, it would be because of you-
- and for you.
You think?
You hear all kinds of things.
Find out.
There are some human experiences, Birdie, that do not take place in a vaudeville house - and that even a fifth-rate vaudevillian should understand and respect!  I want to apologize for Birdie's-
Please don't have me arrested, please! I didn't steal anything - you can search me!
I hid outside in the hall till the maid came to turn down your bed. She must've forgot something and when she went to get it, she left the door open. I sneaked in and hid till she finished. Then I just looked around - and pretty soon I was afraid somebody'd notice the lights were on so I turned them off - and then I guess, I fell asleep.
That's all.
You probably won't believe me.
It was for my report.
About how you live, what kind of clothes you wear - what kind of perfume and books - things like that. You know the Eve Harrington clubs - that they've got in most of the girls' high schools?
Ours was one of the first. Erasmus Hall. I'm the president.
Hello, Miss Channing.
You mustn't mind Margo too much, even if I do...
The reason is Margo and don't try to figure it out. Einstein couldn't.
Eve. I'm fond of Margo too. But I know Margo. And every now and then there is nothing I want to do so much as to kick her right square in the pants.
I think I know...
You want to play "Cora." You want me to tell Lloyd I think you should play it.
After all you've said... don't you know the part was written for Margo?
You talk just as Addison said you did.
It's been a real pleasure, Eve.
While you're cleaning up, I'll take this to the wardrobe mistress-
It's the tight girdle that does it.
Do you want it on?
I remember.
But it can't be! We can't be out of gas! I filled it myself yesterday!  Wasn't it full when you drove to Brewster this morning?
Three days, that's for the bourgeois - I see a midnight elopement, waking up a village person...
How about calling it a night?
I shall never understand the weird process by which a body with a voice suddenly fancies itself a mind! Just when exactly does an actress decide they're her words she's saying and her thoughts she's expressing?
"Liebestraum."
Play it again.
Then this will be five. I suppose you think I'm too drunk to count.
"Liebestraum."
What is it about my writing that's so rotten?
Goddamnit--
--I'm trying--
---fifteen or more phone calls from the burglars in Miami to Gordon Liddy at CREEP--
Christ, and I even know somebody at the phone company--
I  couldn't believe what she told me. Eight cups of coffee worth.
--we've got to find out who the five guys are--the five with access to the slush fund--they were aware of the break-in.
It goes very high--we've got to find out where--
--she was really paranoid, the bookkeeper.
What would you have done?
You overslept?
Mr. Dardis does call in every so often?
--you got more than one source?--
Hannah, I never would have bothered you but I'm off to Miami and they're gonna take away my ten speed unless I get it straightened out fast.
Oh, they're here.  I'm keeping much better records now, Hannah.  See? 
It's awfully hot--  --and you haven't finished telling me about the money--
Gordon Liddy, you mean?
--that leaves Haldeman, period.
I was told by this guy at the White House that Hunt was investigating Teddy Kennedy.
Mr. Rafferty was very helpful. Four Cuban-Americans and this other man, James McCord.
I hope you noticed how coolly I behaved under the threat of discovery.
They know, but they focused on the burglary--if it didn't deal with the break-in, they didn't pursue it.
Someone with authority I'd imagine, wouldn't you?  Don't you know what you're onto? Come on.
Of course--my God, you think something this big just happens? The break-in and the cover up, of course Mitchell knew, but no more than Ehrlichman.
--correction--when you were drinking your lunch at the bar of the Sans Souci--
Ask him what he's really saying--he means take the story away from Woodstein and give it to his people at the National Desk--
--absolutely--and that's all they do, sit sit sit--every once in a while, they call up a Senator, some reporting--
Anything?
--in other words, you got nothing, you're thumbsucking.
--which Young?
--look, when the Watergate grand jury questioned you, did you name names?
Alright, well...you've got to tone it down.  You don't need to go to Lookout Point and spout cheeseball lines to be romantic.
You have to pay attention to a girl. Be sensitive to her feelings. Relationships are reciprocal.
This is your plan, Finch?
Yeah...so like, what else <u>do</u> you do?
I just -- realized that I didn't know anything about you.  I was interested.
So we're gonna be close next year?
Jessica, can you drive me home?
There's our man.
I have no idea.  Finch showers in a bathing suit.
Yeah?  Well come prom night, those excuses aren't going to do you much good.
Dad!  I know!
Yes dad.
Thank you, dad, I got it.
So, the end of the story is...you had to kiss the guy for twenty seconds?
Okay, I get it.
Feels like warm apple pie, dude.
You did it.
No, no, you must put your whole body into it.
"Dear Ms. Hughes.  We're sorry, but after keeping you on the wait list for the past couple months, we've decided you are now rejected.  Enclosed is a 100-page, full-color brochure on how rejected you are."
Like how?
I think you're so right, Kevin.
So, do you want to be -- I mean, how do you want to do it?
Like, normal style.  The...missionary position.
Hey.  I got another question for you.
So, I'm thinking prom is basically our last big chance.
Yeah, but we'll still see each other.
God, I can't believe there are so many cool people at this party.
Tell you what, we'll jump together.
Face it boyfriend. This is really happening.
Professor Claude Rousel. The one your uncle was working with. He teaches cultural history.
Come on Serafine. Let's go out. Show me the real Paris, the part that isn't overpriced and overrun with German tourists.
I'm not alright. We both know that. The only reason I'm here now is to warn you. You're still in danger. Gaston told me that Claude has got the curse too. He's a werewolf.
Holy mother of God...
What does it say?
It's you. You should be dead in that wreck with Bazin and Racine!
Another step and he's dead!
It's horrible. Terrence was one of the most brilliant men I've known.
It killed him... You coulda just used Draino. It's cheaper.
Jesus...
Not too well. He taught at the Sorbonne, right? Dad always calls him his "hippie brother". Did some work with Timothy Leary I think, and - Is he... is he going to die?
Legume? You mean, a vegetable?
What do you mean, maniacs?
Enough. Cut him loose.
You better follow that McDermott kid. He's going to wind up like his uncle if he's not careful.
Who did you hear it from?
Fortunately, I am to be married.  With your highness, permission.
Just what do you think you're doing?!
Oh! I'm sorry...
... and that Christmas dinner, when Cook made that awful plum pudding and we hid it in our pockets so we wouldn't hurt her feelings! I do remember so much now, Grandmama, - but not everything.
Trust me, it's her!
It's her.
We did it! We did it, my boy! We're going to see Tatiana at the ballet tonight and we're going to be rich! Rich!
I sent for you because I owe you a debt of gratitude larger than I can ever repay
Hey!
Allison.
I missed my therapy. I overslept.
The alarm clock.
I know- because of our sexual problem, right?
Great! Great!  Goddammit!  Ooooh! These are... p-p-p-pick this lobster up. Hold it, please!
It'll make great- Alvy, be- Alvy, it'll be wonderful... Ooooh, lovely!
For yuh.
God bless.
Oh, thank you.
So, did you do shoot the photographs in there or what?
Look at these guys.
Oh, that's hilarious. They're back from Fire Island. They're... they're sort of giving it a chance-you know what I mean?
Yeah, he's the Mafia. Linen Supply Business or Cement and Contract, you know what I mean?
No, I'm serious.  I just got my mustache wet.
Really?
I don't know, but you seem sort of distant.
Adult education is such junk! The professors are so phony. How can you do it?
David! David! I can't believe this!
I'm following you and David, if you-
Alvy, let's never break up again. I don't wanna be apart.
Living together hasn't been so bad, has it?
You know I think that if you let me, maybe I could help you have more fun, you know? I mean, I know it's hard and... Yeah.
Alvy, what about... what if we go away this weekend, and we could-
Okay, okay. Okay.
Hardly ever. Maybe three times a week.
She would not sleep with me the other night, you know, it's-
I mean... I tried everything, you know, I-I-I put on soft music and my- my red light bulb, and...
The incredible thing about it is, I'm paying for her analysis and she's making progress and I'm getting screwed.
You know... it's getting expensive my analyst... for her analyst. She- she's making progress and I'm not making any progress. Her progress is defeating my progress.
I'm into garbage. It's my thing.
Alvy.
This is my room.
Jesus, last night it was some guy honking his car horn. I mean, the city can't close down. You know, what-whatta yuh gonna do, h-have 'em shut down the airport, too? No more flights so we can have sex?
Well, I can't li- We can't have this discussion all the time. The country makes me nervous. There's... You got crickets and it-it's quiet... there's no place to walk after dinner, and... uh, there's the screens with the dead moths behind them, and... uh, yuh got the-the Manson family possibly, yuh got Dick and Terry-
Oh.
Max, my serve is gonna send yuh to the showers-
Max, the city is terribly worried.
No, no, no, Max, that's a very convenient out. Every time some group disagrees with you it's because of anti-Semitism.
Max, if we lived in California, we could play outdoors every day, in the sun.
You like this house, Max?
I even brought a road map to get us to the bathroom.
Let 'im drop dead! Who needs his business?!
Now, don't let it be so long, now.
Oh, and there's another thing about New York. See... you-you wanna see a movie, you have to stand in a long line.
It could be freezing, it could be raining.
Isn't Skye amazing?
She's a constant surprise.
Yeah, I know... But she's only twenty seven and...  The wisdom.  She's an old soul.  She knew that Shostakovich thing.  Did you notice?
Yeah, God she really does have great tits, great tits.  i can't wait to work with her.
It sounds hysterical, but Otis just rubbed up against me and I'd kind of like to change into something of yours.  You know it could be disaster.  He's so allergic.  It's terrifying.
I'll change back before we leave.
I'm fine.  I'm fine.  Well, I'm a little stressed.  And I've been taking pills to get my weight down since the baby.
And the doctor said they might make me a little jumpy.  I've got a ghastly headache, actually.
I'd love a Xanex.  Sally, please don't tell Sophia that I'm not breast feeding.
You know Sophia.  She's so damned judgemental.  And she's so damned... perfect.  And so fucking... serene.  Just fucking don't tell her.  Because you know Mac thinks she's God.  And I can feel him comparing.
Just don't fucking tell her.
I'm the hired help.
I never put myself in harm's way.
Let me.  I'm Jeffrey.
And you know our friends, how?
Oh.  You're them.
We've heard lots about you.
I'm fine, babe.  I'm gonna take a little walk.  I need a minute.  Let's forget it. My life didn't pass in front of my eyes. So, it probably wasn't that close.
Happy anniversary, baby.
Of course we do.  We have to sign our taxes.
I think we should all take it tonight. Everyone's staying, stays.  No driving. That's the rule.  I love you Sally-Mae. You're going to have a fabulous time.
No.
Pretty much a disaster, tonight, wasn't it?
Life gets messy.  Ugly messy.  But I don't understand you.  And I don't think I ever understood Lucy.  I don't understand throwing it away.  How do you throw all that away?  Any of it.  I want it all.  You guys want guarantees?  I want the possibilities.  And all kinds of crap comes with that.  A lot of bad shit. And I think that's okay with me because, because of the rest of the stuff.  All the good shit.  All the surprises.  It's a fucking miracle when you come down to it.  We'd have had amazing children, you and me.  We'd have had a ride.  You'd have surprised yourself.  I'll never love anybody else, you know.
That's under lock and key.
You lose this?
Are you okay?
I didn't say a word.
Jesus Christ, it's a fucking dog!
What?
Otis!!  Shostakovich identified with the Jew.  He felt persecuted, hunted, crushed under the thumb of Stalinist imperialism.
Andre Zhdanov?  How the hell do you know about Andre Zhdanov?
I'll tell you who doesn't know, cute girls don't know.
Otis you crazy dog!  Otis are you in this God forsaken Canyon?  My people are very hungry.
Set to the poem of Yetveshenko!
Do you really, you really, like Shostakovich?
Would you, like, marry him?
How about someone who really really liked Shostakovich?
No, I'm just testing to see how deeply perverted and impulsive you are.
Oh good, I'm worse... Are you really twenty-two?
Panes?
You don't need to do that.
Break's over.
What a bunch of losers.  Mindless zombies capitulating to an oppressive system --
Gee, uh, could you say it a little louder, I think there are some ants in the next colony who didn't hear you.
That's not what you said the <u>other</u> <u>night</u> --
-- At the <u>worker bar</u>!  You were pretty hot to trot then!
This lake is huge!  And so close to the colony!  Think of the vacation potential!
Bala, that -- that lake we found -- I think the tunnel's right underneath it!  -- Formica's going to <u>flood the</u> <u>colony</u>!!!  That's what he meant when said there were too many ants!
You just stick by old Barbatus. He'll watch out for you.  Whatsamatter, kid?  Leave a girl behind?
No -- we're going to attack the termites!
Dammit, this tunnel is priority A-1! We can't afford <u>any delays</u> on this project!
Wow, what a spread -- you know, there's a food shortage in the rest of the colony.
...Not enough food?
...I should?
You have to help me.  Please, Weaver. Think of all the things I've done for you!
Well I'm gonna <u>start</u> doing things for you...
You bet!  They'll really go for a sensitive guy like you!
Mrs. Dreyfuss, can I borrow some coffee -- and maybe an orange and a couple of eggs?
Ma'am?
I didn't really do anything -- honest -- I mean, you take a girl out a couple of times a week -- just for laughs -- and right away she thinks you're serious -- marriage-wise.
I hope everything goes all right.
You all right? What's the matter?
Miss Kubelik, I'm stronger than you are --
What do you call it when somebody keeps getting smashed up in automobile accidents?
That's me with men. I've been jinxed from the word go -- first time I was ever kissed was in a cemetery.
I was fifteen -- we used to go there to smoke. His name was George -- he threw me over for a drum majorette.
You can't leave yet. The doctor says it takes forty-eight hours to get the stuff out of your system.
Oh.
No. You know how people talk. So I decided it would be better if we didn't see each other till everything is settled, divorce-wise.
Good night, Mr. Baxter.
Been hearing some very nice things about you -- here's a report from Mr. Dobisch -- loyal, cooperative, resourceful --
And Mr. Kirkeby tells me that several nights a week you work late at the office -- without overtime.
Mr. Vanderhof, in Public Relations, and Mr. Eichelberger, in Mortgage and Loan -- they'd both like to have you transferred to their departments.
Morning, gentlemen.  Everything satisfactory? You like your office?
Now you're being bright?
That Kubelik -- boy!  Would I like to get her on a slow elevator to China.
I'm a pretty good operator myself -- but she just won't give me a tumble -- date-wise.
A lot of guys around here have tried it -- all kinds of approaches -- no dice.  What is she trying to prove?
Make it thirty minutes.  What do you say, Bud?
Let me worry about that.  Just leave the key under the mat and clear out.
She going to be all right, Doc?
How's the patient?
Not so rough, honey.
Good night?
What's the matter? Did I do something wrong?
Please -- just let me sleep.
I have that date -- remember?
Please, Sylvia!  It's a quarter to nine!
Sylvia -- sweetie -- it's not that -- but I promised the guy I'd be out of here by eight o'clock, positively.
Look -- you know who that is, Captain -- you know what she's saying -- you'll never see stuff that good outside of a magazine for the rest of your life.
Take your pick -- they all like you -- I can tell --
Good -- like I said, take your pick.
That's good gin.
Delta ?
North ?
What unit were you with ?
Rangers, eh?
What do you see?
Can I go get those mangos now?
Yeah, Chef -- go ahead -- take Lance with you --
Rocks, sand -- those two men who deserted.
Jesus -- that guy's too damn much.
What -- happened here.
American weapons?
Where've you been riding, Lance?
Big Duke Six to Hell's Angels Four -- bring it in on along tree line and huts.
You know, some day this war's gonna end..
Gimme water.
No -- no, Captain.
You don't know how happy that makes me, sir.
Now I can get out a here -- if I can find a way out.
I'd just clear out as soon as I could if I were you, sir. They're gonna start working on the bridge with torches again. Charlie will start throwing it in hard --
Are you warm, Captain?
20   CONTINUED:  
First you save my ass, now you want to kill me.  Make up your goddamn mind.
119  CONTINUED:  
A certain sonofabitch bastard -more-
What are you doing?
High-tech in the wilderness. Gets me excited, too.
Had no choice...  ...Given the situation.
Been driving long?
Most dangerous thing in the world: A regular Joe, in over his head.  You trying to prove how tough you are for me, or for yourself?
Let's camp.  There's grayling under this ice. I'll snare some for dinner.
Stay still.
Emergency transmitter?  All your gear is back at Wilder's.
It was blown up with the plane.
Emergency transmitter?  What happened to signal mirrors or two-tone smoke fires?
All this for laying traps on private land?
I was just on my way to your ladyfriend's, but I guess she found you.
...You give us a ride in the Cessna you got hangared at the pumping station, we'll be in Fairbanks in a few hours.
Thought that door was open last night...
This is Sam Wilder, Marshal in Devil's Cauldron.  Had some killings here.  I got a suspect; be real nice if someone came and took him off my hands.
Next plane's not coming 'til next Monday.
This man's friends ain't gonna look favorably on his incarceration.
Hi...  Did you know there are doctors who come to your house?
The table's fine if it had some cholesterol on it. Two sausages, six bacon strips, fries, three eggs over easy and coffee.
What about your mother?
So. Anything else?
Okay.
Hey -- you let him...
Two crab dinners and pitcher of cold beer.  Baked or fries?
I don't want to hear that music right now.
I don't.
No! It's certainly not. No -- I don't think so. No.
One night with me!
Simon, you've got to get dressed.
Take my car -- a convertible. Do you drive?
Frank loves you. You know that... but I've spoken to him and he feels that --  -- as a businessman, with limited resources...
Did you... do something to him?
No, I didn't.
No...  actually, I even shut the phone off and put a little piece of cardboard in the ringer so no one can just buzz me from d...
Yes. It's not a subtle point you're making.
I haven't been sleeping. I haven't been clear or felt like myself. I'm in trouble. Some son of a bitch is burning my bridges behind my back...  But the tiredness -- boy...  Not just sleepy.
I told you to go on in.
Nothing. I just watch till something strikes me. Do anything you think of -- try different thing. Until I say, "hold that pose." Then just try and comfortably hold it.
Sit back.  Put your seatbelt on.
No, no.  Wait.  You don't want me to jump.  You're going to jump.  I'm stuck back here until it's too late. Wham -- over!
How in the fuck do you know that?
Deadline?
Get on the expressway.
Who is that other guy?
Someone hired both of you?
So this is something between you and him?
Why?
He wants to kill you?
Why?
And you want to use me to get him?
Forget it!
He was... taken.
What will you do if this works, if we get the money?
This is the bank.  This is the hotel.  In the morning I will enter the bank.
He will be hidden somewhere out here, probably somewhere low, in the crowd.  He'll stay there until he sees me enter the bank.
What are you doing?
That's a ridiculous move.
Because, I'll take it.
Hi.  Did you call --
Is that all you want?
You wish to close this account today?
How would you like the funds?
This will take some time.
How to make a buck!
Because it's in English?
But we are underground?
Oh yeah, what's that?
I ain't sure poetry will go down too well here.
Squatted it.
No, but like my dad said, "There's only so many ways you can wire a plug".
No, he was talking about girls, I think.
It must be on the other side of this.
Afternoon!
No, not if you've got better things to do.
Get me a couple of beers and a salami.
No, We aren't going to do it.
They're good guys..... Have you seen Holly?
Damn!
Yeah. I tell you, they're one big happy family over there.
I don't know, I'm waiting for the transcript.
Well, the trial's in two weeks, but I think they've already sentenced me. They just need to check if Siberia can slot me in.
Now you're using that word.
I made a deal with Josh.
It was a condition of getting Doug out.
In return for Doug's freedom, I was never to see him again, I had to - it was his only chance.
Hey, Lawrence how are you doing mate?
I've been around.
No! Look Lawrence, I've taken over the lease on a theatre downtown and I'm throwing a party tomorrow night to show it off. It's going to be for alternative arts, but I need some help to finish it off, can you put the word out?
It's just talk, he's drunk.
She's tired.
I don't understand, it's your home?
No thanks, I must go, but maybe you could get some beers for the guys.
Will they free me?
Will this thing take long?
You mean it's started?
How do I know what's being said?
I'd better get you to a hospital.
This is your doing?
And you broke into that room?
You will wish you hadn't.
We had a deal!
Josh!
Why are there still such headlines?
You know everyone can be controlled Pavel. Where are you storing the personnel files?
You are quite sure it's secure?
That's one girl who can't take a hint.
A late night or an early morning?
Were you with Jamie?
I'm thinking.
Who are you?
You.
I know you don't want help.
Like you'd know.
I'm building a larger one to see the nucleus of Haley's Comet --
Yeah.  I'm probably not going to be around next time it comes.
He okay?
Hey.
The cells in our bodies are always changing. In six or seven years all your cells have changed. You could be like a completely new person from the inside out.
Come on.
What's the best thing I can see tonight?
Are you frightened?
'Love is always patient and kind. It is never boastful or conceited -- '
Did you give him a gift?
I saw the way he looked at you. The way he kissed you.
Boys like him have -- expectations.
This week.
You've been well?
No way. No thanks. I can't do it --
What's N.R.C.?
Then you'll be going to school here....?
By the way, that reminds me...  Saturday night we're taking Grandma Stella out for Chinese food.
Oh, no! That was for the cafeteria! This is different!
Huh?
You know damn well that's not what I meant.
Been any place unusual in the past twelve hours?
A time machine! Because of that Coke?!
Jeez -- this is where you used to live, huh? You must have been rich!
I told you not to interfere with any of the events of this time! Nobody's supposed to see you here! What if I was a mailman? Or a salesman?
Then I would have figured out to get back in through the events in the natural course of history! Don't you understand? The fabric of history is very delicate. Anything you do could have serious consequences!
That's all taken care of.
But if you didn't rebuild the time machine, how did I go back in time in the first place?
No... You go in there, I'll have to kill you.
Don't you ever get bored around here?
Well, Kit...
Good luck to you.
I mean it.
Oh, incidentally, my last name is Carruthers. Sounds a little too much like "druthers", doesn't it?
My stomach's growling.
How you doing?
Hey, why're you always walking ahead of me?
What?
Good deal... Oh, uh, we're on the run and we'd like to hang out here for a while. Couple of hours, maybe. How'd that be?
Think I'll take the juice?
Rawhide tells me Dr. Lizardo escaped...
That's me. I've been ionized, but I'm okay. I'm, switching on the homing beacon, mark two minute intervals.
Running a little late, Buckaroo.
I lack the authority, Buckaroo Banzai.
Got a casualty list?
Did you have family there--? A sister?  In Cody?
Another 'you'?
Adopted.  I should have know. Of course. If it was a snake, it'd bit me!
Not too terrific, sir.  I apologize for the interruption but something very unusual has reared its ugly head in outer space, and it looks like the Earth's caught in a crossfire.
Pick those up, Reno.
Now twenty seconds downrange...Perfect Tommy, how on earth is Buckaroo able to keep that thing on the ground?
If you could, I'd 
M'honey pretends to be impatient with me, Barton, but she'll put up with anything.
Ever talk to him?
Look, maybe it's none of my business, but a man with your talent  don't you think your first obligation would be to your gift? Shouldn't you be doing whatever you have to do to work again?
I don't know exactly. But I do know what you're doing with that drink. You're cutting yourself off from your gift, and from me and Audrey, and from your fellow man, and from everything your art is about.
What's that?
I thought you were going to join us. Jesus, Garland, you left me alone with those people.
And what's your line, Mr. Meadows?
Oh, yeah. An ear infection, chronic thing.  Goes away for a while, but it always comes back. Gotta put cotton in it to staunch the flow of pus. Don't worry, it's not contagious.
...All right now, when I say "Ready... wrestle!"  you try and pin me, and I try and pin you. That's the whole game. Got it?
...Your room does that too?
Jesus... You're leaving.
To be honest, I don't go to the pictures much, Mr. Lipnik 
...Yes, thank you.
Yes sir.
Is this multiple choice?
Ya know, Fink, ordinarily we say anything you might remember could be helpful. But I'll be frank with you: That is not helpful.
Mr. Lipnik, I 
Take care, you hear?
You're on leave, man.  You're on psycho leave.  I'm talking to a possible whacko here.
What are you doing here?
How do you know Catherine Tramell saw my reports?
She must really be something.  From a clinical point of view.
What are you doing here?
I told you -- I quit.
Sure.
Tell me about Professor Goldstein.
Say -- "What do you want from me, Catherine?"
How about Roxy?  Is she a fuck to the century, too?
No.
You still think I kill people, don't you?
Did you ever engage in sado- masochistic activity with him?
Did you ever tie him up?
He was walking home from work. They only lived a coupla blocks from the clinic.  Somebody drove by and shot him.
.38 revolver.  Never recovered.
No suspects, no motive.  Unsolved.
I had another one of you guys down here from Frisco -- about a year ago -- he asked me the same question.  What's this about anyway?
Yeah, he said it was routine too. Now it's two guys saying it's routine.
Nope, can't say that I do.
What's goin' down, son?
It doesn't make sense.  She didn't know me three months ago.
Not unless she got up in the ring and turned into one mean sonofabitch.
I love it.  She's got a hundred million bucks.  She fucks fighters and rock and roll stars.  And she's got a degree in screwing with peoples' heads.
You knew her, didn't you?
I told you to stay away from Tramell.
He died -- about five or six years ago.
Jean Michel, this is Mary Boone. She's got the great new gallery.
After the show we should take a nice long vacation. Maybe go to Hawaii. That's what I'm gonna do. I'm going to give up painting and start playing music again. I wanna sing.
It's great that people are interested, but if anyone's going to buy anything, I'll handle it for you. Everything goes through the gallery, even if they come to your studio.
Jean Michel... Crawling from the wreckage?
Paint it out.
Come on, Jean. Get rid of your cigarette. Concentrate.
I don't really have any problems.
What's your fuckin' problem? You get a girlfriend and a little attention and then start acting all uppity with me.
... I'll buy you some new ones.
So. Are you ready? I start Columbia next fall. Of course, there's like, a year of pre-med stuff, but  whatever. I'm really excited.  And: Rene gave me a job as his secretary. His poems are getting published.
Hi.
I've seen you before. I like your paintings a lot. Your hair was different.
Some of them.
Fuck band practice... If you're gonna be a painter you're gonna have to break a few hearts  you don't wanna be like Tony Bennett..
Singing on stage and painting in your spare time.
YO! Jean, this is Ramellzee.
Uh-oh!
Where's the fire?
Once you were their freak, now these clowns do your bidding. Must feel pretty good.
What're you really after?
... Maybe I'll watch it on TV.
... and me.  No, that's be me and me.  Is that what I said?
Hmm.  Primitive ventilation.
No.  No glass on the inside.
I'll warm ya!  I got hot mitts --!
Appetite for destruction? Contempt for the czars of fashion? Wait don't tell me ... Naked sexual charisma?
You buy this "blurry" business?
Bu ... wh ... I ... I mean ...
... Where did curiosity get the cat?
And a very, very good one.
I'm sorry.  I was too late.
I came to give you your freedom, a chance to live the life you choose. The same gift you gave me.
But I can't can I?
Alfred, are you...?
Youwsa!  Nothing but air.
Nice suit.  And today you are?
This is all about fashion for you, isn't it?
No beauty...
No!?
I need the Wayne Diamonds.
Absolutely.  Just as soon as you take ten hours training in the simulator.
Dick, you were reckless.  You could have been killed.
No gun.  How disarming.
Prepare for a bitter harvest. Winter has come at last.
Dr. Isley?  Pamela?  You look great. Especially for a dead woman.
Maybe they're right.
May I help you, Master Grayson?
Welcome to my parlor said the Riddler to the Bat. How's tricks?
How can I help you, Mr. Wayne?
The style of the letters I'm getting matches those found at the crime sites. Why would The Riddler be sending me riddles?  Who's your decorator? U-Haul?
The last entry read, Bruce insists on seeing a movie tonight.  Bruce insists. I made them go out. I made them take me to the movie. To that theater...  It was my fault. I killed them.
...Not the bat?
I always thought it was the bat that scared me that night that changed my life. But it wasn't. The real fear was hiding underneath: what I read in the journal, that my parents' deaths were my fault. That's what I couldn't remember. That's the crime I've been paying for all these years.
Who is The Batman, Edward?
How'd you find us?
We want to dust him. We truly want to dust him bad.
Like your boyfriend. He's kinda hot.
Gosh, I could kill you, but then you'd miss my party. And you, Batman -- you're the guest of honor!
The Joker is a murderer. And you were as good as dead. So --
All right, I'll develop the photos. Anything I don't want is yours.
I assume in my usual charming manner I've just insulted the host.  Alexander Knox.
Great.  Give me a grant.
I'm sorry, Bruce, I Just can't seem to get a handle on this conversation.
It's like the last time. He sent me a present before he --
SOMEBODY'S KILLED THE POWER!!
SOMEBODY'S KILLED THE --
You shouldn'ta turned the gun on that kid, man.  You shouldn'ta --
All right, then. Here's the deal. Total amnesty... and the sum of ten million dollars, payable in --
Please! We'll talk. Just tell us what you expect.
God, Vick, a girl could get hurt doing this.
Oh, it's too good.  We got a six-foot bat that swoops out of the night and preys on evildoers.
Small so far.  I think he's leaving the big fish for Harvey Dent.
Yep.  He watched the whole thing happen - - Recognize the beat cop?  Jim Gordon
Jennifer can stay and look after Kevin
Yeeees?
There aren't hotels?
And what did you say?
Ali?  What's wrong?
Here, let me do that.
Seems to be a problem with the door. Where's the picture gone?
Everything okay, David?
He's just parking the Governor's car.
So, why not haul your ...  nice little ass into this room and explain to me and my wife why our precious daughter is going to be absolutely fine because of all the fantastic intelligence and attention you are going to give her case.
Well, congratulations.  Isn't that great, David?
As you can see, security's pretty tight in this section.  Nobody gets past Elmer here.  Isn't that right?
what a pleasure, Governor.  Welcome.
Huh huh huh. He said "anus."
Dammit! Huh huh. That chick wants me.
So, uh, huh huh. Are we gonna score now?
Beavis, huh huh, what'er you doing?
Uh...
Well where is she?!
Beavis.
You must bow down to the Almighty Bunghole.  Heh heh, this is cool.  Bungholio-o-o-o-o-o!
Why does everyone wanna see my schlong?  I am the one-and-only-almighty-bungholiooo!
What the hell...? Bork! That bus we picked up. Where was it headin'?
She's holed up in a hotel room in Las Veags. Your flight leaves in a couple of hours. Now c'mon, I'll drive you to the airport.
Really? That's where we're from.
You scored with two chicks?!
Jane said we should sell the house to someone with a family.
I don't like situations like this. I hate it when I'm not in control. So just tell me the basics.
There are a thousand things... Why did you disappear when you walked off the front porch?  Is this a punishment?  Are we halfway to heaven or are we halfway to hell? And how long is this going to <u>last</u>?
Look in the index... maybe there's, like an emergency number or something.
I feel really stupid.
Honey.  Let's go.
Oh, Adam, don't tease her.  You never got an A in science in your life!
Did you get the paint?
<u>Barbara</u>?!!
I don't like Charles Deetz particularly, but you could have <u>killed</u> him.
If I had seen a ghost at your age, I would have been frightened out of my wits.
Mr. and Mrs. Maitland?  I've come for the last time.  Where are you?  Barb...
Yes, of course you are.  Well, Otho had an intuition.  Call it a hunch -- that it was going to be a fabled monstrosity of a house.  And it certainly is.  Charles, you're lucky the Yuppies are buying condos, so you can afford what I'm going to have to do to this place. We are talking <u>from the ground</u> <u>ups'ville</u>!
Yeah, maybe if he's nice, he'll let me hang myself from a rope in his barn.
Now, let's get back to business. I want to get Maxie Dean and Sarah up here immediately.  I can make history here!  I'm going to turn this sleepy little backward town into a leading supernatural research center... and amusement park.
I can't believe you are doing this to me!  <u>Ghosts</u>.  I am giving a dinner party for seven people tonight.  Otho has agreed to come back for the demolition of the attic.  My agent, Bernard, is bringing some woman who writes for <u>Architectural Digest</u>.  In fact, no one here tonight has not been in <u>Vanity Fair</u>.  Except you.
What do you think?
Are they still here, Otho?
Perhaps if I were properly motivated.
Chauncey, there you are. What are you doing on that leg?
Some pain is to be expected...  ... And I think what would be best for the two of you is a good night's rest.  ... It's late, I'm afraid it's time for my patients to prepare for bed.
I don't think that's entirely true, Grover.
Well, Mr. President... They don't quite know what to think.
May I ask your name?
Pardon me, was that Mr. Chance?
Oh... Mr. Gardiner... Mr. Chauncey Gardiner... You're not related to Basil and Perdita Gardiner are you?
Chauncey!
Your leg must be getting better.
Good. I'm glad to hear that.  ... How did you like meeting the President?
... You know, Chauncey... I want us to be...  I want us... You and I to become... close... I want us to become very close, you know...?
Hello, Mr. Gardiner. This is Sid Courtney, Washington Post.
I'm sorry to disturb you, Mr. Gardiner, I know you must be very busy.
Then, I'll be brief. I covered the President's speech at the Financial Institute today, and since the Post would like to be as exact as possible, we would appreciate your comments on the meeting that took place between Mr. Rand, the President and yourself.
Good, sir. And so, it seems, did the President - but we would like to have some facts; such as, uh... What exactly is the relationship between yourself and that of the First American Financial Corporation?
Of course. But since he is ill I'm taking the liberty of asking you.
So you know your Krylov in Russian, do you? Mr. Gardiner, I must confess I had suspected as much all along - I know an educated man when I meet one!
Yes, it is very good!
Ho! Ho! A dash of American humor! Vladimar Skrapinov!
It's a very pleasant room, Ben.
We could do it now, we can go upstairs.  ... Please, it's time for us. Come upstairs.
Watch? You mean just watch me? Doing it alone?
Well, if that's what you want, then I want it too.  We can go this way.
Tell Eve? You mean Mrs. Rand?
I am allowed to go to the attic and select any of the Old Man's suits. They all fit me very well. I can also take his shirts, shoes and coats.
... That is a very small room.
Come now, Mr. Gardiner, before his speech at the Financial Institute the President consulted with you and Benjamin Rand, did he not?
I know that, Mr. Gardiner.
Well, let me rephrase the question; the President compared the economy of this country to a garden, and stated that after a period of decline a time of growth would naturally follow. Do you go along with this belief?
Have you served in the Army?
Do you agree with Ben, Mr. Gardiner? Are we finished? Or do you think we can stimulate growth through temporary incentives?
... In the garden?
Eve, child! How nice of you to come.
Yes? What have you found?
Quietly, please. Mr. Gardiner, for one, understands our language.
What do you mean there is nothing? That's impossible.
I just wondered if you had gone over my speech, Ben.
... Well?
Well, Ben... I...
When you say, I can be somebody else, what do you mean exactly?
Don't be ridiculous. There is no such thing as a portal into someone else's brain.
I want to try.
I want to be John Malkovich. Tomorrow morning. Plus I'd like to meet this partner of yours.
Now?
What about Maxine?
Holy shit, yes!
Holy shit! He said what I said!
Don't toy with Floris, Schwartz. Why, if I were eighty years younger, I'd box your ears.
One hundred and five. Carrot juice.  Lot's of it. I swear, it's almost not worth it. I piss orange. Oh, and I, have to piss sitting down... like a godamn girly... every fifteen minutes. But nobody wants to die, Schwartz.
No sir-e-bob, I don't die. But what I do is get older, wrinkled like a former plum that's become the wrinkled prune you see before you. Oh, to be a young man again, maybe then Floris would care for me.
I don't want to be your godamn link, damn you. I want to feel Floris' naked thighs against my own. I want to know passion. I want my body to inspire lust in that beautiful, complex woman. I want her to shiver in a spasm of ecstasy when I penetrate her. Oh, God, the agony of the flesh, Schwartz.
I like you. I don't know what it is exactly.
No, no, it's your energy or your attitude or the way you carry yourself or...
Okay. Here it is.  Ever want to be someone else? Now you can. No kidding. Only two hundred dollars for fifteen minutes. Visit J.M. Inc., Mertin-Flemmer Building. etc., etc.
Hello, Don.
Don, I was wondering, do you know why our workplace has such low ceilings?
I missed you. I'm sorry. Tell me the plan.
Can you do that? I mean, do you know anything about puppetry?
I was just asking. No disrespect intended.
Fine. I mean, it's not like I was doubting you, it's just that I know puppetry is a skill that takes a long time to acquire.
You know I think it pays to leave juice-making to the trained professionals. You look terrible, my dear.
Hmmm, a lesbian, are you? I must inform you that I find that highly arousing.
What?! That is not allowed. My God, you are supposed to be one of us. You know you must never partake of Malkovich by yourself!
Oh, didn't anyone show you the indoctrination video?
Oh my darling. Oh my sweetheart.
So, do you enjoy being an actor?
Stay in him forever?
Well, we'll have all the money in Malkovich's bank account, plus he still gets acting work occasionally.
No one would ever have to know its not him.
Captain Mertin?
I am not a child, Captain Mertin, but rather an adult lady of miniature proportions.
I am not asking for alms, but rather the ear of a kind man with a noble heart.
...All I remember is how she loved the bottom of burned bread. Her little hands...I wouldn't know 'em if they slapped me".
Well, is it now? How you getting along?
You on your way home?
They treating you right over at the Bodwins?
Should I wake her?
She likes to see you off in the morning.
Won't you be late for work?
Somebody new there. A woman. Thought you might know who she is.
I know Denver.
I know what I see.
True.
Can't locate him.
The church!
It's cold as charity in there! What he do that for? Any number'll take him in.
Why? Why he have to ask? Can't nobody offer? What's going on? Since when a black man come to town have to sleep in the cellar like a dog?!
NO! Shouldn't be no days! You know all about it and don't give him a hand? That don't sound like you, Ella. Me and you been pulling colored folk out the water more'n twenty years! Now you tell me you can't offer a man a bed?! A working man who can pay his own way?
Why's that necessary all of a sudden?
You know he's colored? What else there to know?
It's her, ain't it?
Sethe. He took up with her and stayed in there and you don't want nothing to-
What, baby?
Aw, girl. Don't cry...Me and you, we got more yesterday than anybody. We need some kind of tomorrow...
Manolo will load it into your car for you, uh, Dude.
A dick, man!  And let me tell you something: I dig your work. Playing one side against the other--in bed with everybody--fabulous stuff, man.
Hey hey, I'm not messing with your special lady--
Hey, man, I'm not--
The Gundersons.
Yeah.
Where you going, Dude?
Your phone's ringing, Dude.
Burkhalter.
It's already posted.
Who's in pyjamas, Walter?
Ahh, not so good, man.
Uh-huh.  That some kind of Eastern thing?
Who the fuck are you, man!  Come on, man!
Who the fuck are you?  Why've you been following me?  Come on, fuckhead!
Roy Orbison. . . Pink Floyd.
So...that doctor.
Come on Walter, it's just--it's Smokey.  So his toe slipped over a little, it's just a game.
I figure it's easy money, it's all pretty harmless.  I mean she probably kidnapped herself.
FUCK.
There is no fucking hand-off, Walter! At a wooden bridge we throw the money out  of the car!
But Walter, we didn't make the fucking hand- off!  They didn't get, the fucking money and they're gonna-- they're gonna--
Fuck me, man!  That kid's already spent all the money!
Sure you'll see some tank battles. But fighting in desert is very different from fighting in canopy jungle.
I mean 'Nam was a foot soldier's war whereas, uh, this thing should be a fucking cakewalk.  I mean I had an M16, Jacko, not an Abrams fucking tank.  Just me and Charlie, man, eyeball to eyeball.
You make everything a fucking travesty!
Huh?  No, she, she hit me right here.
Well, she's back.  No thanks to you.
Smokey Huh?
Bullshit.  Eight, Dude.
Bullshit. Walter!
Seems like he's doing me a favor, then.
No hemoglobin left. Their metabolisms are too fast.  They burn out.  That's why they're having to feed so often.  Their systems are self destructing.
You're hurting me.
I thought you were supposed to be watching our backs.
Must be hundreds of these skeletons here.
So you're going to do this?
I would hate to think you were losing your perspective.  Who do you think God favors in the web?  The spider or the fly?
From his father, of course.
This whole deal's giving me a serious case of the butt-willies.
What took you so long?
Guess you're not quite as invulnerable as you thought.
And you honestly expect me to believe all this?
I can't just leave. I have a life here, a career --
You let him go --  An hour ago you were ready to kill a man for less, this one didn't even talk.
Is he sick?
I can't -- I won't be able to stop --
Curtis, it's three in the morning. I'm really not in the mood for one of your practical jokes.
I thought you promised to give me some distance?
These archives are restricted to members of the House of Erebus.
You're wasting your time, Frost. Far greater scholars than you have tried to decipher these words. Whatever secrets they hold have been lost.
So what do you use, then? A stake?
I wouldn't go in there if I were you. It's best to leave him alone when he's like this.
What, are you alright?
No!
--I'm not staying here!
Oak?
So says her website.
Baby names?
You want me to scooch over next to you?
I don't know what it is, but there is something <u>happening</u> here, and it's starting to scare the living shit out me, and look, I'm just <u>not</u> going to argue the point anymore--you want to stay here, stay, but I've got to get the fuck out of here, and I'm begging you to come <u>with</u> me.
Then I'm going--
Beer and weed is what I've got.
There, what? I didn't see anything.
I take it back--she <u>wasn't</u> an actor. She's a nutjob.
What about night?
Same trees. They took Elly Kedward out to the same kind of trees.
--Cotter, where can I get on-line?
Nobody's going anywhere--
Cotter?
Cotter, I think she's right. Why would those guys go to all the trouble of stealing the camera and all this other stuff and leave the tapes?
How much of that stuff you guys been smoking?
Look at those marks--just like in the movie.
What's that?
That'd be up on your shoulder, maybe your lower back.
Slow it down, slow it down, whatever it is, we'll figure it out.
We are being fucked with here, someone or something.
Why in the world would <u>she</u>--
Like a blueprint for disembowelment.
Then just give me one of your explanations that all three of us'll buy.
...Ray stole a shitload of money from Marty. Until both of 'em calm down I'm not getting involved.
What?! Did Ray tell you that?
...Well I'll be damned.
...You called me this morning.
...Where is everything?
It'll pass.
You want to hustle me. I don't want to be hustled. It's as simple as that. Now that I've communicated, why don't you leave?
Christ, I'm getting bored.
What "what"?
I don't particularly want to talk to you.
You want me to kill 'em.
Well what?
...it's too damn risky.
Got a problem, Meurice?
I don't want to talk about it. Everything's okay now. I don't want to talk about it.
Detective Williams here. yeah. Tell him to go to Sergeant Milton. yeah, copy.  Well, Jeffrey, you found something which is very interesting to us. Very interesting. I know you must be curious to know more.  But. I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you not only not to tell anyone about your find, but also not to ask more about the case. One day. when it's all sewed up, I'll let you know all the details. Right now, though. I can't.
I was the same way when I was you age. I guess that's what got me into this business.
Because of your information I alerted internal affairs to check out Detective Gordon.  I had to keep on with him as if nothing was different.  He slipped off on his own when he found out we were going to raid Frank's place.
Not yet.
That oughta do it.
Yes.
Yes.
Nice guy.  Who's he?
That wouldn't be too good, would it?
Okay. I know you've been scared. now you want to scare someone.
Shut up.
Come on Dorothy.
Where have you been?  Oh God. they hurt him, Jeffrey. Jeffrey, Jeffrey, Jeffrey, hold me. HOLD ME. Oh God.
Come on. I wancha to meet a frienda mine. Raymond, get enough beer for Ben too.
I don't want to cause any trouble.
I guess Mike's got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon.
I'd like an ice-cold Heineken.
Okay. be careful.
What was that all about?
It's good to see you.
Just go over to Gelford and up to Vista. It's not far. Can you tell me any more about what you learned?
It's okay.
Thank you. Whatiya say we just enjoy the evening?
Hi Dad.
God. you scared me.
Nothing. I'm fine.
Please excuse me a moment, Jeffrey, and I'll get to the dishes.
Pleased to meet you finally, George.  I am Augusto Oliveras.
This is it for me.
Just everything.  You.  California.  The beach.  This spot right here.  I feel like I belong here, you know?  It just feels right.
Tuna, this is crap.
What the fuck is that?
It's nothing personal, George.  Just business.
That's over fifty-thousand dollars profit per kilo.
Oh my G-d.
Jesus Christ.  Jesus fucking Christ.
Getting it here is no problem.  Trust me.  I'll fly it in myself if I have to. What about supply?  How much can we get?
Jesus Christ, George, I don't see you in two years, and you show up at my door with a hundred and ten pounds of cocaine?
Jesus fucking Christ, Diego.  I ain't telling you.  It's just business.  Now, shut up.  You're driving me crazy.
Surprised to see me?
Mexico.
Barbara.
Thank you.  Have you been getting the money I sent you?
I like to come up here.  To make the decisions.  To be one with nature.
So, business is going good.  I've got this import/export thing going on in Miami that's been very profitable.  With my investments...
What the fuck?  Is he going to walk?
Source?  What about Derek?
You should have taken better care of me, you know?  You've been away a long time. Four years.  Say something.
California?  You can go anywhere in the world.  India.  Tibet.  Australia. Paris.  And you choose California?
What is it?  A Disneyland thing?
California, huh?
Ramon tells me you are looking for some mota.
Holy shit, Dulli!
But the NLF has always spoken of a strike as a demonstration ...
They seemed to be plausible this time. A general strike is a good argument for the UN.
But I haven't shot him.
What's important for me is that you let me risk my life for nothing.
I don't do that kind of thing.
You still haven't told me why you didn't let me kill him.
What do you think of the strike, Ali?
Why?
I've been waiting for you to get back.
So she knew about his heart?
What about the will?
Mrs. Crawford, you were Mr. Marsh's maid for nine years?
Did Miss Lawson and Mr. Marsh ever argue?
What did they argue about?
Did they argue the day before he died?
What was the nature of the argument?
She's innocent.
Objection!  May I remind Mr. Dulaney that the person on trial here is Miss Lawson -- not Dr. Paley.
Did Miss Lawson ever accompany Mr. Marsh to your office?
Just one last question.  What does the sign on your office door say?
Where did you meet Miss Lawson?
Did you ever see her again after that?
What eventually happened to your relationship with Miss Lawson?
Why?
I'm sure that every orgasm she had with me was faked.
What did he say?
Yes, I slept with him but that was a long time ago.
What do you have in your purse?
Frank!
Why not?
Is it against the law?
You lied to me!
I just left Joanne Braslow.  She told me she saw you doing cocaine at Marsh's house!
That's not good enough, Goddamit!
No, I don't have to believe you.  The jury has to believe you and answers like he's lying or she's mistaken aren't going to convince them.
Why would she lie?
What's that for?
Rebecca -- we shattered a man's life in open court.
He was only doing what he thought was right.
I know -- but she wants you to represent her if Cardenas files.
Because I told her you were the best criminal attorney we have.
The witness will answer the question.
Frank -- I know you're busy, but Michael asked me after dinner if you were angry with him.  He wanted to know why you weren't talking to him.
Why don't you talk to him now?
Albert's got the stomach flu.
No, it's not.  Now I get to pitch.
Not even if they're a dork?
It's a beautiful picture of her.
I thought everything WAS arranged.
I had no idea it's gotten that bad, sis.
Then why do you?
Madge?
So, how long you've been living here?
Mind if I smoke?
You ought to write these stories down.
"Making pictures." I like that. You really love what you do, don't you?
Why, do you think?
You sound like an artist.
You really don't need anyone?
Why doesn't it scare you?
Do you ever regret it? The divorce, I mean.
Do you ever regret not having a family?
But -- how can you just live for what you want? What about other people?
But no one in particular.
But it's not the same.
No, I'm just saying --
Just because someone chooses to settle down and have a family doesn't necessarily mean they're hypnotized. Just because I've never seen a gazelle stampede doesn't mean I'm asleep in the world.
You want to eat something?
I don't know why I'm so tired all of a sudden.
Am I too heavy for you?
You feeling better Franny?
Uh... Yeah. Yeah. She's real nice.
Well, she's... she's real pretty and ... and she's got a cute shape... she's a good sport, ya know, for laughs and  ... she loves fried chicken wings and beer.
We can't go back there.  Are you crazy? You saw --
Ugh.  Muchos moscos, man.  This is too much.
Tia ain't a chick.  She's family.  And don't forget it.
Don't poison your mind with that ghetto paranoia.  That's all just ways of people justifying their own failure.
Gotta be an in-ey and gotta be smooth. If it's ragged, it was picked too soon. Won't ever be ripe.  Second, it's got to have just a little give, here.  At the edges.  And last, but not very far from least...  You gotta get your nose in it and give it a gooooood, looooong sniff.
What it will be.
We'll have to sneak in.
Why couldn't you just tell him to let us in?
What are we doing down here?
No way man...
And damp, too.  Let's not forget damp.
You look mighty familiar to me.  You sure you're not from around here?
You shouldn't have hit me.
Caesar?  What is this?
Not bad.  What for?
What?
It couldn't have been.
It's impossible!
Tell them!  Tell them!
What did she do to you?
How's it going tonight, fellas?
I'm going to ask you where the money is.  Every time you don't give me an answer, I'm going to cut off one finger.
Cease, can I ask you something?
No joke, ma'am.  Please open the door.
Do you know him?
Caesar is your husband?
Isn't it obvious?  I'm trying to seduce you.
Fuck it!  I think you better leave.
The difference is, I can have sex with someone I just met, someone I hardly know, but to steal I need to know someone like I know myself.
What time did you say they would be there?
Any bodyguards?
He'll have to run.
No, Johnnie.  No goddamned phones. Not now.
They're putting together an agency oversight committee.  They're going to look through everyone's budgets. Treadstone is a rather sizable line item in my ledger.  What am I going to do about that?
And what if I couldn't do that?
Are you Treadstone?
Mr. Kane...  Come right in...please...have a seat.
You could buy a car for twenty grand.  You could buy this car.
And I don't get hurt.  I get twenty thousand dollars and I don't get hurt.
What if I say no?
So this is it, right?
He's dead isn't he?
He went out the window -- why? -- why would someone do that?
He came to kill us.
You knew he was coming.
I trusted you.
I don't trust anybody and I trusted you!
He had my picture!  He knew I was here!  He came here to kill us!
Oh, Jesus...
But the police --
-- we'll explain it --
-- there's two of us -- we'll tell them -- we'll just --
-- we'll tell them what happened --
xxxxxx
Where's the dog?
He run away often?
What?
...ervices.
Oh yeh? Where'd you get this from eh  out yer nostril?
Central Services don't take kindly to sabotage!
Mr. HELPMANN, what would you say to those critics who maintain that the Ministry Of Information has become too large and unwieldy ...?
Help me!
This is all a mistake! Don't you understand?!
I'm not a terrorist! You must know that! I'm not guilty! Get me out of here!
Please, I've got to find Jill.
What's she done?
Er ... no.
Er ... but I would've found out anyway.
Tell me about Layton.
You're a stupid, fat arsed, obstructive, fascist moron aren't you?
You think these are tits don't you?
I bet you'd like to touch them?
What's going on here?
Jill! What are you do ... I mean ... how did you ... Are you alright?
What happened to you after ...
There we go. Mrs. Veronica Buttle. What's the number on the cheque?
Alright. There's someone I want to check out. A woman called Gillian Layton.
I know her age and distinguishing marks. But I need an address or a place of work or something
What?  Look, let me use the console for a few minutes.
I hope you like it. It's very exclusive.
Really, Sam - when are you going to do something about these terrorists?
My name is Sam Lowry. I have to report to Mr Warren.
Er, don't you want to search me?
My I.D. cards.
But I could be anybody.
What the - ? How did you - ?
Are you expecting anyone?
It's okay, Kanita. Come on in.
They're gonna torch the fence. You're gonna feel the metal getting warm, maybe very warm.
You're not going to die.
You shouldn't smoke.
Excuse me. You seemed like you were in trouble.
Don't seem so bad to me.
She only works when I'm on. I make her wait and it drives her crazy.
Don't give me that look.
You know what I'm talking about. It's all over your face. That I-just- saved-a-little-baby-boy look.
He's dead, Rose. Your father passed.
He coded. They shocked him one too many times. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Whadda we bring?
Oh no!--I just remembered.
I'm so stupid. I had beef lo mein last night. I can't eat the same thing two nights in a row. It's almost two o'clock, what the hell am I gonna do? What you getting?
Oh yeah, you don't eat food.
He's crazy.
One source referred to it as a five billion dollar metal sculpture to ugly to look at and too big to bury.
You're feeling good, aren't you?
You packing up tonight?
London.
I don't think so.
Hold it down, okay?
Hi.  Turn on your TV... <u>Good Morning America</u>, the <u>Morning News</u> and <u>Today</u> are all about to talk to Arnold Schwarzenegger and I think he's live on at least two of them.
Now listen, Arnold just said that he's been making three million a movie now.  But he's not ever gonna change.  He's still the same person when he was making two million dollars a movie.  He feels no different.  He also bought a brand- new condo with Maria, they gonna furnish tastefully.
I think the pilot that shot down the Libyan in 1981 is stationed right here.  Maybe you could get him -- and maybe Tom should say that our F-14 is one of the hardest planes to fly. They're nicknamed 'Tomcats'.
How'd it go?
No.
Did it really go well?
Do you feel good about it?
Do others feel that you did well?
Then what was good about it?
Aaron, will you tell me?
What do you mean, flop sweat? -- you're making too much out of it...I'll bet you were the only one aware of it...
Stop kidding.  I want to know what happened.
There were complaining phone calls because you were sweating?
If all that happened, how come you're so chipper?
Why not try it for a few weeks?
Tell me the God's honest truth -- are you leaving because of me? Because if you are...
I had the strangest thing happen yesterday.  Anne and I have been married what? -- Thirty-six years... Everything fine -- two days after the promotion came through, I was checking myself in the mirror and she was making a face at me behind my back. So yesterday I looked in the mirror and she was doing it again.
We came from Washington.
How long has it been since you've been home.
Aaron should be hearing this so I have an extra witness.
No, I don't.  He happens to deserve the credit.  He's right here.
Go back to 316, Bobbie.  The sound bite in the cab -- it starts, 'I don't know how I'll feel...'
Hey, Buddy, don't do that anymore.
You know, Tom, I feel a little proud when people comment on your looks.  Maybe you should feel that way.
As long as that's your only problem you're...
Another thing I can't stand is ...when White House reporters bullshit with each other after a briefing and then one of them has a theory and the other quotes it in his story as "White House" sources say...
Yes.  My room is down here -- I'm not tired.  Do you want to keep talking?
I can't help you, sorry.  I'm not here to teach remedial reporting.
You have to celebrate with me, don't you?  Everybody's going to that bar on the corner, 'Caps.'
It's incredible who's here.
Hi.  It's me.
I can't get away just yet.  I'm at Aaron's.
I'm not sure.  It seems like he had sort of a mishap on the news.
It wasn't as bad as he think, was it? -- it wasn't unprecedented or anything?
I don't wan to discuss work.
I knew what you meant.
Where's the bathroom?
Well I'm touched.  You're serious, aren't you?
Alright we're clear.
Not really.  One girl who fit the descrip came in, kinda skinny, brunette, didn't see much changing hands.
Yeah, he's keeping an eye out, said he'd call us if he sees anything. That's about it for tonight.
How did you ever find it all in yourself, Walter?
Did you hear what he said?
Uh...  ...how long have you been thinking about this, Walter?
Walter...I can't believe it.
What's the matter with you?
I've never seen anyone so... squeamish.  Well, what's your opinion, Leonard?
I wonder what his deal is.
Well I brought something, I wanted to show you.
No, it's Ok...you came in early.  Besides, you're creating an incident. When people are applauding they don't order anything.
Look, go home and...work on something. Make another cat.
Well make a dog, make a parakeet! I'm sure you'll think of something.
A show..how soon can we go?
How ya doin'?
What are ya, deaf?  Turn around!
An' everyone will say Walter let me shake your hand...it's a real pleasure to have known you...
I want you to have it.  There's a little something for you in here...
I don't think this is gold.
Man has a complex.
Hey!  She wasted my dog!
Oh, my God.  Is that true?
What show is this?
Oh.  Who's in it?  I know what it is.  It's what's on instead of the movie.
I don't understand.
No, you didn't.  When?
You broke up with my machine?
You left me a message?
Do you do this kind of thing a lot? I mean, is this like a hobby?
They were vampires, weren't they?
I'm going to the dance.
In order to dance and to drink punch and to be with my friends. Comprende?
It's not a mixer.  It's the senior dance.  And it's important.  You wouldn't understand.
I don't want to kill anybody, and I don't want to talk about it anymore.
He did what he was supposed to.
Right.  I'm the chosen one.  And I choose to be shopping.
Bugs.
I didn't learn... I just... it's not a big deal.
I was a slave.
I don't know.  It was...  There was a big gram or something.  And there's one, I'm like a prostitute...
It's not pretty, but it does suit our purposes.
What!?!
None of the other girls ever gave me this much trouble.
You guys blow.  I'm waiting on Cassandra.  She's gonna help me with my history.
Yeah... She's okay, though.
No, wait.  I can be dumb.  Really. Or mean, or whatever.  I can learn. I'm useful.
She didn't even hardly talk to anyone in school.  All year.  She didn't even go to the prom.
Cool!
Buffy, the ape-woman.
Yeah maybe you're right.
I can't keep up with you.  First you say sex is gonna make me a better pitcher--now no sex is gonna do it?!
Nuke!  You got things all wrong! There's no relation between sex and baseball.  Ask Crash.
What'd he say?
He did?
Well let's get down to it, honey-- how was he?
See my hips?
I think Thomas Pynchon's a genius.
But you were pulling your hips last night.
God damn you--what is happening? Is there no man who'll have me?  This is the weirdest season I ever saw--the Durham Bulls can't lose and I can't get laid!
Ninety-five miles an hour.
Thanks for the note--you're right, I wasn't bending my back.
No, that is not belief.  That is desperation.
How come you don't like me?
What do I got?
Hey, I'm cruisin', man--what're you doing out here?!
Why?!  I'm finally throwin' the damn thing where I want to.
I'm trying to thank you.
Crash Davis?
I gotta go now, Dad.
No.  If I screw up, I wanta do it alone.  I'll call.
Dad--if my curveball is hanging, God ain't gonna help me.
Eight and twenty-four.
It's a miracle.
I mean, the guy is history as far as I'm concerned. History.
So what? Everybody out here with cowboy boots is a fuckin' county commissioner or related to a county commissioner. I'm fuckin' sick of it.
As far as the world was concerned Andy Stone, the head of the Teamsters' Pension Fund, was a legitimate guy.
A powerful man.
Okay, Randy. Thank you.
Now this is just a signature card.
...give him a shot at runnin' a casino and he tries to talk you out of it.
Holy shit, what've you been doin' out here?
No, I didn't know that. But you know what he did?
- no matter where he was or what he was doing, he always went home to make breakfast for his son, Nicky- Boy.
Yeah.
What - what, Caesar's?
...hundred yards further down the road.
Hey, it is my pleasure.
You know, I don't feel like playin' tennis.
Let's go to lunch. Do you want to go to the Riviera?
This woman's an institution.
She took care of the dealers...
...pit bosses, floor managers.
Crooked cops and kidnappers, they don't take checks.
It's okay.  Look...  ...you gotta get a hold of yourself.
If not for me, at least for Amy.
You understand? Your drinking's gettin' way out of hand. I'm gonna get you into a program. They got plenty of good ones.
Yes, you do. It's very discreet. There's no names in the papers. You don't have to worry about any of that stuff.
Yes, I - yes, I do.
How could you say that?  You're a beautiful woman. You're destroying yourself. You don't need that stuff. You don't need that fuckin' leech livin' off you. I know you better than you know yourself. You're a tiger, you're stronger than I am. And when you set your mind on doing something, you do it better than anybody.  You can do it.  You can do it.
Get off of me! Stop it!
Oscar wants you to call him.
With Jennifer.
To the Riviera.
I had a... salad.
She had the same.
Why do you want to do that?
Fine.  Just gonna get the bowl for my thing.
I won't let her in. I'm sorry, Randy, I'm not gonna let her in. She - Well, I'm not gonna let her in, the way she's behaving. I'm - I'm -
Who knows what you're gonna do in there? I don't want you -
It won't happen again, Sam.
Excuse me.
Is this yours? Your pen?
I ju- Well, it's a nice pen. I just didn't know whose it was. I thought it was yours. I didn't want it to get lost.
Yeah, that works out.
You need to understand, and I - I'm sure you do... that in a venture of this kind, you have to be prepared to take some kind of loss.
So I put some of the money into legitimate deals with Charlie Clark. He was Ace's banker.
Yes.
What do you want? It - It's pitch- black out here. It's tin foil.
It looked like a fuckin' gun!
Oh my God, what are we gonna do? I'm sorry.
You took your boots off? You put your feet on the table... you shit- kicking, stinky, horse-manure-smellin' motherfucker you!  You fuck me up over there, I'll stick you in a hole in the fuckin' desert! You understand?  Go over there and apologize.  Go! Get the fuck out of -
Yeah, I'm over here with him.
But back then the bosses didn't give a fuck about whether he enjoyed himself of not. To them, he was a cash register. All they had to do was ring the bell and take the money. Especially Remo, who was a fuckin' degenerate gambler who always lost.
He didn't have to hit him. It's not exactly like I'm sleepin' with the guy! And he makes me sneak around to see my own friends! What the fuck is that all about?
He gives a fuck what I do?
Okay.
He hates my fuckin' guts.
I'm not as tough as you think I am.
I'm not and he scares the shit out of me. I never know what he's gonna do.
I'm sorry.
- with stupid braces on your teeth.
Every time I ever see you, that's what I see.
Hey, how you doin'? 
Whenever we got local merch, we'd usually send it to Palm Spring or Arizona... LA. I had a couple of sand niggers out there. You know, Arabs.
I do all the work. Somebody don't like it, fuck him.
I fucked up, Frankie. I fucked up good this time. Should have never started with this fuckin' broad.
Hey! Oh!
What's the matter with you?
Since when do you talk like that?
There's a lot of people here.
Again!
That's enough.
Oh Man, not the sewer, I just had this cape cleaned...
Strange--you seemed so close. I wonder what's happened since yesterday..
Hmm. Not bad.
Selina, are you okay?
Oh Honey, it's so much better when we do it without the helmet.
Pass!
Boss-man, what were you going on about last night: "I am the Law and I am the Danish..."
Well, you don't see that everyday. Somebody tell me what's the deal with Frida Kahlo here?
Ah, the good guys always triumph in the end. It's what allows our children to sleep at night.
You know, Kyle, you're still pretty hot for a pre-Bicentennial babe...
Did you try to kill...
Nothing. How's your hand?
Like you don't know...
I said I saw you last night. What were you doing hiding in that alley, running off when the superhero alarm sounded...
A hearty breakfast is the start of a great morning...
Oh Mommy, you're embarrassing me.
Maybe.
Nice breasts.
Say something ...
I'm trying to help somebody. Okay?
Lady, don't let him do it!
I prefer to have the sucker die at a more convenient location.  Once Nels arrives with his backpack full of goodies.
I thought you said you could handle him.
No don't.  You could lose me for good.  Don't go through that tunnel.
Please.
Where's the fucking recharger cord?  Must be in her car, dammit.
I don't know.  80 or 90 minutes, tops.
I don't know.  I hung up on somebody else a long time ago, and later on I wished I hadn't of.
Hey drop it, okay?
It never healed.  I called her a lying bitch and everything else and I hung up on her.  "Click." You don't exist.
I sure as hell got my wish.  She doesn't exist.  So maybe you reached the appropriate person after all.
You said they wanted to get into some particular safety deposit box?
What bank?
It's locked.
Now you're starting to sound like a victim again.
Only in the leg or the thigh. You'd live but you just wouldn't wear shorts.
Yes I would.  Not kill you.  But blow off a few toes, absolutely. I'm entitled to that as retribution.  It'll help you to remember me in years to come -- every time you put on stockings. They must have prosthetic toes by now -- with little nails on them you can polish --
What's really on your wicked little mind?
That's a reasonable possibility.
What's your point?
Which one of us is elected to do the deed?
Naturally.
Maybe your friends already accomplished that chore for us.
I've got ... one last number for you, Theo ...
My fence in San Francisco ... 305-4410.  Maurice.  Don't take less than a third on the face value of those bonds.
We're waiting on you.
It's in the process.
You should've done all this before.
Her husband said there'd be one million eight.  So nine hundred to you.
Be careful in disposing of them. You'll have to discount 'em. You'll be lucky to clear a hundred and a quarter.
Negative.
And not a nickel.
And then?
And they run straight to the cops who start looking for our van.
You researched me.  You know where I live.  She'll be waiting for you there along with your split.
Tailgate me.  I'll jam on the brakes.  You go into a spin to avoid an accident and cut them off.
From what I can see you're a pretty fair wheelman.  There's a hairpin coming up -- that's the place for it. The cops'll plow right into you.
I'm in awe.
Scottish?
He agreed that he was.
See, they get the wrong idea.
Is that his tart? Does Pat have a tart?
No, of course not, she's a lady.
No.
How'd you guess?
And what's it like?
You want me to ask you in, right?
Someone out there.
Did he come here too?
Maybe.
Come on, Dil --
Don't.
I should have known, shouldn't I?
Kind of wish I didn't.
That's true.... Your soldier knew, didn't he?
Won't be quite the same though, will it?
Shouldn't be, Dil
Don't call me that --
Are you supposed to take that many?
See, I fix on anyone that's nice to me. Just the littlest bit nice and I'm yours.
Dil!!!
Fergus!
We had a court-martial in your absence. They wanted to put a bullet in your head. I pleaded for clemency. Said we should find out what happened first. So what did happen?
So you did fuck up.
But you know what the thing is, Fergus?
You vanished quite effectively. Became Mister Nobody. And you've no idea how useful that could be.
We've got some plans here. And we'll need a Mister Nobody to execute them.
Give him a cup of tea.
I'm getting emotional. And I don't want to get fucking emotional -- you understand, Hennessy?
Please, man, I'm suffocating in here.
Well, in Antigua cricket's the black man's game. The kids play it from the age of two. My daddy had me throwing googlies from the age of five. Then we moved to Tottenham and it was something different.
See? I was right about you.
Nothing.
Not here.
Give me the shooter, Jude --
When you come on, you really come on.
You're right. I remember Grandpierre looking through it. But there was nothing in it -- at least, nothing that the police thought was very important.
Grandpierre asked me about an appointment Charles had -- on the day he was killed.
I think it only said where -- but I can't --
That money's not ours, Adam -- if we keep it, we'll be breaking the law.
Of course there is!
You didn't have to chase me so hard --
Here's where you're to call me -- day or night. It's a direct line to both my office and my apartment. Don't lose it, Mrs. Lampert -- and please don't tell anyone about coming to see me. It could prove fatal for them as well as yourself.
We've no proof, of course, but we rather think so, yes.
Yes -- ?
Go ahead, Mr. Bartholomew -- I'm listening.
How long do you intend -- ?
We'd better exchange keys. Here's mine.
The phone's ringing --
Maybe somebody felt that four shares were too many --
Yes, I know.
What? Assassinate somebody?
I can explain if you'll just listen. Will you listen?
Okay. Then get set for the story of my life -- not that it would ever make the best-seller list.
Why don't you shut up!
Are you going to listen?
After I graduated college I was all set to go into my father business. Umbrella frames -- that's what he made. It was a sensible business, I suppose, but I didn't have the sense to be interested in anything sensible.
It led me away from umbrella frames, for one thing. But that left me without any honest means of support.
When a man has no profession except the one he loathes, what's left? I began looking for people with more money than they'd ever need -- including some they'd barely miss.
Well, it isn't exactly the term I'd have chosen, but I suppose it captures the spirit of the thing.
Well, I can't really blame you -- not now.
Sorry, the name's Adam Canfield.
The man's the same, even if the name isn't.
What do you mean, no?
If you will sign this list you may take the things with you.
Jean-Louis -- thank heavens! Do you have -- !  What's that?
Right there, between your eyes -- see? Worry lines. You're much too young and too pretty to have anything like that. How about making me vice- president in charge of cheering you up?
There was no trace of him. All right, Reggie -- suppose you tell me what this is all about.
What?
Stop that!
Do you know him?
He must have known Charles pretty well.
Yeah?
Why?
He should. Four guys hit on me today, and not because they find me intellectually stimulating.
You do?
Why'd you send for Lenny Marliston?
She's my daughter, Tom.
So you just don't point blank ask your teenage daughter about sex.
It was a she.
What are you doing?
You fucked me up!
You gave me a 'D'.
Go sit next to him.
Mark Shale.
Don't you want to talk to him? You watch him eat everyday.
Someone tried to kill me.
If you don't want to go with me just say so. Say 'Kenny, I DON'T WANT TO MAKE LOVE TO YOU' but don't use your dad as an excuse. I'm so sick of it.
Yes you are. You always do. It's why we broke up. You always hide behind him.
I feel like I NEED YOU DAD'S permission just to kiss you. Jody, it's time to assert yourself To be a big girl. An individual. I'm going to this party tonight. Jimmy's my ride. Come over to my house after school. We'll go together.
They're not picking me up until six.
Oh GOD IT'S HIM!
THAT'S why he called Mr. Sisler first. He was one of them.
You're so beautiful.
Now don't be nervous.
help me get in the truck. 
Let me put it in easy terms, Aristotle. We are carrying a damn bomb...
...if we don't get out of this tunnel!
We're clear.
    Elvis is on ice again.
 Nice job back there.
Don't gimme that "nice job" shit, man! They still got a vanload comin', and what do you got besides an empty...
I was thankin' you, asshole!

You're--?  What?!
You're not dangerous!  You're crazy!  I ain't gettin' in this damn thing!
...here!
 
Okay, here we go.
Come here.
Stupid.
Got it?   Come on, darlin'.  I gotcha.
They'll meet you at the top.
Give it to me now, or you'll be dead...
Yeah, that's my truck.
 ...to Fort McGruder in his truck. 
...take my sorry old truck.
Whoo-hoo-hoo!  Whoo-hoo-hoo!

 Move.  This is already affecting our schedule.
Carl!  Set up the camera.
Vaughn, get the M-seventy-nine ready.
Hello.

...-son.  Of all the days for you to show up late.  First, the idiot April calls in sick.  Then I got a bad tooth...
...it.
...-time,  remember?
...-fore he closes, which means you're gonna have to cover the grill and the floor.
Forty-nine?
Deputy Art Lewis, Jerome County Sheriff's Department.
I don't suppose you'd like to tell me what this is all about.
You're the only one I can trust.
...-m-means, Mason.  
Lying? 
...public drunkenness....
...beer.
...to talk, son.


It's too late, Mason. I've...
Then these are all new owners?
But that means that most of the valley's been sold in the last few months.
Can I check one of these volumes out?
Well, then, how about a ruler?
At my age, you tend to lose track...
You're absolutely right, I wouldn't give her another thought.
Thanks, Curly. Call me Jake.
What's that, Curly?
There's seven ashtrays in this room, Duffy.
That's a filthy habit.
You wouldn't happen to know the present whereabouts of the young woman.
Or her name?
What are you talking about?
...Well, it didn't make him happy...
No.
You see, somebody went to a lot of trouble here, and I want to find out, lawsuit or no lawsuit. I'm not the one who's supposed to be caught with my pants down... so I'd like to see your husband. Unless that's a problem.
May I speak frankly, Mrs. Mulwray?
Well, that little girlfriend, she was attractive in a cheap sort of way of course.  She's disappeared. Maybe they disappeared together somewhere.
Nothing personal, Mrs. Mulwray, I just --
Unless what?
Your father is Julian Cross, isn't he?
It was in Chinatown.
Working for the District Attorney.
Just tell me the truth. I'm not the police. I don't care what you've done. I'm not going to hurt you, but one way or another I'm going to know.
I said I want the truth.
Sophie... is Walsh there?... yeah, listen, pal, Escobar's going to try and book me in about five minutes... relax, I'll tell you. Wait in the office for two hours. If you don't hear from me, you and Duffy meet me at 1712 Alameda.
That's exactly what we wanted to hear.
I wonder, is it too late for us to have a look around?
Would you mind if we took a stroll on our own?
Speak English?... Habla Ingles?
No, really?
This?
What about?
Apple core?
Lots of fellas do. Tell the little woman they're going on a fishing trip, then shack up with some little twist on the island... she pretty?
Is the Pope Catholic? Who are you, mister?... I ask because he doesn't see a whole lot of people.
That right?... She used to be some looker.
She must be about thirty-three, thirty- four.
No, he's only got one, I remember her age, I read it in the newspapers when she ran away.
Now listen to what I've got to say. I took up this profession when I was ten years old. In those days there weren't these modern machines. The films were silent. The projectors were run by hand, like this, with a crank. And you wound the crank all day long. It was really rough going! If you got tired and slowed down' boom! Everything would go up in flames!
Because I don't want to, Toto! This is not a job for you. It's like being a slave. You're always alone. You see the same film over and over again, because you have nothing else to do. And you start talking to Greta Garbo and Tyrone Power like a nut! You work on holidays, on Christmas, on Easter. Only on Good Friday are you free. But if they hadn't put Jesus Christ on a cross...You'd work Good Fridays too!
Because I'm an idiot. How many other guys in town know how to be a projectionist? None! Only a jerk like me could do it. Besides I wasn't lucky. When I was a kid there was the war! When I grew up, another war! Now it's all different. Times have changed. And you want to be a dope like me? Huh? Answer me!
Good for you, Toto. Good for you... I'm only saying this for your own good...  Cooped up in here you die of heat in the summer and of cold in the winter. You breathe in smoke, gas fumes, and earn practically nothing. 
With time...you get used to it. Besides, when you hear from up here that there's a full house and that people are laughing, having fun... Then you're happy too.  So I've been wasting my breath? You pretend to agree with me, but as soon as my back is turned, you do what you want!  Get out of here! I don't want to lay eyes on you again! This is the last straw! Your mother's right, you're crazy!!  But how'd he do it? The little bastard! By watching, he's learned! It's incredible!  I'm letting the box office know you're not to set foot even into the theatre! There are no more tickets for you! And I'm also talking to Father Adelfio! You won't be an altar boy any more either!!! You little runt! 
Yes, it's a girl I saw at the station.
Thanks for all you've done for me.
Elena!...But when...
No, Salvatore...there is no future. There's only the past. Even meeting last night was nothing but a dream, a beautiful dream.  We never did it when we were kids, remember?  Now that it's happened, I don't think there could have been a better ending. 
But why do you call me 'Mr. Di Vita'? It didn't used to be that way...
I've just made a shocking discovery. The "Enquirer" is without a telephone. Have two installed at once!
Ask them to sit down, Mr. Bernstein.
We'll be on the street soon, Charlie - another ten minutes.
If you thought I'd answer different from what Mr. Kane tells you - well, I wouldn't.
I'm not criticizing, Mr. Carter, but here's what I mean.  There's a front page story in the "Chronicle,"  and a picture - of a woman in Brooklyn who is missing.  Probably murdered.  A Mrs. Harry Silverstone.  Why didn't the "Enquirer" have that this morning?
Let him finish, Charles.
Here I am, darling...  Darling!... Darling, it's all right...  Mother's here.
You can't blackmail me, Rogers, you can't -
Oh!
You'll never have another chance to hit me again.  I never knew till this minute -
Don't tell me you're sorry.
I'm going to leave you.
Impossible!  Impossible!
But, it is impossible.  I will be the laughingstock of the musical world!  People will say -
Mr. Kane, how can I persuade you -
Is Mrs. Kane - 
The "Chronicle" is a good newspaper.
Charlie, it's just no go.  We can't agree anymore.  I wish you'd let me go to Chicago.
Maybe we'd better wait for more word on the President's condition.
What's this?
David, Grobleski & Davis -  My dear Rawlston - 
Oh, yes.  I know about Mr. Rawlston.
Yes, and maybe he didn't.
I know, but -
How did you meet him?
Well, if it's already too late...
It's not the same.
Randal Graves-scourge of the video renter.
You saw that article? God, isn't it awful? My mother sent that in.
You'd think she was marrying him. What are you watching?
She said not to come home until graduation.
What can I say? He does weird things to me.
You can hold me down.
You might be let down. I'm not a hermaphrodite.
A woman's intuition. Something in me says it's time to give the old boy a serious try.
Dick.
So where is he?
God, isn't he great?
Can I use the bathroom?
Why aren't there any lights?
You're kidding.
Such a sordid state of affair.
Promise me it'll always be like that.
When you just lie perfectly still and let me do everything.
Well he asked me for it!
My point is that you're a clerk, paid to do a job. You can't just do anything you want while you're working.
Cute cat. What's his name.
Want something to drink? I'm buying.
Who was on your phone this morning at about two-thirty? I was trying to call for a half an hour.
Oh, it's great. You step into this little booth and there's this window between you and this naked woman, and she puts on this little show for like ten bucks.
Think of the weirdest, craziest shit you'd like to see chicks do.  These chicks do it all. They insert things into any opening in their body... any opening.  He's led a very sheltered life.
Are you gonna lock the store?
Look who you're asking here. How're we gonna block off the street?
I can't fucking believe you!!
You knocked the fucking casket over, for Chrissakes!
Does anyone ever knock over a casket on purpose?
Her fucking body fell out!
Who eats cock?
There's no lights back there.
I love your sexy talk. It's so... kindergarten: Poo-poo; wee-wee.
You still didn't have to choke me.
Why do you say that?
No, really. What did I do that was so wrong?
How do you figure?
Like ten after.
To talk to you.
It's not like I'm miles away.
Hermaphrodites! I rented it so we could watch it together!
Sounds to me like somebody needs to hit the gym.
I heard you strain when you put the milk in the bag. That milk only weighs about seven pounds.
I don't think so. That was a grunt; a deep inhalation of oxygen to aid in the stretching of muscles. I'm a trainer. I know what that sound signifies: you're out of shape.
Oh, I do. You made the same noise when you reached across the counter for my cash. Your muscles are thin and sadly underutilized.
Yes, they are. You're out of shape.
Noinch, noinch, noinch-smoking weed, smoking weed! Doing coke!  Drinking beers!  A pack of wraps, my good man. It's time to kick back, drink some beers, and smoke some weed!
Hell yes, whatever that means. Now I'm gonna head over to Atlantic, drink some beers, get ripped, and- please God-get laid.  E-Z Wider, one-and-a-halfs.
Pay the good man.  Don't you close soon?
We get off about the same time every night. We should hang out.  You get high?
Wanna come to this party tonight? There's gonna be some pussy there, man!
Listen to you. Oh shit. "Oh, I don't hang out with drug dealers."
How much money did you leave up there?
You're trusting.
How do you know they're taking the right amount of change? Or even paying for what they take?
Honesty through paranoia. Why do you smell like shoe polish?
Do you think anyone can see us down here?
Ooh! Can we?!
I was kidding.
Typically male point of view.
You show some bedroom proficiency, and you think you're gods. What about what we do for you?
"Be there?"
How flattering.
Oh, you think so?
And I actually date you?
I'm insulted. Believe me, Don Juan, it takes more than that to get a guy off. Just "being there"-as you put it-is not enough.
I'm astonished to hear you trivialize my role in our sex life.
You were making a generalization about "broads!"
How many?
How many girls have you slept with?
We might have; I don't remember. How many?
It better be up to and including me.
You've slept with twelve different girls?
What the fuck did you do that for?
What're you talking about?
It was only a few times...
A couple...?
Would you let me explain...
Oh shit, look who it is. The human vacuum.
Nothing. Just hanging out with Silent Bob and his cousin.
Check this out, he's from Russia.
Let me ask you a question: Do you think this guy's out of shape?
You've never heard anybody say anything about either movie?
Did you catch that thunder?
Jessie, Hal, come in...please report.  Over.
Glad you could drop in.
I think it's out.  No big deal. It's that old football injury.
I love you, too.
I'm going with you.
Take the gun.
Use your other hand!  Grab it!
If he gets up there and the weather gets as bad as it can, they'll never make it down.  He needs someone who has emergency medical training and knows every handhold on these peaks.
That's not the issue here, those people are.  He can't do it alone.
What if he can't?
Why can't things stay the way they are...everything has to change.  What we had was perfect.
They'll kill him!  He has no idea!
But maybe with a good start I can hit those hand-holds.
We don't have time to argue about it!
Take the rope.
Take the rope.
Wrap it around that rock twice.
An' if I miss, dig in and try your best to slow the fall.
Fine, it shouldn't bother your conscience.
Mr. Travers is not the athletic type, he needs something more direct.
Yeah...
You gotta be kidding me!  Do you want me to fly up after you? Over.
Don't use my name!
Good, Travers.  It might catch on, like shooting skeet.
Sorry about the pain. Using the gulliver to much like, eh? Giving orders and disciplining and that perhaps, eh? You sure the pain's gone? You sure you'll not be happier back up in bed.
Very kind of you, sir. Thank you very much.
Yes, sir. I suppose you might call it that, sir.
Much better, thank you, sir.
Fine, sir, fine.
Thank you very much, sir.
What would you like to know, sir?
Not tonight - not this nochy.
It's this Health Farm. A bit out of the town. Isolated. It's owned by this like very rich ptitsa who lives there with her cats. The place is shut down for a week and she's completely on her own, and it's full up with like gold and silver and like jewels.
Hello, heap of dirt. Pooh, you don't wash much do you, judging by the horrible smell.
Oh, he had a shower this morning. You trying to call me a liar?
What do I want?
Oh. Oh, you're sorry are you, well you must think I'm awfully stupid. He slaps Alex in the face.
You want to know why I did that, well you see - I do that... He stamps on Alex's foot.
... and that... He pulls Alex's ear, pushes him off balance and plants his foot on his chest.
I'm gonna be sick.
I wanna be sick.
Let me get up.
... And again... Go on!!! Again! There's a good boy.
Good morning, Alex, my name is Dr. Branom. I'm Doctor Brodsky's assistant.
Indeed it is. May I take this She removes his tray.
Fine... fine.
I realise all that, Missus, and I'm very grateful to all concerned.
I hope so, Missus. She inserts a needle into the medicine vial.
Oh no, nothing of the sort.
Something like that. You are a little undernourished, so after each meal were going to give you a shot. Roll over on your right side please, loosen your pyjama pants and pull them half-way down. He does, somewhat reluctantly. She gives him a shot in the bum.
It's quite simple really. Were just going to show you some films.
Something like that.
If thou lose hope being weary in the days of distress, thy strength shall be diminished.
Father, I have tried, have I not?
I've done my best, have I not?
And, Father, I've never been guilty of any institutional infractions, have I?
Father - may I ask you a question in private?
No Father. It's nothing like that, Father. It's about this new thing they're all talking about. About this new treatment that you out of prison in no time at all and makes sure you never get back in again.
These things get around, Father. Two Warders talk as it might be, and somebody can't help overhearing what they say. Then somebody picks up a scrap of newspaper in the workshops and the newspaper tells all about it. How about putting me in for this new treatment, Father?
I don't know what it's called, Father, all I know is that it gets you out quickly and makes sure that you never get in again.
But it is being used, isn't it, Father?
I don't care about the danger, Father. I just want to be good. I want for the rest of my life to be one act of goodness.
I don't understand about the whys and wherefores, Father. I only know I want to be good.
Instruct thy son and he shall refresh thee and shall give delight to thy soul.
Pitiful rookerful...
Yeah... Pete the English.
Shall we go to my office?
No, no way, I couldn't take that...
...I was just a young cat back then, about nineteen, bussin' tables in this very place.  Didn't pay but shit, but that wasn't the point.  Being around the music, that was the thing.  And I was.  Take this one night...July 22, 1964...who walks in?  Mr. Louis Armstrong.
Right through those doors.  The man himself.
He'd come over from Queens to do the Ed Sullivan show.  After, he decides to come on up to Harlem and hang with the common folk.  That's how he was, you see.  Never forgot where he came from.  Money and fame an' all that?  Meant nothin', long as he could blow that horn.  So before you it, he's up on that stage, doin' his thing.
Like Winton Marsalis says, it was pure, spiritual essence.  Louis was playing.  God was smiling.
Tell me Vincent.  Tell me what you think.
Lemme tell you something.  Vincent and a few other guys like him are fucking ghosts.  Nobody even know what he looked like until now...
I was with Max when he got the call.
It's nothing.
You're kidding me.
Yeah?
He fell on my cab!  From up th-th-there.
Max.
Chopin prelude.  Stodgy, but nice.  Here's the deal.  I didn't want you involved in this.  Still breathing? But now that you are, we have to make the best of it, Max.  Improvise.  Life is that way.  Adapt to your environment.  Survive.  Darwin.  "Shit happens."  The I Ching.  Whatever. Roll with it.
I didn't throw him, he fell.
Nothing.  I only met him the one time.
I should only kill people after I get to know 'em?  Six billion people on the planet, you're getting bent out of shape 'cause of one fat guy?
What do you care?  Ever hear of Rwanda?
Lenny?  You're an asshole.
Show up for what?
How long have you been a hit man?
In case he asks.
You get benefits?
Paid sick leave?
Max?
What're you thinking, Jerry?
Tell you what.  Reminds me of life in the Delta.
Mekong, my friend, Mekong.
Sure.  And the two of 'em used my legs for a wishbone.  Nearly snapped me in half.
I bit the bastard's nose off.
Lucky guess... Um, I'd feel a lot less naked if we could get outta here.
So I'm a little jumpy.  Who wouldn't be?
You wouldn't be sitting here if you didn't halfway believe me.
Was that who I thought it was?
Has this happened to you before?
Who are you, Jerry?
You're wrong.  Since I met you, I don't dream about holes anymore.
Yesterday you were wondering about the wall.  How it was possible.
How do you really know there's gold in Fort Knox?  Just because they say so?  We should go to Tennessee and demand to see it.
Blue moon...
I love you, too.
So he thinks NASA is plotting to kill the President?
And you have no idea where he lives?
Here's a fresh one.  Why you? Your colleague Mr. Wilson says Jerry won't speak to anyone else. That seems oddly possessive behavior to me.
<u>Why you</u>?
A charming term.  Now, <u>why him</u>?
Jerry's visits to your office. Why do you tolerate them?  Why him?
Where'd you get it?
It was my father's.  Kept it in his wallet.  He was murdered --
Not a man.  Ezekiel Walters.
I've been given a cease and desist on all matters relating to Jerry Fletcher.  We're not to discuss him with the press, the N.Y.P.D., anyone.  Building police are to arrest him on sight and we're to report any attempt he makes to contact you.
It makes perfect sense.  Field work is not our oeuvre.
Dr. Jonas thought you might be inclined not to cooperate.  Why is that?
I've had a lot of credentials flashed in my face, Liza.  What I saw yesterday, I know not to ask questions.  We're out.  Shut off. Terminated.  <u>Understood</u>?
Do you believe me?
I want to believe you, too.
Dr. Arroway --
Mathematics is the only truly universal language, Senator.  We think this may be a beacon -- an announcement to get our attention.
... Two years is still a hell of a long time -- and as far as we can tell there aren't any provisions in the machine design for storing food, water, even air...
What...
You've only searched -- what is it, sixteen hundred stars without a peep?  Try not to take it too personally.
Please answer the question, Doctor.
Thank you, Doctor.  Now --
... life is unspeakably rare.  So whenever we do find another civilization, especially one that's... struggling... We send a message.  Sometimes we can offer help.  Sometimes we can't.  But we always try.  Life is simply too precious not to.
A sunrise and a sunset every forty- five minutes.
I read your paper on ETI's.  It's brilliant.
I agree with Mr. Rank that there are unavoidable religious implications here -- but I don't think it justifies taking an alarmist position.  Dr. Arroway is right -- their chosen means of communication was a scientific one, and a scientific approach is probably appropriate, at least until the theological dimensions of the problem become more apparent.
I read your book.
Losing Faith:  The Search For Meaning In the Age of Reason. Catchy.
I'm more interested in the story behind the story... How a young man goes from living on the streets of South Boston to being the best- selling media figure rubbing elbows with the President.
I thought it was well-written. Heart-felt.  And a little bit naive... But that's just the enemy's perspective.
Did you ever stop to think that maybe that isn't science's fault, but meaning's?
Hi.
I'm assuming you read my deposition.
You don't take another man's place, boy.
You think life is some kind of ocean voyage and you start out with buntin' and hollerin' and high hopes, but the damn ship goes down before you ever reach the other side. Luke?
What went wrong?
No.
Then how come it ain't done yet?
Here, Captain.
Cuttin' the heads off parkin' meters, Captain.
I guess you could say I wasn't thinkin', Captain.
That's right, Captain. Just passin' the time.
Newmeat looks like a poker player, Drag.
Lemme see it!
Course not. He ain't in the box 'cause a the joke played on him. He's there 'cause he back sassed a Free Man. They got their rules and we ain't got nothing to do with that. Woulda probably happened to him sooner or later, to a complainer like him. He's gotta learn the rules same as anybody else.
They don't know iff'n to smile, spit or swallow.
Dragline gives out the names here. You'll get yours when he figures you out.
A bunch. Must be halfa dozen Newmeat.
Back a buck.
I don't see no sign of guts in you.
You ain't man enough to wear them!
Big deal paper hanger! Hell, anyone who can write can pass fifty-sixty dollar checks. Like breakin' open a piggy bank.
Cellulite.  What do you say I blindfold you and take you to the gym.  Aerobics with housewives...
It's almost six.  And guess what? Hall likes me bathed and shaved.
The first two murders.
He told me he had done two others just like it.
When he was seventeen.
Hi.  It's your worst student, Peter Foley -- how do you grade me now, Doctor?
You like that action?  Didn't that cop on TV look <u>solemn</u>?  The guy in the basement doesn't matter, anyway, just another lonely heart.
I want to tell you it's a great honor to meet you and talk to you.
<u>You</u> called <u>us</u>, Doctor Hudson.
She probably let him in the door without a thought.  Where are their mothers?!  Where are the mothers that are supposed to teach them to be wary and to tough and not afraid to fight?
Helen, hang up, let Ruben get on with his work...
I am not going to talk about it. How do you <u>know</u> it was Andy if the head was gone?  Where is the head? Are you looking for it?  Oh, God, why him?  Because of me.  I can't talk about it.  I write about things like this, stuff it all in books and bury it in libraries. This is the first person close to me who's ever died.  And it's because of me.  This monster killed him because I loved him.
I know 'Halloran.'  What's the rest of it?
Yes.
They all have one...
Whatever it is, I'm gonna find out and sooner is a hell of lot better than later.
Who came in after you?
You're good enough you'll never have to kill anyone.  I joined the cops to save lives, not waste them.
Ruben, my God, I ought to put you on report.
We're gonna have a bunch of clapped out old hippies blissing on the Grateful Dead!  Sleeping in the park, smoking dope and sticking tulips up their ass.
The prowler in Hudson's apartment turns out to have a meeting with a suspect...
How'd you get in on the deal?
You have no authority to make a deal like that.  That' s for the D.A...
Saks.  If he knew you did that! They're all asking me, 'what is she doing,' as it is.
See, now you've annoyed her.  You know she doesn't like you to touch me.  Does she, widdle wee fing!  Wuhve you so much!  Did you feed her?
She doesn't lie!  You sure you fed her?
Renata tells me you're going to rent a car.
How can you drive? James... your legs. You can Barely walk.
I've never really noticed. Is Renata going with you?
I'm amazed that she'll let you drive her.
You haven't told me where we're going.
What is it?
Really? What kind of exhibition is it?
You're kidding.
Hello, Letitia. I'm Dr. Emlee, and I have some questions to ask you...
But what I really can't believe is that I'm starting to actually miss work.
I thought about calling, but I want to wait until I know when I'll be out.
What?
You know what, Ruthie? I better get back to my class, OK?
What's all the dreck?
It'll be fine.
How wonderful, darling.  What does that mean for you?
Will you get time off to do that?
I'll see you soon.
Honestly, Letty.
Do you mind if I call you Letitia?
First off, Letty, can you tell me where you are?
But you're checking it out.
A daisy for the lady.
John and Nurse Gates are waiting for you.
It's TV heaven.
Sounds good. Oh, and Letty?
Hey, Letty. Mrs. Mayer.
I guess we need to talk.
I guess I should go now.
But what about that math project?
Forget I asked.
Maybe you ought to see a doctor.
No, you've done a perfect job.
The Superintendent was just getting ready to leave.
You want the tapes for yourself.     You're going to sell them.
You didn't have to kill Sophie.
What about me? Aren't I a loose end?
Yes. We went to the address we were given and had to tie up the owner of the house who turns out to be some Mafia guy.
Oui.
No.
Oui.
I understand Bobby Beans came to see you today.
And?
He's trying to get a foot hold in our territory.
Business must be good if he can afford to buy up useless property.
This plane will take you to Canada. From there you can fly back to Paris.
Get that, will you?
Because you're the closest.
Cut his pants up the leg to the groin.
Fuck you! You know I'd never go along with something like this.
What's the big deal? It's not like I was on guard duty or something.
What?
Hey, who warned you that they were coming up to the room?
No, that would have left me with nothing because all of you would be dead.
Does it really matter what I say?
I will.
What'd I tell you? Huh, Vinny? What'd I tell you when you came to me for money? Didn't I ask you not to do it? Did I not say that?  What'd I say to him?
They don't have a wine list.
Maybe I'm missing the obvious, but why aren't we leaving town? Any place has to be safer for us than Chicago.
Going somewhere?
How's my brother?
He speaks about himself in the third person?
Algeria.
Well, you know, not all Algerians speak French. It's a matter of what school you went too. Me I never really --
You like shoes?
Jesus, Frankie, I'm your brother!
Do you think you are a real master?
Stop talking like a monk!  Just fight!
On guard!
I'm tired now.
It will be just the same.  Enough! I'm tired.
Here you must be in proper attire.
I'll give them to you.
You shouldn't have come.
Go.
You think Jade Fox will show up?
Maybe the murderer and the thief are one and the same.
And you're gonna tell me who.
And I say I'm dead... and I move.
I mean, I've done what I came to do.  It shouldn't hurt this much. But it will pass...
My mom works over there.  I'm waiting for her, but she's probably with him, right now.
Mister Funboy.
Chili dog for breakfast... it's original.
Who gives a fuck!  I'm a businessman.  You gonna do me, then do me and shut you're face!
I never forget anything, dickhead. That building was a sweep-and- clear; the bitch was a nuisance with her goddamned petition.  It got a little rowdy... end of story.
No, wait, no WAIT, that's too much, man, that's like overkill, nobody can take that much, you're wasting it -- !
Blow yourself, bigmouth.
I've got him if you want him.
Annette, how long have we known each other?
About what?
I never said that.
Look, I didn't mean to give you a hard time.
Thank you.
Shut up.
Look, I'm flattered but, seriously it could never work.
Well, I was just calling to tell you I was thinking about you and I miss you. I'll let you go.
Okay?
You know what? I don't take it back.
Because I'm in love with you.
I can't handle it. I can't keep my feelings bottled up like you. Can you honestly tell me that you feel nothing for me? ... Tell me!
Then what's wrong? I love you Annette. It's not like you have a husband, unless your married to Jesus.
It's not you, it's me. I'm completely fucked up.
Why aren't you understanding?
Where did you find those?
Those are my letters!
Who is it?
I'm sorry that was out of line.
I was just kidding.
Jesus. We've been at this for six months.
And you haven't made an ounce of progress.
Greg, is that you under the covers?
What's wrong?
What do you mean?
Jesus Christ, is she for real?
B.F.D. What do you plan to do? Fly to Kansas and woo little Dorothy.
You don't stand a chance. Even this is out of your league.
I'll think about it...
I hate when things don't go my way. It makes me so horny.
If your asking if I nailed her the answer is no.
Exactly the opposite.
I don't know. She was lying on the bed, ready to do it, but I-- I don't, I was... I just didn't feel right about it.
Devastated beyond repair. I doubt she'll ever trust a man again.
Don't worry, it's totally understandable. Most of the boys that matriculate at Oakwood are very upstanding gentleman, however there are the occasional bad apples.
I'll do that.
to a situation) Really, Mr. Reed, there isn't anything to worry about. It was only a slap --
You get your wish!
Oh, thank you, darling.
Did you hear the child out?
You mean you didn't. It seems to me the least you could do. You can't just jump at conclusions that way. You're being unfair.
You're shouting at me.
Hello, Amy.
No, darling, I hadn't intended to.
I'm sorry. Daddy and Mommy are a little upset.
What'd you get for Christmas?
My goodness, don't you open your presents until Christmas morning?
We open ours on Christmas Eve. That's considered proper.
So beautiful, Irena. So beautiful.
It stands so still.
I can sea its breath in the cold.
May I pet the deer?
You're going to be busy all day long, Edward.
I like stories.
Mommy read it to ne.
My daughter, Barbara, died when she was six. That was long ago. You're only the woman who keeps care of me. I know you.
On the dark nights  on the stormy nights -- you can hear him. He passes like the wind; The flapping and fluttering of his great cloak beating like gaunt wings. The thunder of his horse's hooves is loud, loud and louder, beating hard, beating strong on the frozen ground as he comes riding, riding, riding.
Amy looks happy  seems almost as if she were playing with another child; like somebody else were running with her and playing.
No way is that the same chick. The other one was a dog.
How's the rest of your health?
Or if there's a full moon.
I thought you were going to stop wearing your glasses.
Charming Carlton.
You're delusional. Maybe you had a bad dream and bit your lip -- so you tasted blood. And the severed arm... well I don't see it and... maybe this is all in your head.
Maybe the blood was from your period like before.
Frida, listen to yourself. If I said I was a werewolf, would you believe me?
Peter knows something.
You're kidding, really?
OUCH that stings! Damn, what am I going to do with my back like this?
Frida, you know you're it for me.
I can't read any more crap. These women are all victims.
I think we should do something with strong female characters...
I've read scripts about detectives, but never met one. Must be wild.
Like what?
A lot of people don't wear underwear.
Everything okay?
Is it that funny?
Is that how you feel?
You didn't say it.
Be careful!
No. It doesn't work that way. Men can't get PMS. Unfortunately.
A kiss? Did you have sex with him?
It's for you. Frida.
I didn't trust her. All that blood on the sheets. She may look sweet, but she could be a wolf in sheep's clothing. Something's weird.
Hell no, I'm not into that shit. The sight of blood makes me sick.
No man. Blood is not a turn on. You sure let that Frida off the hook. You weren't even going to take the sheets. If I didn't know better, I'd think you liked her.
Spencer's the key here. Frida is in no way associated with him. And her blood hasn't matched with any of the killings.
It's like some fucking monster dropped out of the sky and killed these dudes.
All the same entry wounds.  It's definitely him.  She lives...  lived here.  A prostitute.
His wife.
Was that for real down there?
Dammit!
Dont ever sneak up on me like that! Who are you?
People...  after me.
I don't know who they are.
Don't know that either.
Such a joker!  Like your father.
What does she say?  The woman.
Your name is John White.
What are you doing?
You understand what you'll be doing?
Wave from the door... go down the stairs... get into the limo...
Don't say a .
I'm not certain about...
What do you think you're doing?!
Look, everything can be handled.  We'll just find a way to handle it.
Well, start by going on television and saying that he's had a mild stroke...
Yes - - and that he ought to be up and around sometime soon.
Uh, let me get back to you...
It's a homeless shelter.
It's gonna be great.  'Caring about his wife.'  'Spending time on her favorite issue...'
So you want to go swimming?
Oh yeah... Me, too.  You want to get dinner later?
It's actually kind of serious, Dave. I'm afraid the President's not in very good shape.
Fine.
This is from the people of Burundi...
Your government needs your help.
Who?
... How could I what?
Just souvenirs.  Towels and stuff.
That's a secret.
Hi.
) Thought I needed a little change.  You like it?
Please...senor...destroy me...one bullet...please.
Are you alright, Doc? You look... you look real bad.
The man I was with...until today... believed that praying was for blind men who couldn't see the truth.
Curse?
It's a disease. It's a...a bug...a parasite that infects the brain.
We thought we were escaping here. We thought we'd found an uninhabited island. Christ! This place is a worse nightmare than anything I've seen yet!
Oh, what did I run into? A bunch o' Jesus nuts? Religiosos? Prayer won't stop a bullet from one of those storm troopers and prayer won't keep one of those monsters from eatin' your liver for lunch.
Look. I BEEN fightin', mister. I been fightin' for what feels like a hundred years and I'm finished. I don't need religion. I don't need prayers. I need a couple guns and a couple hands. We can sail on outa here. Find another island where there ain't so much....traffic.
What'dya tell that soldier, soldier? You tell him we was rebels?
TONY....TONY....
Toby...thank God...wait here. I gotta find out what's goin' on.
Some of Rhodes' men. At the door.
It's because of me.
I want you to leave. Then maybe...
I am not...a guerilla fighter, Toby. I'm not a pioneer. I'm not...I'm not strong that way. I need...
I can work here. Maybe my work can help...help everyone. I can do more good with access to this equipment than I can off in some wasteland.
Well, I'd better find Patsy.  Say hello to Mutt for me.
I feel like I've never been alive.  For years I've been risking nothing.  I have no idea what I am or what I want to do! Neil, you know you want to act.  Knox wants Chris.
Well...
It's such a strange name!  Won't you tell us what it means?
Who else was involved in this?
Charlie...
Nuwanda, what is going on?
Oh Chet, that feels fabulous,
carpe breastum.  Seize the breast.
Gather ye rosebuds while ye may.  The Latin term for that sentiment is "Carpe Diem." Anyone know what that means?
Very good, Mr._?
Come on boys, don't be shy.
All right!  What'd she say?
If you have built castles in the air, your work need not be lost.  That is where they should be.  Now put foundations under them.
Look at this.
By the way, there's a meeting this afternoon.  You coming?
You the Captain?
How do we get out of here?
Right here...middle of nowhere...
Now, where's Mulligan? Where's Vivo?
Hey! Hey! Where are you going?
So how do you get from the Bronx to the South China sea?
Where's you friend?
I think he knows that Joey.
You know what I think? I think our luck has just about run shit out...
I think we gotta stop floating from one fucked up situation to the next...
You know what my goal is? Before I die I want to make love to a woman from every country on earth.
What the hell does that mean?
She fucked you?
She fucked me too.
Damn right!
Tell him, Vince!
Fucking A.
Wait! First I give you special fuck!
'Course how could you miss, right? Twenty, maybe thirty feet. I mean, if I'd'a been where you guys were --
I don't know what we've been waiting for!
Yeah... All the guys, we're all going huntin'. Like we did. You know? Like we always used to.
Humper's ready. Old humper's hotter'n damn hell!
It's ahead, by the tree.
You're one fuckin' bastard, Merle. You know that? You're one fucking bastard!
It's Merle, Sal.
I saw him last night. I thought I was dreaming. I thought I was out of my mind.
Yeah.
What the hell was that!  What did you think? Did you think it was loaded!
The fuck I did!!!
Mr. Murphy asked about you again at work yesterday.
I think he wants more than your cookies.
I'm not on the force anymore.
I want to see my wife and kid.
I told you.  I'm out of the cops and robbers business.  Retired twenty years ago.  I've been trained as a bus driver.  Got a whole route planned and everything.  Even nailed down the lingo - '<u>Exact change, please</u>'.
I want to stop aging.
Doucet's just offed two of the jurors who put him away.  I'm rounding up the rest of them and putting them in police custody.  What's your status?
Sir---
I'll inform dispatch.
We don't know that for sure.  We'll have to wait until they move.
You're saying you were put away for a crime you didn't commit?
It doesn't make sense.  Who would want to do that to you?
Part of Doucet's cerebellum, a portion called the vermis is under- developed.  This area rates response to outside stimuli.  Com- pare it to that of a normal law- abiding citizen.  It could be why he kills.
I'm just doing it by the book. Analyze then vaporize.  Crime's a science.  Everything's analyzed.
What are you doing this for, Sanchez?
Bye.  Thanks.
Hey, you! Watch out there -- you're scuffing my Brussels carpet -- Consarn them.
Make them go faster, Mr.... ?
Golly -- I'd like to see all your horses!
What's that, sir?
Anybody can see that.
But it didn't stop. I know it didn't stop. Granny told me it didn't.
Sure does. But I'll have to sleep on it a couple of nights.
Now run along, Daniel.
Almost seven.  No -- no, he's not seven yet I am sure --
Are they all as -- small -- as that?
Well -- Mr. Webster! This is a great day for me. Come on in, sir. I want you to take the seat of honor and meet all my guests!
What -- what's on your mind?
Contracts? -- Yes, they have contracts with me -- lots of 'em -- but -- but that's all right. Without me and my money, they wouldn't have anything.
Mighty good of you to come out, Squire -- sparing all this time to --  Sheriff, too -- and Schoolmaster -- mighty nice.
I think his leg is broken.
It feels fine now, Jabez.
Jabez -- once you said we'd never change --
You must go now, Mary -- you must!
It won't be the first baby ever born in this house.  There! Made me drop a stitch!  Sit down, you make me nervous!  Lan's, that's the way a man always is. Thinks his son's the most important thing in the world.
Yep -- you can't get around that mortgage. -- I'm sorry, Jabez.
Wish I could really do something for you. But you know Stevens. He'll throw you off your farm tomorrow if you don't pay him tonight.
What a nice -- and kind girl --  Who is she --?
Jabez ...
Mr. Webster -- you will help him?
I wanted to give it all to the church.
That isn't it. It's ... the loneliness, Mr. Scratch ... the loneliness!
I want someone to talk to ...
No, no ...  I want to talk to men ... to people in Cross Corners ...to my neighbors ...
I can't be honest with them.
I'm Special Agent Johnson of the FBI. This is Agent Johnson...no relation.
You're very perceptive.
You're amazing.  You figured this all out already?
I must have missed 60 Minutes.  What are you saying?
The code key, please...?
Hans.  Your Hans.
That was tricky, with the accent. I bet you do a great Ed Sullivan. Why do you need the detonators, Hans? I already used the explosives.
Go on.
No.  But I'll have a sofa brought out to you.  Good enough?
Excuse me, I'm looking for --
Yeah.  How'd you know?
Two.  And I'd sure like to see them swinging on the jungle gym with Al junior.
What's going on?
Going in...are you out of your mind? There's 30 hostages in there -- for all we know --
What about the body that fell out of the window -- ?
Aw, hey...
Jesus Christ is coming back and he's really pissed.
Let Sal come out, take a look. What hope you got?  Quit while you're ahead.  All you got is attempted robbery.
We're all set at Kennedy.
He's totally unstable.  He'll make a mistake.
The gun's right on your back...
What?
Mister Mulvaney?
Are you a lawyer?
How did you know your son was involved?
When was the last time you saw Sal?
Did you know he was a homosexual?
Did you always call him Junior.
Do you remember anything else about Sal?
Sal, I'm sorry about this.  But we can get outta this thing.  There's a way outta this.
Well, I stalled him for a while. When it comes the time, then we'll work it out.  Okay?
I want him to think that.
We won't have to.
Sal?
Nobody give their right name ... it's the FBI!
Listen, we got young girls here... you could watch your language.
What do you want here, Ma?  You could of watched it on TV.
Mom - I got it all worked out; it's over.  The best thing is you go home.  Watch it on TV.
You did what?  Who did you talk to? What for?
Oh my God, mother!
Don't talk to them anymore.  Sal and me are getting a jet, we're going to Algeria - I'll write you from there.
We can't stay here.
Morning.
Fella could get used to a life this ordinary.
Okay.
<i>The driver's name was Locus Fender. We know that he was in on the heist.</i> <b> INT. ARMORED CAR -- NEXT </b> LOCUS FENDER  is behind the wheel of the armored car. His unshaven, disheveled appearance looks totally out of place in his security uniform. <b> INT. VEGAS SECURITY LOCKDOWN -- NIGHT </b> Taryn is now scrawling notes on a pad.
I don't know.
Is that you, Domino?
Don't fuck with us, Edna! There are at least three more limbs where that one came from!
<i>I was asleep in mum's guest house.</i> <b> INT. SOPHIE THOMAS MANSION -- BEDROOM -- NEXT </b> Domino is asleep in bed. The TELEPHONE rings.
We're late.
You were good.
What do you want to live in a Black neighborhood for?  Motherfuck gentrification.
Why it gotta be about jungle music and Africa?
No!
Doctor, this is Da Mayor talkin'.
Doctor, always try to do the right thing.
Stop trying to play big brother. I'm a grown woman.  You gotta lotta nerve.  Mookie, you can hardly pay your rent and you're gonna tell me what to do.  Come off it.
Oh, it doesn't, huh!  You got your little 250 dollars a week plus tips...
...peanuts.
WAKE UP!
ML stands for ML.  That's it.
Sal, if you want me to deliver any faster, get me a jet rocket or something, cuz I can't run with pizzas, all the cheese ends up on one side and shit.
I'm not guilty of nuthin'.
C'mon, Sal.
And I really wanted some ice cream too.
No!  No!  You won't come back either.
How long then?
That's out.  No!  It's too hot! You think I'm gonna let you get some, put on your clothes, then run outta here and never see you again in who knows when?
You a blue-moon fool.
What else?
Trust you?  Because of trusting you we have a son.  Remember your son?
Shaddup, Vito.
Mister Seor Love Daddy is cool.
Yeah.
I don't know.
That's what you think?
Fuck you and stay off the phone.
Sal's Famous Pizzeria, yeah, two large pizzas, pepperoni and anchovies, hold on...  See, Pop, Mookie fucking talking on the phone and people are trying to call in orders.  He's making us lose business.
Both of youse--shaddup.  This is a place of business.
I don't get it. Why'd you make him a pirate?
What? Well now I'm in a position where I may just heed your help.
Just down the hall.
Wow, a treasure map! What's the treasure?
Wow just like Marco Polo.
God, she's beautiful. My wiener's all tingly.
Oh, yeah. Well I almost always beat Captain Rob.
Just a guy I hang out with.
No! Captain Rob is seven feet tall, wears an eye patch, got a hook for a hand...
What? No no. He's got a parrot on his shoulder, buries treasure...
I don't think so. This guy drinks rum from a barrel, says "yo ho ho" has a peg leg...
Yeah, go-cart accident.
If he heard you talking like that he'd make you walk the plank.  Three, two, one. Now it's your turn, spin.
Can he do that?
Nope. I was right.
Don't snap at me like that. You're lucky I don't punch you right in the face.
Wow, we built a whole float in one afternoon. And now the reward.
You know Lloyd, the real treasure is our friendship.
But my mom gave me the map.
I made the polar bear pants.
I... found that rock.
Wait, wait!
She's one of a kind.
I'm going to ask you one last time and if I don't get an answer, I don't even want to think about the consequences which would be frightening to say the least. Where's my chest, Jessica?
What?
HARRY and I have been talking about school. In fact, I want to ask you something.
Don't worry about me, I'll be fine. I can take care of myself and I'm getting the story every high school reporter dreams of.
Mrs. D! I was hoping you'd show up.
Have you got what I want?
Looking for a scoop, huh? I'll give you a scoop... of short bus.  Lose her!
What?
You know honey, I've finally figured out a way of bilking enough money from the school to get us that condo in Waikiki.
Baby, I'm going to spend the morning at the mall. You know, shop for Waikiki. Honey, what are you looking for?
What papers?
The evidence of what?
I understand we have you to thank for these stillsuits, Doctor.
I can assure you...
Gurney... I see Thufir Hawat among the captives.  Let him stand free.
Remove her gag!
Stop him yourself.
We surprised a band of smugglers.
Don't try your powers on me.  Try looking into that place where you dare not look. You'll find me there staring back at you!! You Bene Gesserit have waited ninety generations to produce the one person your schemes required.  Here I stand.  But... I will never be yours.
Bring me two more Beefeater martinis. Eddie will have another whiskey, Dagmar's a Rum-and-coke, Moustapha and King are chablis -- hey Bela, would you like a wine?
They don't want the classic horror films anymore.  Today, it's all giant bugs, giant spiders, giant grasshoppers -- who would believe such nonsense!
They were <u>mythic</u>.  They had a poetry to them.  And you know what else?  The women prefer the traditional monsters.
The pure horror, it both repels and attracts them.  Because in their collective unconsciousness, they have the agony of childbirth.  The blood. The blood is horror.
You're right, Bela.  Now Dracula, <u>that's</u> a part that takes acting.
"Greetings.  I am the Count."
"It is my home."
In life, the decisions that haunt you are the ones where you just don't know... where right or wrong will never be answered.  Years ago, the Hungarians contacted me.  The government wanted me to come home, to be Minister of Culture.
It was a very impressive offer. Fancy offices, a big home... I'd be treated like a king.
I didn't know if it was a trick. They might arrest me and throw me in a gulag.  I am Hungary's most famous emigrant. they'd use me as a lesson to anyone who tries to leave.
What are you doing?
Jesus Christ, what an evening.  What happened?
Don't you have any savings?
Last night was quite a romp.
I envied him.  Hell, I envied you too, having a girlfriend that would jump in front of a car like that.
Hey Ed, shouldn't we do another take? Big Baldy kinda got stuck in the doorway.
Incidentally, you <u>promise</u> you're not going to scratch my car...?
How long have you been doing this?
Jesus Christ!  And you never told me?
It was the only way I could get the movie made!
I'm sorry!  What did you want me to say?
But there's plenty of other parts.
Perhaps you'd like to look at the photoplay.
Oh, of course!!  There's a couple characters you'd be perfect for: The secretary at the newspaper office, or the file clerk!
Well... I've got another project I wasn't gonna tell you about. Lugosi's in it, but he's got a smaller part.  The lead is an ingenue, a sterling young actress named Dolores Fuller.  The title is "Bride Of The Atom."
Mr. Reynolds!
I'd be happy too, if I had such a great family.
It opens in nine weeks in Tulsa.
I think it's fifty-seven minutes long.
Ed, what was the one thing I asked you to do?  Make it <u>seven reels long</u>. I've got contracts with my exhibitors.  If it ain't over an hour, they won't play it.
They'll notice.  Look, why don't you let me take over from here?  I can do a few tricks: Pad it out with more stock footage, add establishing shots...
Good.  And one more thing.  I think your "Written, Directed, and Starring Ed Wood" credit is a bad idea.
Oh.  I loved those shows!  "Inner Sanctum"... "The Shadow" --
Those assholes.
Look... would it be possible to make the "Ghoul's Wife" a little less prominent, so people won't really notice me in the movie?
Norma, this is Bela -- Bela, this is Norma.  Norma, this is Tor -- Tor, this is Norma.  Norma, this is Paul Paul, this is Norma.
My goodness, you're embarrassing me.
What do you love her or something?
Yeah only I wish they had the sister on more.
Ed, everything goes off. "Cheers" went off. "Mash" went off --
Ed --
Ed --
You know who we are?
We're the guys who clean up after the parade.
I was at this comedy club last week and this comedian says "If you're over thirty and your job requires you to wear a name tag, you screwed up your life." And I'm laughing and then I realize I wear a nametag.
I told you the facts! He abandoned us -- those are the facts.
Ed! How did you know I was here?
Why shouldn't I be in a place like this? I'm a whore!
I'm a tramp  Meet your new father. The whole nation is laughing at us!
Oh! Oh -- okay, now I get it. It's "Star Search." You wanted me here because the camera comes with me.
Don't defend that horse's ass to me.
Ha!
I've got news for you-- I never intended to marry him.
Um...
This is going right up your ass.
You would do this? You would actually --
Why do you do that?
Whenever you ask me something why do you always say "Let me ask you something?" Why don't you just ask me?
I'm doing all right.
Who is it?
Come on, Ma.
You know what your problem is?
I got paid by the word! No! Your problem is you don't ever want anything to be your fault.
-- That we were doing "together." I finished it. It came out great! Because no one was standing over my shoulder bothering me - "That's too much glue. You're using too much glue."
Ohhh...
Ohh... do you own a cat?
Sherry   Sherry  Sheerrry. ...
Don't you smartass me!  Don't you dare smartass me!  You just shut your mouth I  Now your mother and I have had a long talk with Halt Hendricks  --- we just got off the phone with him at home. You know, he doesn't want you back at Millard.  He's fed up with you.  Fed up!  And I don't blame him!
What?
Good morning, Mr. McAllister.
You know what they say about the early bird.
You're the advisor.  You should stop her.  She's not qualified.  She's just a sophomore.
Are you sure all her signatures are real?  It's not easy to get all those signatures.
Hello, Mr. M.
What a surprise.
Could you get this? I can't
Fine.  Let's say all you ever knew was apples.  Apples, apples and more apples. You might think apples were pretty good, even if you occasionally got a rotten one. Then one day there's an orange. And now you can make a decision. Do you want an apple, or do you want an orange? That's democracy.
Uhhh... teeth. Teeth.
Yes, Paul?
Can I get you a drink?
I want to know about Exley.
You know him?
Where are we going?
You expecting problems?
Where's the other guy?  Buzz.
Whose shoe?
If she was sitting here, then it's facing the wrong way.  What are these smears in the blood?
But she's moving away from the door.  Who was sitting at this table?
You look like Robinson after that last LaMotta fight.  'Course LaMotta looked a lot worse.  So you're twenty-two, right?
Just getting my facts straight. Twenty-two makes it a gas chamber bounce. You should have pulled this caper a couple of years ago.  Get life, do a little Youth Authority jolt, transfer to Folsom a big man. Orbit on some of that good prison brew, get yourself a sissy --
That fucking Larry.  I almost believed him.
Nothing, Ray.  That Larry, he's a pisser.  You did the Casitas Youth Camp with him, didn't you?
That was his favorite toast.  I saw the test results on the lieutenant's exam.  You placed first out of twenty-three.
You'll make lieutenant inside a year.  Patrol division?
No... Where'd the tip come from?
Damnit...
Glasses.
What are you going to do?
How was I?
You sound like you mean it.
How about White?
It seems like my Susan, but...
You're back, boychick.
Fleaur-de-Lis.  'Whatever you desire.'
Um...who's that?
Someone else?
Why don't you just call Brill directly.
I'm told you had an affair with Rachel Banks four years ago.
Considering the enormous exposure to which you've subjected this firm, I'd think you'd do best to simply answer my questions.
Yes.
The NSA's been in bed with the entire tele-communications industry since the 40's. They've infected everything: Banks, computers, phones, mail, name it.  The more technology we buy into, the easier it is keeping tabs on us. It's a brave new world.  At least it better be.
None of your business.
These guys are incredibly persistent.
He came in four minutes ago.
I think she'll like this very much.
For that matter, I think you will too.
I don't understand why Jerry couldn't clear this up.
He's got his priorities?
Are you sure you're safe?
And then what?
Any idea what he looks like?
Robert--
How long can you stay?
Was Zavitz in trouble?
I sit on top of the greatest intelligence gathering organization in human history. Why can't I bring in a man whose name <i>is in the</i> <i><u>fucking</i></u> <i><u>phonebook</i></u>?!
He's clever? He had help?  Oh.
No, no, I'm sorry. I didn't realize you were hoping to be transferred to a weathership outside Greenland.
Thank you.
You should come into the shelter.
When were you most happy?
When were you least happy?
Okay.  And what do you love? Say everything.
I just know - any minute he'll find out, we'll barge into somebody we'll - and it will ill him.
Do you promise?  I wouldn't want to die here.  I wouldn't want to die in the desert. I've always had a rather elaborate funeral in mind, with particular hymns.  Very English.  And I know exactly where I want to be buried.  In our garden.  Where I grew up. With a view of the sea.  So promise me you'll come back for you.
What did you think you were doing in his tent?
You shouldn't go into another man's tent. It's inexcusable.
What did you do?
I was talking about the girl.
How are you?
Your leg will be fine.  A lot of shrapnel came out - I saved you the pieces.
Supper. Hana calls after him.
I think anybody she ever loves tends to die on her.
Me?  You've got the wrong end of the stick, old boy.  So - Caravaggio - Hana thinks you invented your name.
I told her you would never invent such a preposterous name.
You get to the morning and the poison leaks away, doesn't it? Black nights, fucking black nights, when you want to howl like a dog. I thought I would kill you.  You killed my friends, you ruined my hands.  But the girl was always here, like some Guardian Angel.
And a special thank you to Geoffrey and Katharine, without whose fund raising heroics we should still be kicking our heels. They toast the Cliftons.
Did Katharine say? - Geoffrey has to fly back to Cairo.
Excuse me -
Can I ask - my friend, can he come in? Just for a few minutes?
He's going back to the front this evening.  I can't see him otherwise.
No, I can't go, but if it, if you weren't offended, it would be very good of you to allow us - every other cabin is crammed. This is as private as we'll get.
You like him, don't you?  Your voice changes.
For my hair?
This is hot!
I was looking for the Lieutenant Singh.
Only we have to go to work.
A bomb.  At the Viaduct. She closes the door, then reappears.
Pardon me?
Darling, Peter says I could stay
Where were you? I called at 4:30 this morning.
We've got to catch him in the act.
It's not the thinking of it, it's the doing it.
Believe me, if you weren't so tiresome, I'd have one for you.
You're shaking. Are you nervous?
Very nice.
What the hell was that?
Nothing? You don't even lock the door?
You don't have any idea how lucky you are!
Did I hear a car?
Won't take any time.
Don't turn. I'm counting the steps to the entrance.
You can't be too careful.
STOP! You're making...mistake.
The big job.
I'll need the Rembrandt now.
Peoples China Bank.
No way to take another day or two?
And when, eventually, everyone discovers what transaction XJ6 was really about...
Put this on!
I'd give you a hand but it wouldn't look good.
Oh, look at me, darling. I thought this gentleman was a waiter.
See you.
Tequila.  From your drug dealer friend.
This is a real nice place you got here.
You wouldn't happen to have a little time right now, would you, Donna?
You never called me back.  I left messages.
Come on, I'm trying to help here.
Mr. Masry, Mario gets lost going to the bathroom.  They'll be driving around the valley for hours.
What now?
I like this case.
Me too.  That's why I like it.  It's been a long time since I had a case I cared about.
What kind of things come up?
Whoa.  No shit.
So what are you thinking?
... but it won't cover Annabelle Daniels's medical bills.
Do you think we'd do better by going to trial?
Plus, 40 percent of 20 million's a whole lot of money.
Don't give me that.  You've gotten plenty. You've been well-paid; you've gotten lots of perks ...
When'd they file the demur?
Pattee?  That your middle name?
You're married.
What are you <u>doing</u>?  Where's George?
Randy's mom said yes right away.
Ooh, now, see, if I'da known there was a beautiful woman next door, I'da done this different.  Let's start over.  My name's George.  What's yours?
You think it could make you sick, living in a place like this?
I'm so tired I'm about to drive off the road.  Keep me awake, willya?
No, no jokes, I gotta pee.  Just tell me about your day.  What went on back there?
What?  Beth?  My Beth?
Thank you.
I'm embarrassed.
It's just -- the pain.  It's only getting worse.  I can't be a good wife.  I can't be a good mother.
I know.  It's an awful lot.
It was .... the Emperor ....
Yes, he commands you make contact with him ....
Yes, My Lord.
Told you, I did.  Reckless is he ... Now things are going to worse.
Howls.
Barks his consternation.
Commander Skywalker hasn't come through the south entrance, sir. Maybe he slipped by without checking in.
We haven't got them adapted to this cold yet ...
The temperature is dropping too fast.
Sir, I was wondering ...
Now all we've got to worry about is what attacked him.
That was no laser blast .... some- thing hit us ....
Sure.  I guess I make it difficult sometimes.
Couldn't be, I checked the transfer circuits, just like you said!  I tell you this time it's not my fault.  I'm sure I checked it.
He found him in a junk pile ...
Well, I do trust him.  Lando's an old friend.  Must have been an accident.
That won't be easy, my friend ... What brings you here, anyway?
I'll take what's mine now.
That wasn't the bargain.  You said the Empire wouldn't interfere in--
Very noble.  Not smart, but noble.
Sure I did ... once.  It turned out lousy.
The speeders should be ready in the morning.  They'll make the search easier.
Rather touchy, aren't they.
I have followed my feelings.
I feel cold.
What's in there?
There is no escape.  You must join me or die.  Don't make me destroy you here ... The Emperor is strong with The Force.  But if you join me, together we could overthrow Him.  Do not resist. It is our destiny!
Zira, are you mad?
ComStat did a psychosearch on him. Used a database of 5 million sociopathic personalities. He hit the bottom of the curve.
Come on, Cuervo. I delivered him, didn't I? All I'm asking for is what you promised.
I need a favor.
Shut up, Plissken.
Top secret. Only on a need to know.
That's right, big shot. Unless you do what we want you're not coming back.
That's the deal.
Got a smoke?
Where is it?
What're you doing in here?
Good. I want you out. This is my sewer.
How do we get out of here?
You owe me. You left me holdin' everything back there in Cleveland.
Fight me from your horse or on foot, but fight me. Your avoidance mocks me.
Arthur.
It is whispered in the forest that...  ...Leondegrance's castle is under siege by Lot and Uryens.
Well there. You don't need me half as much as you think you do. You already know what must not happen.
The knights of Galys approach the camp. It would be politic...
Father...
I have come to claim what is mine, Father.
No, I think it's better if you just stay here to heal. At least a week.
There are things about love--
When Arthur built the castle, I carved out a place for myself, where I could laugh or sleep, and no one would bother me.
I have walked my way since the beginning of time. Sometimes I give, sometimes I take. It is mine to know which, and when.
Quite frankly, we don't know much about it except that it's starts with some conflict or guilt that eventually leads to the patient's delusion that his body's been invaded by an alien intellegence; a spirit if you will.
It's-
I'm sorry.
Where do you want this?
Phonograph.
Good morning Madame.
Rats?
Is it coming out Willie?
Oh, I'm very sorry Father. Hi.
Yes. He's already here.
Captain Howdy, Do you think my mom's pretty? Captain Howdy? Captain Howdy that isn't very nice.
All done.
Lieutenant?
You just missed them.
She seemed fine.
What's that?
Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day, our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation.
Why this girl it makes no sense?
Almighty Lord, word of God the father Jesus Christ, God and Lord of all creation, who gave to your holy apostle the power to tramp underfoot serpents and scorpions. Grant me, your unworthy servant pardon for all my sins...
What're you saying, Charlie?
Twelve years.
So?
Vacation?  Christ, Charlie, it's a Monday night. You said so yourself.
Knee.  Tore it up against St. Anthony's.  Right before the accident.
Tag 'em, Willie.  The Regency downtown, Thursday-Friday.  Thanks.
Listen ... why don't you come out to the house this weekend.  Say hello to the kids. They've grown.
You're their uncle.
They don't.  They're always asking about you.
It was an accident.
Cindy.
She didn't know what she was doing. You're too sensitive.
Yeah?
Frank?
I've had enough family for one month, Frank.
So talk to me tomorrow.  After the gig.
What're you talking about?
Jack.
See anything?
When's the last time we played a wedding, Jack?
Thank you, thank you.  You know, Susie and Jack and I only just arrived here yesterday, but already the people here at the King Corporation's Moorish Manor have made us feel, well, a part of the family. And it's their hope that, before you leave, everyone of you will feel a part of that family also.  So, if during-the next few days, we should happen to pass one another in the hallway or in the lobby or wherever ... don't be a stranger. Stop.  Say hello.  Introduce yourself.  Because here, there are no strangers, only friends. And family.  Right, Jack?
What?
The Royal.
Couple years.
April.
A useless talent.
What's happening to you, Frank?  You been kissing ass so long you're starting to like it?  You let that guy turn us into clowns tonight.  We were always small time, but we were never clowns, Frank. What's happened to your dignity?
Charlie called.
Yeah.  Larry Shelton.  Blackie.  Couple others. Donna said even Lloyd called the other day. Nothing like a little absence to make the heart grow fonder, huh?
This where the auditions are?
What do you mean?
Ready?
We need scissors over here! Who's got scissors?  Okay, remember.  Jack and I go on first, I do the set-up, then introduce you. And you say ...
Right.
You two could play checkers.
Oh yeah?
Tom here tells me there's a problem with the pianos.  We were assured they were in tune.
Then I'm afraid I don't understand.
Is that important?
You should've brought a leash, Mr. Barker. The doctor doesn't like to be bitten.
They never do, Mr. Barker.
The Park?  It's only two nights. Why throw away a night?
It wasn't business.  It was pleasure.
The both of them?  In there?
Oh. So what's it doing here?
Tell egghead I said hi.  If you see him.
Hey, what do you want to do?  Grow a beard?
Well, let's get your first prom under the belt, okay?
How's that dog of yours?  What was his name?
Yes.  Right.  Eddie.  How is he?
I hear you're a manicurist now -- got your own business and everything.  I'm glad you've stayed clean.
I was in a coma, Pollux. I still feel like shit.
Is someone there?
How's Loomis?
Go on.
-- Castor?
It can't be.  It's impossible.
You better be nice, Castor. You could get mighty lonely now that Pollux is gone.
Archer cut him a deal for turning state's evidence. He's free.
You've got someone in your office.
We gut the organization -- and rebuild it with more reliable friends.
All of them do.  We'll kill twelve birds with one bomb.  And we'll be rich.
Why do I feel like I'm on a blind date?
I'll deal with her later.
Sorry, Jack.  I told Dee and the kids I'd be home by dinner.  You know, it being Christmas Eve and all.
Take you, for instance...
This isnt my real life. Its just a glimpse...
Is it morning yet?
Cmon, Evelyn Thompsons got no class.  She doesnt marry Dr. Steve, the womans living in a trailer.
You know you seem pretty relaxed for a guy who just had a gun pulled on him.
Might wanna fasten your seat belt, Jack...
Ive got kids, Im going home...
I'm thinking I might walk tonight, Frank.
Every one of these songs will remind you of me in a slightly different way...
Christ...  Where the hell is the bathroom?
Thanks, Jack...
This is good stuff, Jack, keep it coming...
Our life in a nutshell...
I found it at an outlet store.  I know its a knock-off, but I think itll look great on you...
I think its good to be a little unsure about who you are.  Its very human.
Cmon, Jack, you think there arent mornings when I wake up and wonder what the hell Im doing in New Jersey...
My office is a dump, I answer my own phone...and youve seen my pay check.
I mean yes, I help people that need it...
This place is a perk, Kate.
I'm sorry...
Peter Lassiter...
It's Christmas Eve, Jack.
You don't know what it's like out there.  Walking around like some kind of circus freak.  People staring, whispering --
I mean...
What about his first born?
You go through something like this, makes you appreciate having the right woman in your life.
Time for <u>your</u> lesson, Vic.  Chem 101: what happens when you <u>supercool</u> hot metal...?  Ben...
No more cracks about how I look.
Reed said it'd be weeks till --
<u>Where is Reed</u>?
Twenty?  From outside the place looks a lot taller.
You're hot!
I mean, you feel a little feverish.
My shift ends at four, but I couldn't --
Uh, we call my sister the invisible girl...the Invisible Girl.
Our numbers are through the roof.  The IPO's tracking at fifty, sixty a share.  The bank's five times oversubscribed --
Then what is it?
Funny how things turn out, isn't it?
You're, you've, I mean, how have you bee--
It has to be the cloud.  It's fundamentally altered our DNA.
There were a lot of variables to consider --
You always talked about how you liked the kind of man who could approach you...speak his mind.  One who wasn't afraid to tell you what he wanted.
Victor, I'm sorry I --
Benes' natural defenses. White Corpuscles -- Antibodies. Once you begin to grow -- and become a menace to the body -- you'll trigger them off... MICHAELS With all the unknown factors in the body, I still say risking five lives for one is something we should reconsider --
Another delay... With only forty-two minutes left.
Wish I knew why.
Oh yes, great. The only problem is, he can't remember what he came to tell us.
Wouldn't it be quicker if we all helped?
That'll teach you where to keep your hand.
If you had a transistor about this size and power output, and a thin enough wire --  -- could you piece it together?
A surgeon might...
We can't take a second more.
Only to the naked eye.  Those corpuscles -- carrying oxygen -- give the stream its color. But the rest of the plasma's very much like sea water. An ocean of life...
You said there was a quick way out!
At this size, I would certainly think so.
Looks like somebody declared war.
Atomic fuel?
Yes, there is.
We could never fight that current it's physically impossible.
Just in town on business. Just in and out. Ha ha! A little of the old in-and-out!
Have ya been to the Celebrity Room before? With other, uh, clients?
She started shrieking, you know.
Well, he never done this before, but seein' as it's special circumstances and all, he says I can knock one hunnert off that TruCoat.
Where you girls from?
No, see, I don't need a finder's fee, I need - finder's fee's, what, ten percent, heck that's not gonna do it for me. I need the principal.
...You're the owner here, Mr. Lundegaard?
Well, you can help me. My name's Marge Gunderson -
Yah!
Yah!
Yah!  I... those are in the mail.
Yah.
Yah.
You're sayin' that we put in all the money and you collect when it pays off?
Where is everybody?
How we doin' on that vehicle?
Geez, that's a good lead. The Blue Ox, that's that trucker's joint out there on I-35?
...I'm sorry... I shouldn't a done this... I thought we'd have a really terrific time, and now I've...
You were such a super lady...  and then I... I been so lonely...
Whose car?
I love you, Margie.
You are a moron.
We need to talk.
I... I don't know.  I guess... when people think you're dying, they really listen, instead...
How did you find me?
That's the idea -- we split them.
I found a new one.
It's for men.
Look, this is a bad time...
I'm just on my way out...
Make sure.
You feel nothing?
Marla...
I'm sorry, I...
Marla... I need to talk to you.  It's going to take a tremendous act of faith on your part for you to hear me out.
I'm not paying this back.  I consider it "asshole tax."
Tonight, we're going to open the green door -- the heart chakra...
What do you do, Tyler?
I mean -- for a living.
... Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.
Go ahead.  Say it.
"I am Joe's Lungs."  It's written in first person.  "Without me, Joe could not take in oxygen to feed his red blood cells."  There's a whole series -- "I am Joe's Prostate."
If you ever say anything about me or about what happens here in this house, to her or anyone -- I will find out.  And you'll never see me again.  Promise me.
Promise you won't.
Promise?
Listen to me.  You have to consider the possibility that God doesn't like you, he never wanted you.  In all probability, He hates you.  This is not the worst thing that can happen...
We don't need him...
I feel sick.
What are you talking about?
No!  This isn't true.  We... we were around other people, together, both of us...
Wrong, wrong -- what about the car crash... the two guys in the backseat?
You took me to the house.
You have jobs.
What about Marla?
She's... you... you're fucking her.
Ask me nicely.
Defuse the bomb?
Why are you going with this, Ikea- boy?
S-S-Stuff.
The second one just dies.  A 16 year old kid.
What did you see?
I'm not sure I understand.
Look, you weren't there.  It was weird.  She knew that log truck was gonna cause an accident, she knew.  Never mind.
Last July I dialed a wrong number and got a radio station by accident. They asked me what number means "good luck" in Jewish.
I didn't.  Until I was dispatched to clean up one of the Flight 180 survivors.
Stop it, don't move him!
Want me to drive?
Thanks, Dad.  I'll call you.
Relax, Dad.  It's Daytona, not Mongolia.
You're all certifiable, you know that?  I can't believe I've been listening to this crap.  Come on, Tim, let's go outside.
That... him?
Those guys are probably fifteen minutes away.
You're payin' for my trip, Browning!
And then the cabin banged and the left side exploded. The the whole plane... blew up. It was so real. Exactly how everything goes.
I'm sorry we broke in.
SHUT UP, BILLY!
Again.
Cocktail party.  Uh huh, right.  Let's saddle up.
These guys look like they'd sell their mothers.
Gawd, you look awful.
Where's Nguyen now?  What city?
It's nice there.  He's probably digging every minute.  Got a surfboard.  Breaking girls' hearts.
Alternate LZ Zulu Sierra at 0500. It says "May have heat.  Don't be late.  All our love."
How long before you're fully on line?
Who're you?
Man, you are one scary-looking motherfucker!
Let's do it.
...My mother calls every week. Like a recurring nightmare. "So, have you met anyone?"..."No mom".. "So what's going to happen?"... "I don't know Mom"... I only thank God I moved out.
I think some people are meant to be alone.  Maybe I was a man in a former life and I used women for pleasure so now I'm paying for it - which would be fine, if I could just remember some of the pleasure parts... 
I don't feel like I make any impression on people... At office parties I spend my time re-arranging the hors d'oeuvres as people eat them, so the platters will always look full. I don't start conversations because I have no idea how to end them...I think I'm just meant to live in the background of things.
Well, it's funny!  Whatta want from me?
Then why the hell do we watch all the time?
Can I have my desk please.
Lydia?!  Lydia who!?
You're calling <u>Lydia</u> in <u>my</u> office. You must think I'm some dope.  You fuckin' bastard... You...  ... stay out all night long...
... I don't get a friggin' phone call.  You stroll in here at noon.  I got... two people out sick.  Ya think I need this?  I Do Not Need This!
It's so great to see you like this, honey... I can't tell you.
Parry?
Yeah so? The guy's beat up - he...he probably has a concussion or something, right?  He'll snap out of it?
But..How could that happen?
What if I was a relative?
Um...I've got to run. I've bee doing this all day.  Are you going to be all right?
Your name was picked.
A list.
Well there....  What's the difference?
You get a VCR with the membership.  ... For a short time until you get your own.  Listen, why don't you come down to the store and you can check it out.  See if you're interested.
This is it. I'm in hell. Damned to an eternity of idiotic conversation.
Thanks... You can keep the doll.
Pretty impressive huh?...Don't let it scare you. I'll admit it's formidable but everything has it's weakness.
O.K...let me explain this one more time...The Holly Grail is in -....
Of course there is, Jack. What do you think the Crusades were - a frat initiation? I don't think so...There has to be a Grail.
I don't need a job. I have a quest.
Tch. You are so sweet...Now I know why you're saying this. ...You're afraid I'm in danger and you're trying to protect me.
.....What are you doing?
Unhand that degenerate - you adolescent ass of a one balled donkey!
...I..uh..I get to read some of the books but mostly I..just calculate production costs from first edition hard cover publication to paperback. After paperback it's basically someone else's problem.
Well, id'n that nice.
I'm tryin', baby, so don't start gettin' mad now.
What?
Bobby...
Hey, mack!
Tea.
I'd rather drive up myself and... maybe go into Canada after... And I can't stay long, Tita, probably a week, at the most.
Oh no... Why? What is it? The way I look?
I probably am, but I don't care. I mean, I wasn't that blessed to begin with, and when would I have had time to make any improvements...
Constantly. Night and day. And unless I get up before the birds, I can't get in any practice time for myself...
Actually, it's very admirable, the way she works. She'll probably be enormously successful, because she's attractive as well, not that that's so important in music, but...
Like what?
Oh, let's not talk about my hair, it does what it wants to, and anyway, who cares, I want to talk about you...
You're leaving?
You were going without saying goodbye?
But what about me?
I mean, how could you not play anymore? That's so strange to me...
You don't call that music, though.
No, don't do that...
No. It's useless, Robert. It wouldn't work, not ever...
See? There's nothing wrong with the way I walk. Now where are we?
You know, just after I came back off tour with the Betenthaller Quartet, Dad, myself and Herbert had a summit conference about you...
I don't know where you were, penis envy.
Mass production is what does it.
Wait a minute. I'm not that neat, maybe, but I am clean.
In my personal observation, I think that more people are neat than are clean...
Yeah, it could be adorable...
I told you, no. I'm not that type.
See, I got you, you are so scared. I don't believe that you kissed no girls. That you got three girls and that you faithful and this and that.
Well, you know I'm standin' here and you say I look good?
No you didn't, you ain't provin'it.
Amanda is Eddie's cousin.
You looking for somebody?
You here to see somebody?
Who?
What she look like?
Yo, that's my girl.
Never heard of him. Thanks anyway.
What?
After I shoot you, I stick the knife in my arm, then place it in your dead hand. Self-defense. We don't do this very much anymore... but we have. Got rid of a lot of minorities that way.
Ask anybody.
Jerry, you're simply going to have to trust me. I've got a foolproof way to get rid of this guy and now you're jeopardizing everything.
Is there anything particular you're looking for?
Well, if he had one, it would certainly be in here.  Wait. Here it is. Yep. Surgical removal of two moles. Tissue was benign.
That's it.
I guess not.
He doesn't read my stuff well.  'Sally Ann and Alan were married four years ago and never divorced, making Stanwyk a bigamist even in Utah. Stanwyk is also traveling with three million dollars in cash, the result of Gail Stanwyk's conversion of Boyd Aviation stock. Mrs. Stanwyk believed the money was to be used to purchase property in Utah, but it wasn't; a fact that can be confirmed by realtor James Swarthout of Provo.'  That was stupid, Alan.
Has he?
Then he has.
Fat Sam is turning state's evidence.
He wrote me a nice deposition. He says he just received the drugs. You did the selling.
Sure you did.
LAX. Go to the Pan Am desk. There will be a ticket waiting for you.
Rio. Flight 306. Departs at eleven PM.
It'll be a first class-ticket. I'm sure you'll enjoy the ride. I would recommend staying down there at least a year, Mr. Nugent.
I am not someone who leaves a great deal to chance, Mr. Nugent.
Yes. All you provide are the gloves, the passport, and the aim. I'll take care of everything else.
That's right.
My hero.
Stay!  I must be having an off day. I'm really a fabulous player.
I bet you do.
Alan's in Utah.
Okay. I'm delighted to have someone to talk to, and you're very cute, so I'm very flattered, but I'm also very married so you may as well forget -- You are trying to hit on me, aren't you?
If I had a nickel for every one of Alan's flyboy buddies who tried to pick me up, I'd be a rich woman.
'I've been so many places in my life and times. I've sung a lot of songs, I've made some bad rhymes...'
'I've acted out my life on stages, with ten thousand people watching...'
'But we're alone now, and I'm singing this song for you.'
Can I ask you a question?
Are you still in love with Alan?
Why'd you let me in?
Thanks, I feel much better. Listen, if you're so bored, why didn't you go to Utah with Alan?
Good point.
What about his parents?
What's wrong, Gail?
No.
Your call is come through.
Now, Irwin, try to follow me. You can't run the ad and then not run the story.
Oh, Margie, sorry, Frieda lost the number of Alan's realtor in Provo. Can you give it to me real quick?
Now that we've broken the ice...
Zuzu Petals.  You want me to rescue her from the gorgeous hell that is L.A.
What cheap shit... hey, waiter!
Thanks for the promotion, man.
Sorry, Jazz.  After this, I'll throw a burger down your throat, okay?
Hello, Ford...
Zuzu Petals!  Zuzu Petals!  Yes! Who killed Bobby Vomit?  Who killed Johnny Crunch?  Why do people want you so goddamn bad?
Why are you depressed?  You get in all the clubs, you never pay cover...
Suck a dick, I left my purse...
Reality-reality-reality -- Outrageous building, huh?
So, Zuzu.  Are you okay?
So, did you find my dad?
Yeah, go on...
I want you to say that you're the biggest sissy in the whole wide world.
Actually you're a bit off in the motivation department... I mean, revenge is so... Bronson.  Wait, where's the third C.D.?  How could you come here without proof? It's a three piece set here!  A computer disc from Colleen, Bobby's computer disc, and Johnny's computer disc.  Together they make, oh fucking forget it!
I'm still the king!
What about you?  Can you stand a toss?
You don't use shit?
Calm down -- Henri!  You must trust me -- this is an extremely complicated situation to which there is a simple solution if you do exactly what I tell you.  It's worth more money to you.
Are you sure it is dead?
I got no music!
I got this little chick I'm tryin' to hit on.  She's about 20, 21... I take her to Jilly's last night and she's tellin' me about how she wants to settle down one day, get married... I says, "Hey, this is 1971, baby, I'm just a dirty old man lookin' to score with some pussy."
Yeah.  In the late innings.  Ya look like a night's sleep wouldn't kill ya.
When ya go back on?
Come on -- one drink.  Whatta you say?
I'm goin' check on this address in the Bronx, if you're bullshitting me, it's your ass.
This fella Nicoli's got a record in France, Walter.  He's wanted for questioning in the murder of a French cop.
What am I, a shmuck?  What's the hurry?  He could see a couple of shows and visit the top of the Empire State Building.
Frank.  We gotta go back.  Frank...
Butch called.
He did.
Then you gotta hide it somewhere. Somewhere where nobody's gonna find it...for 29 years!  Put it under the loose floorboard by the window!
Frank, this is not the time to be worried about covering up if you had a thing with this girl.
Uh, hello?
29 years...?
No, not yet.
Right here, Chief.  Sorry I lost you last night.  Damn thing keeps cutting out.
Are you alright"?
What?  Johnny, what's wrong?
What?  What is it?
Whatta you mean she's not here?
She just died, your mother just died?
Hang on a sec, John.
Dad, what the hell is going on?
John.  John, you all right?
She makes ten.
So how'd you like LION KING?
I know.  I'm sorry.  Work.
Hell-
What're you gonna do?
That was the best yet.  Was it you... me... or the hammock?
What's the matter?!
This door was open just a minute ago, wasn't it?
You know him?
I don't see anything.
Why do you do these stupid things?!
You don't "have to."
I do like you.  But not when you act like a jerk.
I never said you were "nothing".
Oh, jeez.
Once we nail Roy, that's it. Victory is ours.
That's your problem, Larry. That's why your sales are always below quota.  Your instinct to eat is stronger than your instinct to win.
Rick.  Keep and eye on our wacko kid.  I'll be back as soon as I can.
Sorry, Megan.  Not this time.
I can't believe no one called back.  I better...
Jason is alive.  We dug up his body.  I was gonna cremate it and...
With extreme car, for God's sake. If that kid is with her, there's every good chance he'll do something crazy.
Steven...
Hello...
Jessica, I'm so sorry.  I...I wanted to have this cleaned up before you got here.
Well?
Are you crazy?!
Have you seen Tamara?
But she might be in trouble...
Well...how do you feel?
What's that?
Let's go -- we're running two minutes late.
There must be a phone around here somewhere.
Whatever you've been...imagining... has nothing to do with Jason Voorhees.  I want you to be safe, Rennie. That's all I care about.
I had a skiing accident in high school, broke my left leg. It took three winters before I would even look at the snow again...but the solution kept eluding me.  I finally took lessons. I've never broken a bone since.
Maybe not. But you're not telling me everything, are you?
I don't know...we've gone off course or something...
I wrapped my sandwiches in tinfoil. I ate and drove. I had one of those big checkered cabs.
Crosstown.
How is Lillian? I haven't seen her.
Don't talk like that.
That sounds so final. But are we really surprised?
But didn't we know it would happen?
In other words why should we suffer silently at this kind of abuse? The man is out there ruining lives.
He'll hate it.
I'm proud of this play. It's so different from anything you've done.
We're able to surprise each other.
Because we're completely mismatched.
And you blame me. It's because we never talk. Let's talk.
Can we talk later? Will you be at the party?
I have this thing where I have to know a person is being honest with me before, you know, I can feel completely free to be myself.
What do we want?
Deception isn't something I personally consider sexy.
Knowing who a person is. Down deep.
Great game. Red Sox are winning.
It's a constant shock to me, how small this place is. How did we do it? Five people in these little rooms.
You're a family man, Frankie?
An how many years does it take a person to make his family safe and secure and happy, and then in one dumb moment, what does he do?
Then they lost?
If they lost tonight, they'll lose tomorrow. It's all over.
They're my team.
What do you mean?
Why?
What? Come on, Paisley.
Yes.
Sora was sent to tell me I -- I must rake and cover the latrine.
It is the work of untouchables.
I am your wife.
Enough.
I'm sure your legs are quite as handsome as mine.
Maybe I'm wrong... maybe we're not ready yet. In South Africa the numbers were small...
It's beautiful.
We hope you intend to join us in the struggle for Home Rule, Mr. Gandhi.
We need your help!
Hm. Of course it is not quite that simple.
Bapu, for me, and the rest,  if that is what you want, we will accept it. But out there  already there is rioting because Hindus fear you are going to give too much away.
How much extra?
The skin flake was found in Michael's Restaurant. The employees are all accounted for.
We believe we have a suspect.
What's wrong with it?
Suit yourself.
German.
Let's get out of here.
And keep your lashes on your lids where they belong.  How could you be so careless?
I have your samples ready.

Perhaps we ought to celebrate, Irene.
What happened?
So you're not so smart after all.  I want you to know--if it ever came to it-- I'd be willing to get an ovum from the Egg Bank.  In fact, I'd <i>rather</i> use a donor egg--  --<i>if</i> it came to it.
You hypocrite.  Do you think for one moment you'd be doing what you're doing if it wasn't for who you are--<i>what</i> you are?  Don't you get <i>any</i> satisfaction knowing that your children will be able to live to a ripe old age unless they do something foolish?
What are you doing?
I told you, the government pays.  It's all taken care of.
Hello, McCoy.
I'm sorry I was late... I got my hair done... the girl was slow.
Wait... give me a minute.
You know how I feel?
How long ago.
That would be the first time.
Do what I tell you, it's not a game.
You're crazy.
Three years ago I dynamited some fish at the reservoir.
How was that?
Where we go in1?
I don't think you have to worry much about Harold. He won't do anything.
You can trust him...
Two years.
What about the brakes?
How'd it happen, then?
Who paid you to see me off?
It is. Honestly.
Does Brumby get a kick out of that crap?
You all right now?
You coming to South America?
Said he'd heard you were up in town. Wondered if I knew where you was staying. Wanted to look you up. Old time's sake.
Nowt.
Ta.
Thorpey nearly died laughing.
What about Keith?
What you going to do?
You're a bastard.
Well, well. Small world, isn't it?
Oh, I'm straight.  Respectable.
Oh, you've been watching television.
Not going, Jack?
Of course, of course. Well, any time, just drop by.
What's that? A hundred?
They did.
They did.
We're stuck with this...
...this shit...
It is.
It's too...
You're on this...
I, I...I...
I...
What could somebody get for them?
A job with Graff.
He'd give me a job.
Fine.
See...?  Were you the guy who broke in?
Yes.
Then don't sweat it, George, you know why?
You have nothing to hide.
Yeah.  You know who doesn't?
Thieves.
They're inured to it.
I don't know, George, why?
And I don't want any fucking shit and I don't give a shit, Lingk puts me over the top, you filed it, that's fine, any other shit kicks out you go back.  You...you reclose it, 'cause I closed it and you...you owe me the car.
John...John...John.  Okay.  John. John.  Look:  The Glengarry Highland's leads, you're sending Roma out.  Fine. He's a good man.  We know what he is.  He's fine.  All I'm saying, you look at the board, he's throwing...wait, wait, wait, he's throwing them away, he's throwing the leads away.  All that I'm saying, that you're wasting leads. I don't want to tell you your job. All that I'm saying, things get set, I know they do, you get a certain mindset... A guy gets a reputation.  We know how this...all I'm saying, put a closer on the job. There's more than one man for the... Put a...wait a second, put a proven man out...and you watch, now wait a second--and you watch your dollar volumes...You start closing them for fifty 'stead of twenty- five...you put a closer on the...
No.  John.  No.  Let's wait, let's back up here, I did...will you please?  Wait a second.  Please.  I didn't "blow" them.  No.  I didn't "blow" them.  No.  One kicked out, one I closed...
Alright.
Ah, fuck.  Leads!  Leads! Williamson!  Send me out!  Send me out!
Get 'em to me!
Okay: I...look: I'm going to make it worth your while.  I am.  I turned this thing around.  I closed the old stuff, I can do it again. I'm the one's going to close 'em. I am!  I am! 'Cause I turned this thing a...I can do that, I can do anyth...last night.  I'm going to tell you, I was ready to Do the Dutch.  Moss gets me, "Do this, we'll get well..." Why not.  Big fuckin' deal.  I'm halfway hoping to get caught.  To put me out of my...  But it taught me something.  What it taught me, that you've got to get out there.  Big deal.  So I wasn't cut out to be a thief.  I was cut out to be a salesman.  And now I'm back, and I got my balls back...and, you know, John, you have the advantage on me now: Whatever it takes to make it right, we'll make it right.  We're going to make it right.
...the fuck is that supposed to mean...?
Just now.
Mr. Morton's with American Express... he's...  I can tell Jim what you do...?
Ray is director of all European sales and services for American Ex...  But I'm saying you haven't had a meal until you've tasted...I was at the Lingks' last...as a matter of fact, what was that service feature you were talking about...?
"Home Cooking"...what did you call it, you said it...it was a tag phrase that you had,,,
Home...
The monthly interview...?
Yes.  Is this something that I can talk ab...
Money?  If that's what it signifies to you. Security?  Comfort?  All it is is THINGS THAT HAPPEN TO YOU.  That's all it is.  How are they different?  Some poor newly married guy gets run down by a cab.  Some busboy wins the lottery.  All it is, it's a carnival.  What's special...what draws us?  We're all different.  We're not the same.  We are not the same.  Hmmm.  It's been a long day.  What are you drinking?
Well, let's have a couple more.  My name is Richard Roma, what's yours?
Today.  Today.  Which, in any case, it was not, as there were a couple of points on the agreement I wanted to go over with you in any case.
You cashed the check?
They didn't get your contract.  I filed it before I left.
...Mr. Williamson...
Who is the greatest man you can think of?
Honey!  Wait a minute; let's go for a drive.
I think there's only two hundred dollars under my hat.  I'm right.  Only two hundred dollars.
Mike, I got something special up my sleeve for these boys.  You ever hear of &quot;Superman?&quot; And I don't mean the comic book.
What did I tell you.  The one who cut him was found in an alley.  And the family of the others paid Fanucci all their savings to make him forswear his vengeance.
You're going to talk to him now.
Will you tell him?
Do you think they have somebody to back up Cicci?
It might show.
What the hell are you talking about?
No strings.
No one can trace anything to me; I pride myself on that.
A little; what's so thought- provoking about that?
Leave her alone!  You're talking as though she has no right to be frightened when there are machine guns going off in her backyard.
You have to be careful what you say in front of the others... they frighten easy.  It's always been that way, most men frighten easy.
My concern is that the three million never arrived at Batista's numbered account in Switzerland. He thinks it's because you have second thoughts about his ability to stop the rebels.
Then you have to trace it.  Michael, people here look at me as a reliable man.  I can't afford not to be looked on as a reliable man.  But you know all that; there's nothing you can learn from me.  You shouldn't have to put up with a sick old man as a partner.
The hotel's registered owners are one Jacob Lawrence, and Sidney Barclay, both Beverly Hills attorneys.  In reality it's split between the Old Lakeville Road Group from Cleveland, and our friend in Miami.  He takes care of others outside the country, you know who I mean.  Meyer Klingman runs the store, and does all right, but I've been instructed to tell you, that if you move him out, our friend in Miami will go along with you.
The Corleone family controls two major hotels in Vegas; one in Reno. The licenses were grandfathered in, so you had no difficulties with the Gaming Commission.  But I have the idea from sources...  ...that you're planning to move in on the Tropicana.  In another week or so you'll move Klingman out, which leaves you with only one technicality.  The license, which is now in Klingman's name.
I have already rented the apartment to another family.
I've already rented it; I cannot disappoint the new tenants.  They're paying a higher rent.
You know what?  I think you guys are all jealous.
I've gotten to know someone who's famous.
The Master is dressing.  I am to offer you a drink.  There is whiskey and there is iced tea.
You must leave.  You were not here this morning.
The police will not know that. They will want to investigate.
Do you want to be questioned about you and Mr. Jimmy?  Please, Clayton.  It will be better if I find the body alone.
I apologize for going on like this. It's the Sunday painter in me.  Of course I can understand your refusal.  It's a great deal to ask of someone.
Indeed.  I'd pay for the privilege of drawing your head.
Even an amateur artist needs a subject to inspire him.
What are you suggesting?  You'll charge extra if I include a hand or a bit of shoulder.
You have to excuse me, Mr. Boone. Since my stroke, I am often overcome with nostalgia.
Can I see what you did so far?
Sorry.  Not today.
Isn't it enough you told me you're a fairy?  Do you have to rub my nose in it?
If you don't mind driving, I'd like to take you as my guest.  There should be lots of pretty starlets to keep you amused.
Very good, Clayton.  May I call you Clayton?  Or do you prefer Boone?
I better get you home before you catch your death from pneumonia.
The morning after Pearl Harbor, he drove down to St. Louis to reenlist.  He was so damn excited. World War II was going to be his second chance.  They told him he was too old...fat ...nearsighted.  Said he'd be more use to his country if he stayed home and looked after his family.
I figured he'd think, you know -- it was the next best thing.  Hey, I loved it too.  A chance to be a part of something important. Something bigger than yourself.
All right.  Let's take it off now.
I'm up.  Thanks.
Where's Betty?
My God.  Is the audience to presume that Colin and I have done her hair?  I thought we were mad scientists, not hairdressers.
Oh no, my dear.  You look absolutely amazing.  There's no way I can compete with you.  The scene is yours.
I would've thought Mr. Leslie Howard would be more your line.
Mr. Kay, sir.
Does the yardman come today?
So, Mr. Kay?  What do you want to know?
Can that count as one question?
How's the leg?
Yeah -- ?
Sound it out for me.
Let's get out there. And have them run down every 167 Shelby Mustang in the area ... Find out where they're at.
I know you.
I guess ...
okay ...
Got it ...
For real. Okay. Gimme COLUMBO...
What color?
We're on a truncated time-table. Take a day to shop it; a day to prep it ... And we're still going to need to expand the crew...
You look good...
What are you doing back?
okay, sir. Let me just get the-order. Yes. We'll be doing some work out your way. We've got a power leak. And it's unsafe. We're moving residences to the... Marriott Long Beach ... Just for the night ...
Hey, Kip ...
So what are you gonna do?
"About what?"
You okay -- ?
Where you off to -- ?
Okay. We're all here. Today's Wednesday. D-Day is Friday night ... That gives us two days to prep ... We're going to find the ladies on our list, find out where they live, when they're home; that they're properly insured ... Let's get into the vans --
What kind of trouble -- ?
And you got some Italians -- ?
I'm not doing it anymore. Haven't for a while. I've carved out something for myself. It's pathetic, but it's mine ...
Ready -- ?
Donny got shot ... A jacker ...
You think it can be done?
Tell me...
The hard part ...
Is he still working here ?
This Eleanor's been living at the International Towers for 3 years now.
The 167 Mustang Shelby Mustang GT-500.
Which way's out, man -- ?
Paulie.  You're all I got.  I need help.
I'm gonna need some money.
I had everybody working.  Even our old babysitter.
We got a problem, that thing we took care of upstate?
Well, we gotta dig him up again.
The guy just sold the property. They're gonna build condominiums and I don't want anybody digging up the little bastard.
It's still better than letting somebody find him.
I can't eat,  just get me some coffee.
I think you got a good shot at beating the case.
It's that rat bastard from Pittsburgh. He ratted you all out. He's been a rat since he got busted in Pittsburgh.
He's hiding, thE son of a bitch, in Florida.
I gotta go home.
The third store down.
Who's she talking to?
She didn't do it again did she?
How's the woman?
What?
Sorry, brother.  I don't know what to tell ya. You know all the girls I been with. You been with 'em too, except for Cheryl McGovern which was a big mistake on your part brother...
Oh, right.
Morgan, I'm not goin' to "Kelly's Roast Beef" just cause you like the take-out girl. It's fifteen minutes out of our way. MORGAN What else we gonna do we can't spare fifteen minutes?
Chuck, let's go.
Hey, come on pal we're in classes all day. That's one thing about Harvard never seizes to amaze me, everybody's talkin' about school all the time.
Excuse me. Is this the buildings and grounds office?
I'm trying to find the name of a student who works here.
Could you just check, because the young man who works in my building--
Oh, for God's sake, Will.
I told you to cooperate with these people.
This job... Do it if it's what you really want.
I've been busy, Gerry. I got a full schedule.
Seems like it's going well.
Well, have you talked to him at all about his future?
Jobs doing what?
That's great, Gerry, that there's interest-- But I'm not sure he's ready for that.
Sean, do you have any idea what the odds are against winning the lottery?
About thirty million to one.
That's why I love stock-car racin'. That Dale Ernhart's real good.
I could work the pit maybe, but I could never drive like Dale Ernhart--
Yeah, I read your book. "Mike" had the same problems as "Chad" the stockbroker.
You're right. I know.
No, but, I mean you know...I do other things. That no one knows about.
I go places, I interact.
If you ever disrespect my wife again...I will end you.
Do you think you're alone?
Do you have a soul-mate?
Someone who challenges you in every way. Who takes you places, opens things up for you. A soul-mate.
I just want you to know, Sean...
I'll keep in touch.
I really don't 'date' that much.
No I haven't...
No I wasn't...
Why do we always stay here?
I've never seen your place.
What about your friends? Or your brothers? When do I get to meet them?
I think I can make it to South Boston.
Is it me you're hiding from them or the other way around?
When?
What if I said I wouldn't sleep with you again until you let me meet your friends?
Yeah.
Go on. Get in your tent. You don't know nothin'.
*Some*body got to take the blame. They just *got* to hang it on somebody, you know.  An' I ain't doin' nothin' but set around.
Lissen. I don't care nothin' about you, but if you mess in this, your whole fambly li'ble to get in trouble, an' Tom get sent back to the penitentiary.
Tom? You can come on. They gone.
Want to work?
That's not your affair. Name.
How many men?
Women?
Kids?
Can all of you work?
This used to be mine. I give it to Grampa when I went away.  You reckon they could be dead?
I guess that's right. Have to take a beatin' before he'll know.
I never asked you!
What's the matter, Grampa?
We gonna live here?
I like the tent better.
That!
Ma, you sick?
Look, Ma!
Didn' you get no sleep?
Was Granma bad?
When?
An' that's why you didn't want 'em to look?
What is it?
Well?
Either we got to tie him up and *throw* him on the truck, or somepin. He can't stay here.
Whatta you think you're talkin' about? I got a han'bill here says good wages, an' I seen it in the papers they need pickers!
But what about this?
Jes' like in the catalogues, ain't they!
What's this?
We had pictures put on, that way everybody knows who everybody was!
So, what are you doing now?
Oh I see. You got your individual slices of hope, dignity, confidence, self-love, justice, and harmony.
So you eat-- read it everyday?
And these pan pizzas have opened up the doors to heaven?
Are you there?
He was trying to kill you, right!
Not the other way around...?
Is it something you've done?
Anyway, that never use to happen. I was always the prodigy. Now I'm just one of the guys.
If I show up at your door, chances are you did something to bring me there. I don't care about that stuff, anyway.
It's a free-market evolution. You'll wake up to it... c'mon Kid. We used to run together when you were a rookie. I don't want to run against you. This thing's real. Everybody's in.
I'm an attorney. I'm with Moss, Brice & Fromeyer.
He's falling for her. Look at him.
You're wrong. Look at his face.
This is not good.
So what happened to you?
Good evening, Mr. Newberry.
How are you? How's business?
How's that?
I took the other road. I'm more of a self-reflective young lion who does business with lead-pipe cruelty and goes home to drink light beer in milky-eyes isolation. I love sports and sex and have no real relationships with anyone. And you?
I don't have a problem with that. It's up to Annie.
He's beautiful.
I hear that! See, I knew she was never going to be a ranchest, but I wanted to try -- I thought maybe she'd give music lessons to the kids in town or at the school, maybe even recitals. My son would grow up here. Maybe have one or two more. I'd teach 'em what I could. They'd play with my brother's kids. All grow up together. And even if they all decided to go out into the world, they'd always know where home was -- cause we'd keep it for 'em...
Yeah, I think it is. And I don't mean everybody's got to be married, have kids -- It's more like, knowing where you're from, where you belong, what feeds you, where you can go no matter what happens... Knowing what you're supposed to be doing while you're here.
I don't know any other way, Annie.
IT'S ALMOST LUNCHTIME. ARE YOU HUNGRY!?
Fine!
We'll have more room because we're moving onto the ranch. They have this empty house near this creek. It's actually pretty... OK... I love you.  Dad wants to talk to you.
I don't deserve that. I have never looked at you as a disappointment. If I'm on your back to do better, if I push you to try harder it's because I want you to be the best you can be.
Smokey told me he left last night to look at some horses in Sheriden. He won't be back for three days. I can't believe he didn't want to say goodbye.
I'm sorry about last night. I shouldn't have brought it up over the phone.
"... FRESH, WIND IN HER HAIR... LIFE WITHOUT CARE... SHE'S BROKE... BUT IT'S 'OK'...
Yeah. She seems to be getting more comfortable on the ranch, which is why I said yes to this move. But, whenever it's just the two of us, I don't know... Anyway... what's happening with the Delco lawsuit?
Was the trip okay?
How's Peterson's holding up for you?
What?
I don't think anybody can make Tom do anything he didn't want.
... well, I just think she's got a lot of nerve showing up here. Draggin' that child and that poor animal all the way...  You eat with those fingers again and you know what'll happen!  Frank, don't you think she's got a nerve?
He says if you do it soon as they're born, it makes them real easy to handle later on.
We thought we lost him in the snow storm... Told the kids. Had a funeral for the damn thing. Finally, snow stops. Staring to warm up. I go out and start cleaning the truck... Goddamn if that dog doesn't jump out from the back seat covered in snow... I nearly stained myself.
I can't...
It's warmer than I thought.
I thought your mom's coming up?
You want to watch some television?
Is the poverty worse, now, you think?
Welcome to our show!
Shit!
Ta-da!
One-handed!
Due to Mr. Gill's untimely demise and everything, I guess you two will have to improvise the next round.
Lauren Murphy is now a wanted felon in the state of Washington. Forgery, Embezzlement, two drug convictions, plus she jumped parole. When she's arrested, she will not have a trial, she will not pass go, she will go directly to jail. Then I change this file back to the original, and your mom disappears.
What can I tell you. Computers never lie, kid. Your mom will be arrested at work, she'll be handcuffed, and later, strip searched.
Two days.
Burn. You're Acid Burn. You booted me out of OTV!
I'm Crash Override.
Why did he come to you?
Oh, wow, she's great.
Hello?
Good.
I need a handle, man. I don't have an identity until I have a handle.
A hacker planted the virus.
Yesterday, the ballast program for a supertanker training model mistakenly thought the vessel was empty, and flooded its tanks.
The little boat flipped over. A virus planted in the Gibson computer system claimed responsibility.
Purpose of visit?
You're late.
Yeah, ha, hell of a night huh?
I'll take you down there.
You think she stands a chance?
Mom, please
Not tonight. I've got that date with Brady. You know how important that is.
Can't you find somebody else?
What am I supposed to tell Brady? Sorry, but I've got to baby-sit my foster sister, go and have fun by yourself.
Yes.
Has he been prepped?
I do.
Kido. It's four in the morning.
What is this? Four nights in a row?  You going for a record here?  The seven year olds insomniacs hall of fame?
Oh, serious questions tonight.  Of course I love you.
Jamie, sometimes it's...
Come on Rachel!
I thought you said you were ready.
You don't believe that do you?
Logan, I want you to stay here in case the family gets back.
You look sharp. You understand?
Something?
How's it powered?
Hi, Annie, Laurie...
What?
Someone broke into the hardware store. Probably kids.
Look.
Fancy.
I'm glad you're here because I have something I want you to do. I want you to call up Ben Tramer and tell him you were just fooling around.
Yes, you can.
I wonder where they went.
Anybody live here?
Annie, some day you're going to get us all in deep trouble.
Laurie...
I'm scared!
What did he say?
I don't think this is any time to be funny...
What are your favorite buildings, David?
Oh, yeah.
Oh!
Uh-- APRIL  I-i-it has an o-organic quality, you know.
Mm-hm.
The design's deliberately noncontextural.  But I wanted to... keep the atmosphere of the street, you know, and the proportions.
Now I ca-can't remember.
Hi, Dusty.
Yeah.
Fine.  Oh, we went to the Caravaggio exhibition at the Met.  It's such a treat to go through a museum with Frederick.  I mean...you learn so much.  Do you like Caravaggio?
Uh...did you ever get around to e.e. cummings?
O-o-o-okay, Lee.  Okay, okay.  You, you, y-you've said enough.  It's my responsibility now.  I will work things out.
Yes, but you, you do care about me.
But it hasn't been forever. 
Yeah, but we-we made so many plans.
Yes.  I know.  The last few weeks, you haven't been yourself.  And tonight at, tonight at dinner, you, you were kind of curt with me.
Yes, you were.  A-and when I, when I brought up the idea of having a baby, you just, you jumped down my throat.
Why not?
Why do you say that?  Is there something wrong?
Well, tell me.  Should I be worried?
I want one with you.
But what do, what do you--  what's that mean?  W-w-we've been, we've been married for four years. How settled can things get?
Yeah, but I...uh--I thought you needed that.  When-when-when we met, you said your life was chaos.
...this is a toast!  This is a toast.
Why should I be afraid?
So?
Elliot lusts after you.
Oh, God, that's too much responsibility for me.  It's not fair!  I want a less complicated life, Frederick.  I want a husband, maybe even a child before it's too late.
Oh, God, I don't even know what I want.
Do you realize what a thread we're all hanging by?
Can you understand how meaningless everything is?  Everything!  I'm talking about nnnn--our lives, the show...the whole world, it's meaningless.
I hope you tell her it was your idea...
...'cause every time I try to be helpful, you know, sh-she gets so defensive.
Yeah, aren't you like, you know...
Yeah, they have these banks, you know, where they keep them frozen.
I want to experience childbirth.
Hannah, I have to borrow some more money.  Don't get upset.
Oh, Hannah!
He's such a loser!
Oh, he's such a loser!
Uh, you know, I think I can fake my way through a song.
Well, that...th-that's fine.
Wow, I guess I hit a nerve.
Now, Hannah, that's not what I meant, you know.  Uh, yeah, everybody relies on you for so much. "You're so giving. It's not a criticism.  We love you. We're grateful."
Mmm, I don't know if you remember me, but we had the worst night of my life together.
Yes, you do recall, right?
I was walking past and I saw you in here...
...and I thought I'd come in and...and we could replay, uh, the whole, uh...
Oh, that's putting it mildly.  We did everything but exchange gunshots.
Good.  How are you?
You look wonderful.
Yeah, really.  You do.  You do.
It was a terrible evening.
No, you can tell me straight.  It's okay.  Just, you know, tell me what you think.
Really?
Oh, it just came to me one day.
Oh, gosh, you really think I can write?
Right.
Oh!
Yeah, she knows it, too, 'cause she's flirting with all the men here.
Aren't you glad to see me?
You want to get married...?
You're ready now.
Hold up a minute...
First things first.
..It won't be long now, sir...
Yes sir, I saw it. 
I am all attention.
I said how's your baby...?
Waal...
And?  Then?
How could you know?
You know America?
Make them eat the figurine.
...I'm sorry....?
Indeed we were.
Freud, do you know...?  Freud psychoanalyzed patients in One Afternoon.
He saw the truth, and <u>spoke</u> it...
Yeah, well, it's a raw wound, innit, you're gonna bump it, every time you turn around... but you know what the <u>trick</u> is...?
Ask me when we get home.
She must be something special After Dark.
Thirty thousand dollars reward.  In the whereabouts of Il Dottore Fanelli, or the apprehension of his...
...sir...?
Now what? What did I do this time?
Man, she's losing it...

Hello?!  What's in it for me?
I'm sorry. It just...It seems silly. Like kissing a girl.
Isn't this the time where one of us says something deeply offensive to the other one...We're just so different.
When were you in Niagara Falls?
God, you're beautiful.
Betty, your daydreams are a lot better than my realities, believe me. I'm afraid though it's time to get your butt kicked.
Take a break Veronica, sit down.
Hey, this question wouldn't be that bizarro thing you were babbling about over the phone last......
You stupid cunt!
I think you can. In Catcher in the Rye Holden says his ideal job'd be making sure some kids don't fall off a cliff. He doesn't realize if you pay too much attention to the kids, you'll back off the cliff yourself.
Veronica! Color me stoked, girl. I've gotten <u>everyone</u> to sign this petition even the one who think BigFun are tuneless Eurofags. People love me!  My God, you haven't signed!
So some people need different kinds of "convincing" than others....  Hey, just sign the petition!
It was J.D.'s idea! He made out the signature sheet and everything. Now will you sign it?
Veronica. What are you doing tonight?
Ram asked me out, but he wants to double with Kurt and Kurt doesn't have a date.
Dreadful etiquette. I apologize.
Something tells me you picked up the wrong cup.
And your worst enemy.
Do you take German?
You believed it because you wanted to believe it. Your true feelings were too gross and icky for you to face.
Did to.
Did to.
Catch a movie? Miniature Golf?
How do you turn the fucker off?
The bomb, asshole!
You know what I want, babe?
Terrible thing. So will we get to meet this dark horse prom contender?
I'm so sorry. I was led to believe there were going to be different kinds of social and psychological types at this gathering.
No arguments there, Dr. Hulme! All that time inside working on those novels of theirs. They don't get fresh air or exercise!
I had a nasty foreboding feeling at first, but now I realise my crime was too frightful for an ordinary lecture.
And so, in a blazing fury, Charles runs Lancelot Trelawney through with his sword . . . leaving Deborah free to accept Charles's proposal of marriage!
I've heard your mother on 3YA. The Woman's Session has lots of lively debate.
0h, God . . . I'm so sorry!
What?
Poor Father . . .
What's happening to me? What are you doing?
Millions of people around the world get on busses every day. When was the last time you heard of anybody anywhere dying on a public transit bus?
Please. Heart attack. That was easy street.
Skin cancer.
Pitbull attacks.
The boss won't notice me doing a bad job because I'm not. Even if the boss thought I was slacking I'd know right away.
I have my connections
Last time anybody saw this woman she was alive. You seem to certain she's dead.
You win! Okay pull over.
You're alive...
What happens if I'm convicted of Kirsty's murder?
What's under that sheet...?
-Tawny.
Whoa, I have serious space issues, dude. What do you want?
Hey you're the guy from down the hall.
Which don't sound like such a bad goddamn idea, John.
Well, we gotta work this thing out, John.  It's a goddamn mess an' I'm halfway to doing serious time in the joint an' the TV lady's so stuck on you she don't want it to come out you stole her purse because it might break the heart of millions.  Looka those maniacs, willya?  They love you, for Chrissake!
Great!  You make this big goddamn mess, then ya jump.  Beautiful! Listen, John, I was there at the hospital today, I seen you with those little bastards .
I'm not saying I hate sick people or anything but I hate being <u>around</u> them if you know what I mean.  There <u>you</u> go, you <u>inspire</u> this kid to <u>live</u>.  I probably woulda vomited on him.
Listen, now that I owe you twenty-five hundred bucks plus, how about loaning me twenty for cab fare?
Hey, you could call me "Bernie," forget the "Mister LaPlante" stuff.  You are naive.
Bill, I...
I...
Bill, I got some legal problems and I...
Bill, listen...
Bill, I got financial problems and...
This guy, this "friend" your mother's seeing, he's a fireman, huh?  He ever... spend the night, whatsisname?
Oh yeah?  A hero, huh?  Was he in the 'Nam, this guy Elliot?
It was this war.  Viet Nam.  Doesn't matter.
You never saw that picture, huh?
Uh, no.  But I, uh, wonder if you could up support... support a program to help the needy and...
"A little mistake"!
There's a lot of confusion around what went on last night, it's not clear...
Whaddaya mean what do I wanna know? I wanna know everything.  Who's this screwball LaPlante for Pete's sake, what the hell's he doing out there, auditioning for the priesthood? You're supposed to be on top of this, Gale, don't...  "Quit!"  You can't quit!  It's unprofessional!
I didn't say I thought we should have saved him..
Look at that.  You can't buy better protection than that.  That there is your Man's Best Friend.
They're great with kids.  They love 'em.  They eat 'em up.  I'm kidding.
And how are things with your lady friend, if I may call her that?
That's terrific.  Don't be afraid to be demonstrative.  You're sounding a lot more confident than when we last spoke.
As long as you keep remembering why.
The whole disapproval thing.  If you allow yourself to get into a situation where someone else's potential disapproval becomes the focal point of your life -- then you're back to a life of fear, aren't you?  -- You're a prisoner to that again, and that isn't much of a life.
And please, don't for God's sake misinterpret that as being the voice of discouragement in any way --
On the contrary -- this is tremendous.  I mean, we're all frightened to death of disapproval and we're constantly hiding behind these layers we manufacture for ourselves -- and I'm not saying we should, you know, <u>declare</u> ourselves unhesitatingly to our fellow human beings in the interests of total openness and honesty --
That would be monumentally stupid. All I'm saying is --
Yeah, right -- I really have to go to bed.
Mommy!
Neil -- what --
Honey --
Do you remember who gave us this?
Did the cleaning woman come?
Who was that?
And what was that neighbor guy doing here?
Are we gonna buy this house?
You knew a second ago.  <u>Who</u> started it?
Lieutenant Bedsoe?
I'm in the middle of an interrogation, Captain.
What?
You don't understand.  About seven years ago we found the body of a guy named Vasilnic in Jersey.  A week later in the parking lot of Madison Square Garden we found Iman Fasil. Three days after that Luman Castageer was found in an alley.  The fourth body we've never been able to identify.  All four men died from decapitation.  Nash was our primary suspect -- but he disappeared.
Seven years ago I interviewed a guy. He said he saw two men fighting in an alley with swords.  One cut off the others head.  He shot the surviving guy twenty times and he got right back up and stabbed him.
The river.
That was two hundred and fifty years ago -- and the pain still scars your heart.  Would you live that pain again?
We had a bargain.  You promised.
Where did you get it?
You have an interesting accent. Where are you from?
Where will you go now?
Must you fight him?
Do you?  Then why don't you go out? Meet someone.  Make a life for yourself instead of hiding away in the past?
I'm having some people over tonight for dinner -- I'd like you come.
I'm glad you've come home, Conner.
Good afternoon, Mr. Parker.
Would you like to deposit this in your account?
This check is for sixteen thousand dollars.  That's a lot of cash to be carrying around.
Worst case, it's a bloodbath.  The detectives come out with Smith's computer, and we go directly to jail, do not pass Go.
<u>Get on the floor</u>!
Jesus.  What is this?
Yeah.  I'm Rooney.
You got a sniper out there, gonna shoot me?
That's right.  That's a good idea, Mars.
Are you out of your mind?
All right.  Now the second one.
We can't carry him.
I'm not gonna leave you!
Please get away from me.
I'm not going to wake him.  I don't even know that I can.
Louise?
Call Jane for me.  She's at the little Thai place.
Excuse me?  <u>You</u> requested our help.  You turned over command --
We've got to get those kids out of there!
Those kids are in there with a fucking psychopath!  He <u>kills</u> people!
I don't see any people names.  It's all businesses.
Marlon and Al....
I can't control what happens.  The Sheriffs are running the scene.
Also, could you remember to use the service entrance at all times?
Here, here, a thousand US dollars - fifty thousand francs for my family. To let us drive off to the Mille Collines.
You're fucking black! You're not even a nigger, you're African!  They're not staying to stop this thing. They're gonna fly right out of here with their people.
I will see what I can do.
I am strong, Paul, like a lion.
You are a marked man.
The Americans, and the UN they have you as a war criminal. You are on a list.
Holy shit! Holy shit.
Gregoire it is good to see you back to work.
Are you trying to make a fool of me? There are no Europeans left in that hotel. Get me the names of all the cockroaches in there.
I'm afraid you will have to move room.
I'm going to put you on the third floor.
Yes they are. However if the army return they will expect important people such as yourself to be in these grand rooms.
Paul! Paul's eyes adjust, he recognizes many of his neighbors, all crowded into this small room. Then he sees their friends Odette and her husband Jean Baptiste.
Any luck?
I have to go out to get food.
To Rutagunda's place. It is close by.
I have to, Tatiana, we are only as valuable as the service we provide.
We are almost out of water.
Twelve are dead.
Out? Where are you going?
Easy. You've got to keep still for a bit, the last thing we need is a coronary.
Convinced all those that needed convincing: you're an official dead lady.
Still alive, but it's just a matter of time. And then will come your miraculous resurrection --
"But you didn't, Ma'am. We have all these witnesses that saw..." well, whoever it ends up being that finally shoots him --
-- or might turn out to be -- very big surprise -- that Jenzen girl. The little bitch has the right stuff. She nearly put a bullet in Price right after your "demise."
It's complicated. But don't worry --
Not yet.
-- Price killed her, there's no other explanation --
-- bullshit --
Something just must've...frightened her, that's all.
Even if I were inclined, I've had better -- and a lot safer -- opportunities to kill off a wife.
Excuse me?
-- I did: down here.
New wrinkle on an old theory for treating schizophrenia. 19th Century, I think: what would drive a sane man mad should make a madman sane. The Vannacutt version was: bombard the patient with aural and visual stimuli far more frightening than any hallucination they could ever produce, it'd traumatize 'em back to "normalcy."
Pritchett!
And you're not really as large and useless as you seem.
-- you lose either way, Price --
Don't think it's even an issue.
So, what? The thing with the glass? Price did that?
-- asking the wrong guy -- wasn't me who closed it.
Huh. And here I had a completely different theory.
Oh, no-no-no -- much more bang for everyone's buck to nail the bitch --
I don't know, Ms. Jenzen.
Messenger just dropped it off. No return address.
I was in the middle of --
I'm ready now.
Jennifer-Jenzen-Executive-V.P.- Paragon-Pictures.
-- listen to me, goddamnit --
Won't do any good.
Please.....anyone....help me?
For the love of God....please...?
Sara...?
Something....happened --
It looks delicious...
Mommy, the leprechauns drank the milk last night.
Where are we going to go, mommy?
What about all my other stuff?
Look daddy!  It's empty!
What's the matter?
Oh come on...
What will Aubrey think?
The heater's here.
No.
Oh my God where is she!
Are you all right?
Is white meat all right for you, Mr. Shea?
Concentrate!  She can hear you!
What...amulet?
Do you have any other physical evidence, that we can look at?
Hello?
Hold on.  Hold on, please.  I need talk to you.
Great.  Thanks.  You gonna have one?
But I don't know what's going on.
Yeah.  I found it.  I knew held like it and I figured ...
No.  JP.  My last boyfriend?  He like owns the club.  You know?  You were there?  He bought the statue.
... Let it define you.  Whatever it is. Most of the roses die behind the bar. This is the first I've given out for nearly a month.
You see, we're not so dissimilar.
You're saying you want us to beat them to the crystal and save the world from financial disarray.
Well, forget about it.  Hawk and I are going to Rio.  We're hurt, we're tired, and a hero ain't nothing but a sandwich.  Right, buddy?...
I didn't know how to tell you.  A couple brokers stopped in for Stoley Spritzers one night.  Next thing I know Fast Track Digest votes us "Watering Hole of the Month."  Now, I'm shopping for Aqua Salmon wallpaper.
They record everything their video surveillance takes in...
You bastard.  You fucked my freedom for a lousy job.
No sweat, Alex, you only made the biggest mistake of <u>my</u> life.  What was your per-diem?
I'm a ghost.  Boo.
With all due respect to that great blouse, why didn't I cut out her heart?
Oh, the shit is going to hit the fa--
This is bueno.  They had the worst ketchup in prison.....uh...
I was the Warden?
Let's just say, I never saw E.T.
You better believe I can.  I'm sick of people telling me what I have to do.
Selfish attitude?  I'm just some guy who wants a little nap and a cappuccino for when he wakes up, not too much foam...
How many times do I have to say it?  I didn't put the hit on Little Eddie... Never had anything against that kooky chimp.  I actually found him, "endearing."
So, Captain Hawk, in one of your paws you got a gold bar worth about 8 thou.  In the autre, you got lead that won't get you gelato.
Why do you show your parole officer such disrespect? Especially after I got you such a nice job.
Big girls don't cry-I-eye.
Damnit, I hate this!  I'm a cat burglar!  Nobody said anything about this fight-to-the-death shit.
Something short.
Snappy.
The Shazzammeter!
About seven minutes.
-- these were the values that were instilled in me while I was growing up in a little town you've probably never heard of --
Sid found me the icepack.
Thanks. People seem to be pretty hot over this imbecile story.
...You son of a --
Whatever! It's no dig on you, Archer, but this story is hot and you're no longer on top of it. Why, it's the scoop of the century -- the other papers won't have the Gunderson dope 'til tomorrow -- The Allemeinischer Zeitung, Le Figaro, they'll be choking on our dust come mornin' --
...What's your pleasure, buddy?
Forty-four, the top brass floor say, buddy! What takes fifty years to get up to the top floor and thirty seconds to get down?
I'm sorry, buddy... I'm sorry...
-- So we'd gone out to the Hamptons and the garden was in positive ruins!
But --
Finally.
She's got other problems, of course...
...adenoids.
I think you need some help.
Does she suffer?
Don't worry.  I wasn't missed.  The only important man here is the owner.
Yes, the redoubtable Paul.  He has the plantation, and I, as you must have noticed, have all the charm.
She's dead.  The dead ought to be buried.
You know what she is!  That's death -- no mind, no senses -- no love, no hate, no feeling -- nothing!
I suppose so.  Yes.
I've never given it much thought.
You think I love Jessica and want her back. It is like you to think that -- clean, decent thinking.
But I assure you, Father Walters, Miss Connell had no idea of the consequences when she went there.
And speaking of which, you have those market share charts Mr. Shackley was asking about?
Ben you know that's your territory - and I wouldn't dream to trespass - you're the expert. Hey, how do you think Paramount's gonna do with that Blatty novel, what's it called? The Exorcist?
Brilliant. Hey, you heading out a little early today?
Right o'.
Oh yeah. Musk, or something. You like it?
Oh lord. You think I'm so dense. And now you want to be seen with your dense wife at the cocktail party. You want to wear that ridiculous shirt which doesn't go with those pants at all. You want to wear that, and you want me to shake hands with your friends and make conversation and dress up in an outfit that shows a lot of cleavage and you're not going to accord me the respect of talking honestly about this... You don't really know what this feels like.
So how's school treating you?
Classes?
Grades?
Anyone special? You know...
Well it's good to see you -- we miss you around the house and all, but this St. Peter's, it's top of the line, eh?
Oh jeez, Benjie. Well, here you are.
What are you talking about?
Your toes cold?
Good shit.
It's what?
You want to come in, get a cup of coffee -- warm up? I can either walk you home, or you could crash in the guest room.
Thanks again. For the dinner.
I used to know how to cook.
Arise and shine, young Hood.
No candy for me?
I'm in love with Libbets Casey.
It's beyond mere physical attraction.
Truly? Do speak.
How do you know this shit?
You think Francis is going to beat me to the punch here?
Maybe we can mess around. You know, only if you want to...
Why did you -- with Sandy?
Well, you can...
All my model planes.
They were old. And they couldn't fly anyhow. I'm going to get a radio-controlled airplane at Christmas, and then I'll stuff it full of m-80s and then fly it into Mrs. Burgess's English class and blow it up.
Didn't want to miss anything.
Good.
Guess that's what they call Alaskan hospitality.
But here's the thing.  I retraced your exact steps according to your statement. You couldn't have seen Detective Eckhart from there.  I mean, not in that fog.
How much closer would you say you were?
No.
No.
We'll talk when we get back to Seattle.
You know my plan of action.
That's right.
He's asking everybody questions.
He's just rattling your cage.
One of your cases?
You want me to take you somewhere?
No.
Wild card.
I was waiting for you...
Your melancholy eyes...
Stop pestering me then!
We're immortal. You've always known that.
You never talked to me like that - in all these years.
Are they my kind Louis? Dolls never change either.
Do you think I would let them harm you?
Love holds you to me. And we are in danger, not you.
What do you want from me?
Come, you're going to feed now.
Have you ever been caught?
The girl, Lestat -
Claudia, Claudia, listen to me. You're ill, my precious and I'm going to give you what you need to get well.
I have to go now Lestat...
Shall we go on?
Yes.
Listen to me. He's here.
I thought you were out of town!
He's not coming. I thought he was just...
But, he said he'd try.
He does work hard.
You get any sleep at all?
I know I don't want to stay in here.
Ray, I can't...
You're the most beautiful woman in the bar tonight, Jules.
This was not my idea.
Estes came after me with a gaffing hook.
Guess the capital of Brazil --
Julie, is everything cool? Karla said...
Don't really have the market for something like this...  I can go two...two-fifty.
I'm just saying what all of you are thinking. It's bad enough gettin' rained out without having to hold her hand the whole time.
I took it for granted you gentlemen were refugees as are my other guests.
The ancient Greeks had just as good an explanation -- that the gods sent the plague to punish mortals for harboring Vrykolaka --
Perhaps I had better stay. I am tired.
I know it must be hard. But you have relatives in London --you've got a whole world of living, ahead of you --
What are you doing?
Come, Thea, if you're going to claim him as your father you've got to make up your mind. They'll be leaving any minute.
Woman, what are you doing here?
He sleeps quietly. He died with a wine glass in his hand -- he died laughing -- a brave man, Drossos, like his father before him.
You are a happy man Oliver. You have but one world to live in - the world of today. I have two worlds. I have that old dark world of peasant ignorance and superstition in which I was brought up and a new world which the army gave me  a world of mathematics, gun ranges,logistics, tactics, strategy.
I will be glad to leave this island. It has too much of that old dark world about it. I will be glad to leave it and that girl 
Theodosia --
I'm not crying, Mr. Potter.
Bert, now listen to me. Ernie, will you take me over to my mother's house? Bert, listen!  It's that fellow there  he says he's an angel  he's tried to hypnotize me.
What did you say?
You see, George, you were not there to stop Gower from putting that poison into the . . .
Where? I don't see a thing.
I want the Board to know that George gave up his trip to Europe to help straighten things out here these past few months. Good luck to you at school, George.
On V-J Day he wept and prayed again.
Oh, oh. Sam Wainwright! How are you? When did you get here?
Old college graduate now, huh?
He's gone. Don't worry. His name is Welch. He don't come in to my place no more.
No . . . No . . . No. . .
Father, did I act like that when I graduated from high school?
We have that all figured out. You see, Harry'll take my job at the Building and Loan, work there four years, then he'll go.
Well, no younger than I was.
How's that?
Oh, well, you know what I've always talked about  build things . . . design new buildings  plan modern cities  all that stuff I was talking about.
Oh . . . me? Oh, well, I feel funny enough already, with all these kids.
Violet Bick!
George, was it a nice wedding? Gosh, I wanted to be there.
You wouldn't mind living in the nicest house in town, buying your wife a lot of fine clothes, a couple of business trips to New York a year, maybe once in a while Europe. You wouldn't mind that, would you, George?
Oh, yes, George Bailey. Whose ship has just come in  providing he has brains enough to climb aboard.
Oh, confound it, man, are you afraid of success? I'm offering you a three year contract at twenty thousand dollars a year, starting today. Is it a deal or isn't it?
Sure, sure, sure. You go on home and talk about it to your wife.
In the meantime, I'll draw up the papers.
Well, hello.
Well, I don't.
Me?
Ouch!
Where are we going?  Look at this. There's the kitty, Ernie. Here, come on, count it, Mary.
Mary! Mary!
For me...?
Bring her to port a little.  That's it -- steady.
Your dad must be really pissed.
But we had it!  We were headed right for it!
You coming up on him?
I never heard of a 908.
Diver's camera.  Tom Andrews brought it up from under that abandoned cruiser.
Rich people.  Home port is Newport, Rhode Island.
Untie that rope.
Pop....
Fantastic lady.  Don't know what I'd do without her.
Y'know, Brody -- for the first time in years it's worth putting money into this town.
Length, 22 feet, 8 inches.
The what?
The whale's mouth?
Let's get the kid home.
Thank you.  I'll tell him.
Sort of -- Mathew Hooper is aboard the research vessel Aurora, presently in the Antarctic Ocean, and won't be in radio range until half-past next spring.
What're you doing?
Affirmative.  Can you get your chopper airborne?
Get him the hell over to Amity Point, the old lighthouse.  Right now.
There's a bunch of Kids day-sailing that way.  Turn them back to port.
That's it.  Just do it, all right?
If they're not at the light, look for them.  I don't want them out there.  Get them back to port!
Is that me?
Mike!  Are you going out?
The wind drift is lateral.
Be careful....
I thought you were grounded.
They're turning around.
Oh, my God....
I don't understand.  Overman's too good a diver to disappear.
Damn it.  I can't understand!  I gotta go, hon.
Yeah.
What's wrong?
Kathryn...
Calvin wants me to move the White for tomorrow.
It's too soon to move him.
I did.  He wants it on exhibit.
Michael, you don't have to go down there.
You don't have to prove anything.
Lunch for Whitey.  Something to munch on in case things get dicey.
Let's hope he knows that.
Why?
He's big as a bloody bus!
Kelly, could you look after Sean for a while?  Show him around for me?
Sean, do you have herpes?
Ahhh, ahhh...
Gotta sneeze.
Filter system number four.  Is it large enough?
Took it this morning.
Thea....
Where are you going?
I take out the garbage, because...I'm glad we got that straightened out....
It'll grow on you.
Sweet breezes...Sweet women....
The fish.  Check it....
Your father was six then.  Just like you....
Sit down, Ma....
I'll be all right, Michael.
You looked just like your father... The first time the shark came to Amity....
It's a terrible thing to know some- thing no one else wants to believe.
Sometimes I think I'm going crazy. The nightmares....
It was no accident....
A drink with an umbrella in it....
I tried to tell you...I tried....
I hope she's a good sailor....
Mind if I cut in?  Your date's lonely....
She has good days and bad...I don't know....
I wish there was something I could do....
Would you talk to her?  She's got it in her head that the shark came for him.  She still blames it for my father's death....
Sharp shirt, Jake....
What for?  We've got a job to finish ...Why are you making the monitor?
Bring her about.  We're headed in the wrong direction....
Half don't...Bring her about....
He gambles...He likes a good time...I see him around....
What the hell are you doing?
She's in management....
Manage the whole damn place some day. I'm looking forward to living in the style to which I would like to become accustomed....
I dunno .. Guess the dozer musta shifted him? You need some hands up here to look ..
Not today .. I'm on a diet to- day .. I'll take a diet soda ..
Why don't you dump it? Mail it off. Give the fucking F.B.I. a present?
Because I dislike her too much ..
You believe me, don't you?
That's a very stupid question, Ross.
Bull shit .. I'm in my prime ..
What do you want me to do, Chief?
Did he get you the job?
As recent as we have .. What ex- actly is your interest in Amber?
Then what are you hoping I'm gon- na do? Dissuade, or persuade you?
Have you been here long?
I'm sorry. I'll get my things.
I know what you're like ..
Ross told me.
He said you're quite chubby. And you have a nervous tick.
Just your age.
I think they're gonna arrest me.
How you doing on those shoes?
She married some English prick.
I think I found some- thing horrible, Sir
I know.  Sorry I threw a scare into our lives there --
Well, no you didn't --
I did the 23 hour nose-route to the top of El Capitan in 6 hours! I can make this work.
Look, Rod, just get on the camel!
And I guess we didn't talk about money.  So, I'll just dive in --
Hey you.
I'm working with you because of that memo...
Yeah.  It wasn't like my marriage to Roger was so great, even before --  Jerry?
Why do you love me?
He just lost his best client.  He called from the plane.  I invited the guy over.
Oh yes.  Jerry Maguire!  My agent! This is a fierce, loving individual, I love this man, he is love, he is about love -- my ambassador of kwan.
Good, 'cause see, I am a valuable commodity.  I go across the middle. I see the ball and a dude coming right at me, wanting to kill me, I tell my brain "get killed, catch the ball." That's New York Steak, baby.  Rare. And yet, nobody's giving me LOVE. Nobody's giving me PROPS.  Nobody. I went to Arizona State, I'm from Arizona, I break Arizona records, I'm a Sun Devil, man!!!
Rod --
What are you doing with me, Rod?
Do your job, man, don't tell me to dance.
You never had The Talk, did you?
I have to ask.
Marcee, things are changing around here.  You and Rod will have my total personal attention.
Aw shit...the crowded restaurant... so there's no scene...
I won't tell.
After what you've seen today, you really think your son could be alive?
We can't just...
Udesky.
My own kid was right in front of me and I didn't do a damn thing.
I should have tried. It should have been me on that beach back there, not Billy.
He could have died.
Where's Dad?
You rented an automated litter box.
We need to keep moving.
When I met you, I thought that one day millions of years ago, all the dinosaurs became extinct. Wiped out. But you told me otherwise. When conditions changed, dinosaurs changed. They became other things. They evolved.
We climb down to the barge and follow the river out to the ocean. With any luck, the Costa Rican coast guard will pick us up.
Hmmm.
Billy!
Is there an antidote?
But he's the head of InGen!
How could you possibly?
You rally think this'll draw the parent?
Killing lessons?  Heartwarming.
It's... behind... us.
Do you see any family resemblance here?
Something's wrong.
No!  We're an independently funded expedition.
-- way we could safely --
If we can't stay in the rex's territory, we have to move tonight.
Woah, woah, woah, what the hell, what the hell?
Fences are failing, all over the park!  A few minor systems, he said!
Oh, I'll get 'em all.
Sure.  I've got a gas powered jeep.  I can drop her at the visitor's center before I make the boat with the others.
This is just a delay, that's all this is.  All major theme parks have had delays.  When they opened Disneyland in 1956, nothing worked, nothing.
The movement!
Elm that's it, it explains the periodicity, the - -
Alan?!
No.
Yes?
John, we - - what I'm just saying....
I threw up.
I can't!  I'm scared!
Their radio's out too.  Gennaro said to stay put.
Well, I didn't ask.  Why wouldn't they be?
What's to be scared about?  It's just a little hiccup in the power.
I didn't say you were scared.
Blood temperature feels like high eighties.
It's safe?
It's safe.
C'mon Tim, move down, damn it!
You don't give us our due credit.  Our scientists have done things no one could ever do before.
But this is nature!  Why not give an extinct species a second chance?!  I mean, Condors. Condors are on the verge of extinction - - if I'd created a flock of them on the island, you wouldn't be saying any of this!  have anything to say at all!
I don't understand this Luddite attitude, especially from a scientist.  How could we stand in the light of discovery and not act?
I'm sorry - - I'm sorry - -
Hello?
Structure might be salvageable... let's see what the interior looks like.
I can't wait to hear your opening argument. "Ladies and Gentlemen of the Jury... the Defense will prove that Jason Voorhees did not kill all of these people. They, in fact, committed mass suicide and then buried themselves in his back yard..."
Sorry.
I don't believe it. Jason's mother died of ovarian cancer in 1969.
Krueger... doesn't ring a bell.
Fascinating.
If I'm right, this happened before the Krueger murders in Springwood.  That means that Jason might've been Krueger's first victim.
Where do you live?
I've read your stories.  They're fantastic.
Just what you've published.
I read the one about the penal colony.
The keeper of the files is still waiting for your final summation of the Erlanger claim.
You didn't give it to <u>me</u>.
Did you see him?
He's usually in the storage room sorting things out.  He can't close the file on a case until he has the concluding report.
I'm Kafka -- I work upstairs in Accident --
You're a friend of Eduard Raban's.
Oh -- well, I thought he once mentioned --
-- I don't know the Musil district.
Of course he is -- the Castle precincts are not the safest part of the city after dark.  People disappear up there regularly.   If you want to lie in wait for someone, that's the place to do it.
How often does one of our clerks have business in the house of records?
And Burgel is the bringer of messages, isn't he?
You told me to contact you if anything relevant came up -- Gabriela is relevant.  When I spoke to you before I didn't know she'd been seeing Eduard.
That's <u>mad</u>.
The fact that it's live bodies you practice your trade on doesn't seem to matter to you.
Women are all you have on your mind!
I'm coming onboard! Throw down a ladder!
There's no hard feelings, Mr Denham! I just want to come to the island with you!
Father It's somewhere south-west of here - we need to inform the museum ...  organize an expedition -
There's a light up ahead.
I guess that answers your questions. There's no island on these co- ordinates - not even a lousy fog-bank.
Holy shit! Look at the size of that!
It must have been terrifying?
All right. Loneliness.  Well -- separated. From other people. Forgotten.  Well, as if I can be here, I can go through the motions, right? But the truth is, I don't belong.
Do you always have to repeat?
Well it's more than loneliness. Hate. People hating me -- and watching me and following and waiting to hurt me -- you know? I'm all screwed up.
The truth is I hate them: they must hate me. All right, the money.  All right, not the money. A kind of put-on. It gets things back together.  Well let's say I'd go to one of these cattle-calls, a tryout. I mean before -- before I got this job -- and they'd always say thank you very much and i'd feel, you know, brought down. They didn't want me.
What about?
You said that.
I have some names the police gave me. Frank Ligourin. Will you tell me what --
I thought you were going back to the apartment.
The next few weeks I would like to know where you are all the time.
Just let me know when you are going out and where --
How can you do it to yourself?
Ligourin: How could you do it?
You're right, I don't understand. Explain it to me.  You were scared. Arlyn Page, that scared you. Well it should; that's death. So what did you do, you ran straight for it, death. Ligourin kills women.
No, no you're right, I'm sorry. He uses women; he lets them kill themselves. Is that how you want it?
No, you can find some other way.  Explain it to me. Bree, show me any sense to --
Ah, Schmendrick -- what's the scam?
She wouldn't be reliable anyhow -- a narcotics addict.
I've always respected Bree.  I'd like to make something clear.
Well?
Where is the child?
When is mommy coming back?
Mom, I mean dad...
That's not the right soap.  We use the kind in the green and yellow box.
I want my...mm...ommy...I want mmmy...mommy...
Objection.  You're leading the witness.
Billy, sometimes when a mother and a father are divorced, there's a discussion about who the child should live with, the mother or the father.  Now there is a man who is very wise.  He's called a judge.  And a judge has a lot of experience with divorces and he decides who it would be best for the child to live with.
Because...Well, that's what he does.  He's a very powerful man.
Bigger than a principal.  The judge sits in robes in a big chair.. The judge has thought a lot about us, about you and me and your mom, and he has decided...  ...he has decided that it would be best for you to live with your mom Joanna in her apartment.  And I'm very lucky.  Because even though you'll live with your mom Joanna I'll get to see you once a week for dinner and a couple of weekends a month.
What don't you understand, pal?
At your mom's.  She'll have a bed for you in your own room.
I'll send your toys there and I'm sure you'll get some new ones.
Your mom.
Your mom knows all about The Face, okay?  Don't worry, she'll tell The Face to beat it.
Objection.
Ted was a good worker.  But, ah... ... after his wife left him and he was taking care of the kid on his own, things started to change. Look, I know he had problems, I understand that.  I've got problems, everybody's got problems.  But I've got a shop to run, I can't let that kind of thing get in the way...  I guess I felt that Ted was letting his duties at home interfere with his responsibilities in the office.
I thought you might just like to know that at five-fifteen this afternoon we were officially handed the Fire and Ice account by Revlon.
He looks like a terrific kid.
Watching my son...Ted, I've been living in New York for the past two months.
Ted...The reason I wanted to see you...I want Billy back.
I want my son.  I'm through sitting in coffee shops looking at him from across the street. I want my son.
Ted, listen to me...You and I, we had a really crappy marriage--  Look, don't get so defensive, okay?  It was probably as much my fault as it was yours... Anyway when I left I was really screwed up--
Ted, all my life I'd either been somebody's daughter or somebody's wife, or somebody else's mother. Then all of a sudden, I was a thirty-two-year-old, highly neurotic woman who had just walked out on her husband and child.  I went to California because that was about as far away as I could get.  Only... I guess it wasn't far enough. So I started going to a shrink.  Ted, I've had time to think. I've been through some changes. I've learned a lot about myself.
Jesus Christ.  That's a real blockbuster.  I always figured you guys had it made.
And?
Mr. O'Connor called.  There's a meeting with the Revlon people in the board room and you're fifteen minutes late.
Mr. Schmidt can't have the figures on the television buy until Monday.
Mr. Lombardo from packaging wants to meet on Friday.
Good Christ, Joanna, just get the hell out of my life.
Yeah.
Don't worry.  I plan to have something within twenty-four hours, John.
What are you going to do?
I mean, what are you going to do about Billy?
Look, this is nothing personal, but I don't think you can do it.
Hey, that's terrific.
And that day, your father got better. He named you Lhamo. "The Protector."
Have you heard the terms of the Seventeen Point Agreement?
Your Prime Ministers, support the proposal that you return to Lhasa. On the opposite hand, some officials urge you not to return. They believe you should leave now, for India.
You can't do anything real until you are Dalai Lama.
Quite simple. Yes. Good.
I have always asked for plain information. Just the truth.
I have been greatly impressed by your accomplishments. Industrial progress. Great efficiency. Your people are capable and courteous.
I want to go down there.
I want to run down the street. I want to buy a toy. Eat from the shops.
I want to be a shepherd, taking those goats and cows out to the hillside.
Maybe in the next life, the world will not need a Dalai Lama.
You are in great danger. The Dalai Lama cannot fall into Chinese hands. You must flee.
Oh, my husband passed away almost two years ago.
<u>Please</u>.  I'll have sex with you, anything, but get out of the water.
You listen to me.  The only reason I'm letting you be part of this is 'cause you got the helicopter and the radar--
I do <u>not</u> like you.
Asia?  How... how could he get here?
Let's not overlook he didn't eat me, maybe--
<u>No</u>.  Look.  He's got nothing left.
<u>Jack</u>!
Kelly Scott.
Baby crocs?
If one could be out there... why does Fish And Game tell me it's impossible?
Hard to believe there could be a monster under such peacefulness.
I'm gonna get ticks.  I know it. They're drawn to me.  I got a thing about ticks.
What?
Watch out!!
Different worlds, Jack.
No.
You think?
Even if we <u>could</u> tranq him-- how would we get him on land.
<u>What</u> <u>is</u> <u>that</u>?
Is this 'spose to make me take him more serious?
Why does everybody insult my intelligence, I have intelligence, intelligent people eat Twinkies.
What is she doing <u>now</u>?  <u>Mother</u> <u>of</u> <u>God</u>.
I was working for you when "us" started, what's--
Kevin, as long as we...  What was that last part?
Yeah, that part.  There's... somebody who's um...
Phone call, Clarice. It's God.
Jack's pretty tough on you, isn't he? Impatient...
He gave us a perfectly good description, and we're on it now, so we won't be needing your little novelty act any longer - or his, either. He's under close guard at the courthouse, pending a prison transfer. The next plane, Officer.
Mrs. Lippman had a son, maybe he could help you. I have his card somewhere. Do you mind stepping inside, while I looks for it?
Talk about him, Starling. Tell me what you see.
Why?
Why not?
Maybe you've got a knack for this... I guess we're about to find out.
I lied to Lecter. I'll need some kind of peace offering... Can I get the drawings from his cell?
Mr. Crawford... can those cops down there handle Dr. Lecter?
Is that a pretty good job, FBI agent?
You get to travel around and stuff? I mean, better places then this?
I was your choice, Dr. Lecter. You chose to speak to me. Would you prefer someone else now? Or perhaps you don't think you can help us.
By the book, he's a sadist.
Yes.
They all were.
She had an insect deliberately inserted in her throat. That hasn't been made public yet. We don't know what is means.
A moth... How did you predict that?
What did you do?
Her name is Kimberly Jane Emberg, she was just ID'd. I met her on a slab in West Virginia. And sometime tomorrow, or tomorrow night, he's going to do the same thing to Catherine Martin.
My God, you've grown up.
Yes, miss.
Much further?
Will you go back to England?
Cora, I adore you and, when we come together, we will be the happiest couple in England...  I am certain of that. More than ever before.  I believe you must trust the judgment of others who hold your welfare so close to their hearts...
I owe you gratitude or I'd call you out!
That we did. John. But the horicane  is near trapped out.
Yes, Mr. Poe? So?
Webb's not in Albany. He marched the 33rd to Fort Edward two days ago.
Yes, sir.
Sergeant Major!
Thank you, Sergeant Major. Thank the men.
Is the hatchet buried between the English and my French father?
Not a warrior has a scalp and the white men become friends.
Magua took the hatchet to color it with blood.  It is still bright. Only when it is red, then it will be buried.
Where is that sun?! It has gone behind the hill.  It is dark and cold. It has set on his people, they are fooled and kill all the animals and sell all of their lands to enrich the European masters who are always greedy for more than they need.  And Le Subtil is the son of his tribe. There have been many clouds and many mountains. But now he has come to lead his nation.
What do you want me to say? That it all sounds mysterious?
Doc eat already?
I hit it.  But I can't see it!  Can you see it?!
That was a loud one wasn't it?
We made it!
I'm going inside.
Twenty minutes...
Well, according to Maritime law, you, as commander of the Shack have the authority to dispose of the body.  However, the company doesn't want you to do that.
But you don't have any proof at this point to assume that this disease is contagious, do you?
Beck, trust me.  If the company felt that you or your crew were in any danger we would authorize an immediate emergency pickup. We could be there in a few hours.
Who else...Sixpack.
So that's all you do?...
You guys are crazy.  What the hell you play that stupid game for?
You're on your way somewhere all right...the looney bin.
Look.  Water.
What is it?
Don't spend all day down there.
How much did you part with?
Because it's cheap like a budgie.
The traffic warden went to the morgue and recognized Dog and his lot so that put us sort of in the clear. They got no case against us because there is no evidence against us.
Er, very nice Harry. What's it for?
Hello, John. Nice holiday?
Who was that?
Jesus, I have heard about him.
What the fuck did you do to Fauntleroy?
Invitations.
Yeah invitations, you know a pretty white piece of paper with your name on it.
All right, just you; the others can wait in Samoan Jo's next door.
Well, what's going on?
You and me, Tom.
I'll see ya.
Unless you are going to accept twenty quid.
Jesus, if I pick them up, will they stay in one piece? Where did you get them from?
They look nice, I agree . . . but lacking in criminal credibility, aren't they? I might get laughed at. How much do you want for these muskets?
What's left over?'
If you had your way I wouldn't have any friends.
Just 'cause I'm not like Little Miss Honor Roll here--
It's not our job to get involved in your personal life, but when it interferes with the training here--
You uhm--you remember what old Buddy carried for a side arm?
A .45--
Just wondering.
If it was some poor mojado, swam across at night, got lost in the scrub and starved out there, we wouldn't go any further. But this is a formerly prominent citizen.
What I will do is keep names out of it till we got some answers or hit a dead end. You know how the press is with a murder story--even if it's forty years old.
You've been in this house for a while?
I never met her.
Dad, I talked to the track coach--
I have a B average.
The Sheriff says we shouldn't touch anything,
Treasure hunter?
So.
This is an official visit, then--
Como se llama? [What's your name?]
Big day coming up--I wish we'd have thought of it while he was still living. But he went so unexpected.
Which is why we need to talk to you about the new jail--just so we're all on the same page.
That's a matter of interpretation--
You don't remember anything else from that last night you saw him, do you?
Bledso
He still living?
There was a mandate in the last election--
Oh--I think he came in one more time with Hollis and--naw, your Daddy wasn't with them. Made their monthly pickup. Roderick wasn't in so I just kept my mouth good and shut and handed over that envelope.
Could of been. That was white people's business.
What about it?
That's how I ruined my stomach.
He was afraid I was going to poison somebody. Your father tried to do good for people--
And your mother was a saint. That summer I built the patio at your house? She made me lunch every day.
So why did you come back here, Sam?
You don't want to be Sheriff.
It can happen so sudden, can't it? Being left out on your own.
We start from scratch--
Hey Sam. Sorry 'bout that.
We had about a dozen wets come over just upriver. They ran into one of our posts--it was like a breakshot on a pool table, illegals runnin' every which way.
We'll get 'em--  So you livin' out here now?
I heard about that deal for your father--You must be real proud.
Yeah?
How much?
Hokey enough for you?
I don't want him getting in the way.
He's with us...
I didn't marry him for love, Mr. D'Amour.  Tonight?
So Swann was performing magic. not illusions?  And what?  You thought he should be using it to cure cancer, not making millions.
Too much fame.  Yeah, I guess that'd turn anybody's head. Including yours.
You said you weren't with him for love.
What then?
No!  No!  No!
Bad show last night?
... they believe you.
Sure.
Oh God.
I'm not saying another word.  You damn fool.  He's a journalist.
I want to speak to Dorothea.
You need an ambulance.
You know, it's such a fucking waste.  You can do shit most of us can only dream about, and you go around pretending it's some trick.
Or murdered, like Nix.
Maybe he doesn't see it that way. Maybe he's digging his way out of the hole you put him right now.  That's what you're hiding away from, isn't it?
Oh yeah?
This is where we killed him.
And?
You really are having a mid-life crisis.
Hans was very attentive to you.
No, its easy.
What happened to your toe?
When are you leaving?
I'm going to miss you.
Yeah, its really different here.
It's four in the morning... I'm going to go to sleep.
I love you, too, good-night, or good- morning .
How'd it go today?
Will you please stop smoking?
Its bad for you.
...doing like twenty million interviews a day... It's soo good to see you. How long are you here for?
It's amazing  there!
Oh, Peter, you're going to pursue this.
She's been stalking you, Peter.
When your secretary called, she made no mention of her coming, too.
You're aware that this woman was party to the so-called exorcism.
How're you doing?  Looking lovely as always.
So I guess Satan lost.  Satan is the weak one.
So...what did you think of the tape.
What do you mean?
Do you know your parents' blood types?
Peter, your blood-type is AB negative. There's no way your birth father can be O positive.  You father is not who you think he is.
It'll happen at the exact time of your birth.
He was trying to tell me something.
But she worships you.  Your mother's dead but your father's alive.
So, Viznick's got a meet with his lawyer in the ayem.
Monica, what did you do?
What?
Which one for tomorrow?
You know, girl, long as I've lived next door, I've never seen the inside of this house.
My mouth is kinda dry.
That too tight?
Mom's going to hate it.
Like you don't give her a hard time.
What's up with that?
Thanks, Sidra.
Told you I was nice.  I'm going to be the first girl in the NBA.
Why she gotta be a ho, just cause she wants to get with me.
And?
So she's honest.
Didn't know you cared so much.
So who you going to the dance with, Spalding?
Four.
Kiss my booty.
You know what, I'm just gonna crash.
Just something I'm trying.
What's going on?
Zeke.
Quincy, I told you about these fat-ass girls.
I'm not playing with you, these girls are looking to get you caught.  They see you, they see dollar signs.
You hearing me?
Besides, the sooner you go pro, the sooner you'll have to deal with the mess I'm dealing with.
there's this thing out there.  This paternity suit.
Some girl that's been hanging on at every party.  now I'm supposed to be her baby's Daddy.  Anyway, I told your mom I wanted to be the one who told you.
I just told you.
You smell like trouble --
You ok?
What do you want? Why are you here?
For what?
--- yeah, yeah, I get in it in my ear. It's TMJ is what it's called technically.
No, what's wrong?
Let's go, c'mon, get up --
Did you listen to me?
-- I told you who did it and you're not listening to me.
It was the lovely Samuel Johnson who also spoke of a fella "Who was not only dull but a cause of dullness in others."
Picky, picky.
I've been a good worker --
...find him on the...Frank. His name's Frank Mackey --
Time's up.  Thank you for the interview.
So....Phil....um...I think I'm gonna step in and try and see him and say something if he can...talk...I mean:
Can you stand...back...maybe, I mean... just a little bit...in the room is ok, but back from us a little...
What the hell is this Marcie?
We are not on display.  I am not a doll. I AM NOT A DOLL...I' M NOT SILLY AND CUTE. I'M SMART SO THAT SHOULDN'T MAKE ME SOMETHING, SOMETHING SO PEOPLE CAN WATCH HOW SILLY IT IS THAT HE'S SMART?  I KNOW.  I KNOW THINGS. I KNOW. I HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM I HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM AND I HAVE TO GO.
...say it, Jimmy...
I'm asking you.  I'm asking you if you know why Clauida will not speak to you....please, Jimmy....tell me.
Was it a call back?
If we beat the record, you might get a call back --
You don't do that, you don't call him, you don't know to get involved in the bussiness of his, of his of <u>my</u> family. this is the <u>family</u>, <u>me</u> and <u>him</u> do you understand?  You understand? NO ONE ELSE. THERE IS NO ONE ELSE.  That man, his son does not exist.  HE IS DEAD.  HE IS DEAD and WHO TOLD YOU TO DO THAT?
Did you piss your fuckin' pants, Stanley?
I didn't I'm fine, I'm fine.
Oh God I -- Forgive me...
Louis, please -- !
What are they doing?
Now.  You were saying?
Look at us.  We are old men now.  But once we were young.  And when we saw injustice, we fought it.
Aramis... is this the way to hell?
Let's see you rob somebody with your pistol there!
"Phillippe has been removed to the Bastille, to the lower dungeon.  At midnight tonight I will order the guard changed, and will delay the replacements for ten minutes.  That should give you ample time.  Never have I needed more to say:  One for all, and all for one.  D'Artagnan."
Thanks, but not for me.
I have ordered a drill of the Royal Guard for midnight, and must be clear-headed for it.
They must stay sharp.  There was an attempt on the King's life today.
I heard your playing.
Recent hours have been a shock.
Phillippe... there is something I hope you understand.  Terrible cruelty has been used against you. And... you must understand that you did nothing to deserve it.
The desire for vengeance... can be a poison.
This place... I once lived in a country house.  I had guardians -- an old man and woman.  And tutors. But no friends.  Then when I was twelve, they came and took me to the prison.
A man in black.  I never saw his face.  He took me to the cell.  A blacksmith came and they put me into the mask.  For days I shouted, "What have I done?  Why do you do this to me?"  But no one heard, so I just stopped shouting.
I want all these passages sealed! Another stupid idea of my father's! Seal them all, every one!
Even the bedchamber passages!  Let none remain!
What number did you tear out?
What number, on the first page?
Majesty... We have more than enough food set aside for your birthday celebration next week.  If we distributed some of that, we would have time to gather more before --
Raoul... Oh, Raoul...
Bullshit...
Let's roll -
Alright, where is she?
Who am I?  I'm gonna be your worst fucking nightmare until you start breaking it down for me.  You understand? Where did you get the car!
Something I don't already know?
You know, you don't seem afraid of much either.  How do you know I'm not going to try to rape you?
You are drunk.  You know, it's been a long time and I'd love to catch up, but I really got to -
Just what did you get yourself into, Jimmy?
Jesus, man...
Donut?
I don't, but I'm pretty sure. It's a long story but I cloned a cellular linkup with a binary code scrambler and sent it through the phone network mainframe.  If they start a trace it will be to a Pic'n'Save on Pico.
I'm stranded out here.
What have we missed?
Willingham, when he tossed his cell, took Polaroids so they could get everything back in place...
Where?
A cat. We found a litter box downstairs but not the cat.  Neighbors are watching for it.
Run it.
It's the guard in the storeroom.
...but if we find him, the print as evidence will get a conviction, Hold on. What?
How did you come to Gateway?
Am I alone in this room? Are you here...  Why are you doing this?!
Look at the screen. That is William Blake's 'The Great Red Dragon and The Woman Clothed with the Sun.'  Do you see?
The consensus around here is that the only person who has demonstrated any practical understanding of Dr. Hannibal Lecktor is you, Mr. Graham. Can you tell me anything about him?
He's very strong physically.
He's white and six feet tall. You haven't told me anything yet.
I don't want to do that,
Molly, dear Molly. Go to bed now, baby...
Let's forget who said what to whom...
What kind of coffee do you like?
...if he's smart he'll approach from the front, pass, and take you from the back. How well do you hear?
I'm gonna spray your suit jackets. It'll be invisible in this light, but you'll stand out like a zebra for us.  They told me you checked out a .44 Charter Arms Bulldog.
You have to do it.
Hi, George!  Good to hear from you!
Hey!  Our first phone call!  Hello?
Did your -- doctor say it's okay for you to go back to work?
Really?
Five.
Ten.
Andy, the theater's that way!
Ooo, the little lady's upset.  Well I say -- get back in the kitchen!
T-there wasn't a reason to purposely hurt me --
My father said I should've gotten a lawyer --!
I was very original!
Look -- I gotta be clear with you. Tony Clifton is NOT Andy Kaufman.
No, I'm serious.  If you book Tony, do NOT EXPECT TO GET ANDY.
Yeah, he's just laying low, waitin' for his comeback.  God, listen to this!  "It was morally wrong to take advantage of such an unstable individual..."
JESUS CHRIST!!!!!
Lieutenant?
Lieutenant, you were given specific orders --
You ever have the feeling that you're not sure if you're awake or still dreaming?
But you're out, Cypher.  You can't go back.
Operator.
Hello?
Welcome, Neo.  As you no doubt have guessed, I am Morpheus.
Morpheus, what's happened to me? What is this place?
When?
I thought it wasn't real.
Listen to me, Neo.  I know why you're afraid to go through that door.  You can't get free of thinking that I could be wrong.  You must believe me.  There is a greatness inside of you, Neo.  A greatness that is going to lift you to unimaginable heights and that in time will change the world.
Hello?
You're the Oracle?
Yeah.
How did you do that?
Of what?
Who is?
What does that mean?
But an Oracle can.
Is it?
Should I be?
What are you doing?
You can't!
Morpheus sacrificed himself so we could get you out!  There's no way you're going back in!
What?
Holy shit!
Operator.
No, really, I liked it...thought it was great.
Well, we got $40, and we wanna buy...
No.
Listen, try a place with some sun. Swimming pools.  Palm trees.  Girls in little French bathing suits.
I don't think I should go home looking like this.  You think I could stay at your place tonight? Your mother's not there is she?
Keep your mouth shut.
Hello, Michael.  I've got something for you...not much...but...
...Charlie, don't you think you should be interested in Johnny's payments to me?  I think you should be, you know that.
I know that Charlie but look at my side.  You undersigned the loans. You vouched for him.  What happens if this kid don't pay me?  I gotta collect from you?  I don't want to do that.  I made a deal with him not you, right?
He could at least show some respect and show his face, even if he doesn't have the money...
About Oscar...I think he put on this act...about the restaurant being in bad shape and all that. He can't make the payments...I don't know what to make of it.  He says Groppi's run off with a girl. I could help if you want.
Well, maybe you missed something?
C'mon Charlie...one more day.  I'll call in sick for work.
Are you sure he didn't say anything to you about tonight?
How about me?  I don't get a drink John?
-- But he does seem very nice.
What, honey?
I know you do, darling.
Oh, you couldn't be more wrong, sweetheart.  I can' tell you how much I appreciate it and how I'm looking forward to it.
Honey, please.
What are you eating.
We're not getting anywhere here. Why don't we take some of the best out of this thing, let's consider it coolly, let's take a week --
Perhaps you could remind me.
Yeah, something he goes by --
Joe, cut it out.  And you too, Drew.
That's it?
The answer is no, quick enough for you?
I'm not interested in the details. And I'm not interested in the big picture either.  What I am inter- ersted in is how my Board got conven- ed behind my back, is entertaining a further proposal from a man whom it offends me to do business with, moreover has the audacity to present this to me like a prize fish, and I am expected to clap for it like a performing seal.  No, thank you.
Yes, you are to understand that, and now may I ask you a question?
I thought so, too.  Joe's a neat guy.
Don' be facety, woman.
No, I come to see Doctor.
Don't bother asking, we already tried.
'Big'?
I am Joe.
Joe, I'm with Drew.
You first.
...No.
The 'coffee shop' --
If there is anything else, don't hesitate --
How long have I got?
What's it like?
What's it like where I'm going?
Yes.
And more.
I couldn't sleep.
Susan wants to come.  She says she's in love with me.
No.
You are --?
Where are you?  Are you there?
Please.  Talk to me --
What do you mean?!
But he does give a shit.  Don't you, Bill?
Well, thank you, that's great, but it's more than I bargained for.  I just wanted to set the record straight.
I know it's a cornball thing but love is passion, obsession, someone you can't live without.  If you don't start with that, what are you going to end up with?  I say fall head over heels.  Find someone you can love like crazy and who'll love you the same way back.  And how do you find him?  Forget your head and listen to your heart.  I'm not hearing any heart.  Run the risk, if you get hurt, you'll come back.  Because, the truth is there is no sense living your life without this.  To make the journey and not fall deeply in love -- well, you haven't lived a life at all. You have to try.  Because if you haven't tried, you haven't lived.
Aw, you're tough.
That was wonderful.
Do you mind if I raise a little caution flag?
What is the nature of your interest in Joe?
Are you relieved?
Not at all.
I've got patients coming in --
78.
Should I wear it?
So how many rooms am I checked into in this dump?
Why?
Wait! Did he tell you what I was bringing?
Guess I don't have to worry about him anymore.
Give him some bruises of his own and tell him to look for a guy called Teddy.
My wife used to call me Lenny.
Yeah, I hated it.
* Depends on if he's here in town. Or if he's moved on. See, I've got all this -   *
Chronic alcoholism ~ one cause of short term memory loss.
My name's Leonard.        *
This is your car.
I don't think so.
Unfinished business.
Why?
My wife wasn't diabetic.
Bullshit.       *
She's sending a message.  Meth Lab. Trailer park.  Anything with interesting antenna arrays...?
I don't know.
I got to talk to my ADO...
My cousin is the harbor master. You must not bring in drugs.  You cannot be armed.  If you're carrying, it has to go.  Or stow it inside.  No one will go near your boat...
Hola, chica.
Jos...
What friend?
People gonna walk into this place and say, "Ola, hijo!  That some crazy wallpaper.  Whew...it wild! Is that a Jackson Pollack?"
Where the hell are you, man?
If we were for real, and knew our shit, we'd fade this one...
Control your men.
Oh, good...
You mean with the flowers...?
Conveyance?
I walk into Neptune's house...very nice.  But I also see you... and our drugs that got ripped from Maguda.
What you gonna do back there, East?
Yeah?
Must be some mess back there.
Ain't gonna collect your pay?
Cut it out. That's cheating, teasing me so I can't think. Just one bitsy Y word and I gonna beat you!
Beat your butt, you don't lemme think!
Listen, keep away from me, hear? You come near me again, I snatch you bald-headed!
Miami Beach is the only place for a real hustler. Florida has more rich chicks per square yard than any resort spot in the world. They lie out in their pagodas and pergolas waiting to grab the first jockstrap that passes.
Well, this thought just struck me. It wasn't too long ago I was washing dishes way the hell somewhere in Texas.
Now I'm here. I'm in New York City. Getting picked for things. Don't you see what I'm driving at?
Did I say that? Did I?  It don't say nothing about you...
But they picked me, right? So what I'll do, I'll just say, now look, you want me? Well, I don't go nowhere without my buddy here.
If you have to shiver, why don't you pull the blanket up more?
Keep the goddam blanket on.
Sounds like they knew you.
Am I tickled to find you, boy! Come on in and let's get a look at you. Turn around. Good strong back. You'll need it. So you want help -- take a seat, relax, tell me about yourself. Cowboy, huh?
Take it,easy, boy...  Seems to me you're different than a lotta boys that come to me. Most of 'em seem troubled, confused, but I'd say you knew exactly what you want.
But I'll bet you got one thing in common with them other boys. I'll bet you're lonesome.
The kids? Why are they...
Who?
Where you staying, Dad?
How do you like it?  Istanbul?
...are you with the Consulate?
New people sometimes get on his nerves.
What do you mean LIFE FOR FOR WHAT! FOR WHAT!
Goddamn Gastro's killing me.  Making me blind. Hey Billy!
Never was anybody like you...
What'd the Prosecutor say?
Peter...
There's some weird shit here.
Did you see the size of that thing?!
Is there a switch?
What are you putting that crap on me for?
Do you think we did the right thing?
Metaxonycha Godmani.
It's me. Can you hear me?
Oh, come on, come on!
What's this?
Must get lonely, living out here all by yourself.
When do you think the phone lines'll be back up? I have to call my daughter, and I should call New York and let my agent know I'm breathing.
You want to read it?
I have a hard and fast rule about who can read my stuff at this early stage--only my editor, my agent, and anyone who saves me from freezing to death in a car wreck.
For a while I thought I might go crazy.
I do believe the winters are getting shorter and shorter every year. People say it has something to do with the ozone layer. What do you think?
Yeah, well, it's a theory. Here's your Novril.  How does tuna casserole sound for dinner?
I'm sorry, Paul. This is all wrong, you'll have to do it over again.
Paul, it's not worthy of you. Throw it all out except for the part of naming that gravedigger after me. You can leave that in.
Paul, what you've written just isn't fair.
That's right--when I was growing up in Bakersfield, my favorite thing in all the world was to go to the movies on Saturday afternoons for the chapter plays...
I've never had meatloaf this good, what do you do to it?
Now don't fuss, Paul.
Virginia, when you're in this car, you're not my wife, you're my deputy.
People sure like those Misery books.
Yeah, I understand he's been up here the last six weeks.
I thought you were over it.
I said you're beautiful, Nyah.
Bellerophen?  No time at all once I've got it.
What are you talking about?
Where?
-- now here's the way it's going to work..Wallis, the shares outstanding are..
Billy.  I think we got a problem.  Nyah's on the wing.  Up early.  Billy, do you copy?
Do you know me?
No.  You just looked as if you did.
Oh.  Well.  I think that can be arranged.
Hola..
Not that it matter much but..I seem to recall you staying something like, 'I was hoping we could work together.'
Where do I meet you?
No.  Should I?
Not yet.  We did manage to pull any sensitive equipment and material out of our safehouse wreckage.
We think we've got our finger on the buyer.
Yes, I believe that's right.
You mean that leaves Miss Hall.
Nekhorvich specialized in recombining DNA molecules.  In the myth, Bellerophon killed Chimera, a recombinant monster with the head of a lion and the tail of a serpent who plagued the ancient world.  I think Nekhorvich has created a monster virus in Chimera and apparently the means to kill it in Bellerophon.
Luther, I'm looking at security.
To friends.
Satisfied?
They're dead.  Jim's dead.
What?
Kittridge...
Passport, visas - you know the drill. We'll work the exfiltration thru Canada, debrief you at Langley.  Throw the Prague police a bone, you know toss them a few suspects.  Follow me?
We've lost enough agents for one night.
Krieger <u>did</u> have the NOC list.
What makes you trust me?
I'm not letting this list get out in the open.
It's hard to tell.  I'm gonna have to be close.
Zero body count.
In position.  Jack open the door, let the package roll.
How was Chicago?
Jim...?
Twenty-six, twenty-seven.  So far so good.
Who's dead?
I don't wanna talk about it.
You haven't once said you like my dress.
Have you come from my brother?
Why?
You are going to marry my brother?
I have no life.
I have no life. My brother Johnny took my life from me.
Your blood.
Loretta.
I've got you.
What about Johnny?
So. Where are we sitting?
Ronny!
He's coming.
Is there anything you want to tell us, honey?
What about the wedding?
How near is she to death?
Then let's set the date.
Must it be so definite? Can't we just say that we will be married when I get back?
Alright. A month. In a month.
Yeah.
No.
Oh yeah. He's a sweet man. I wanna have a big church wedding, Ma. And a reception.
What about the moon?
No.
Listen, I gotta go. I'll take the deposit to the bank but I'll do the books tomorrow. I gotta go.
So.
Out. I don't know where. I was waiting up for my husband.
May I presume to ask you a question?
Do you have a girlfriend?
Temperature's dropping.
I guess you can't invite me in?
People home.
I'm a little cold.
We could go to my apartment. You could see how the other half lives.
I'm too old for me. That's my predicament.
We didn't know what to think. You were so weird yesterday, and then this morning, we go to the bank and no bag.
Look! To maintain Velocity, a swallow needs to beat its wings four hundred and ninety three times every second.   right?
Am I right?
We shall do no such thing ... let us pass!
Who are you who are so wise in the ways of science?
There!  Look!
Too late.
Come and see the violence inherent in the system. Help, help, I'm being repressed!
Oh, Did you hear that!  What a give-away.
Who approaches the Bridge of Death Must answer me These questions three! Ere the other side he see.
What is your name?
What is your quest?
What is your favorite colour?
I think I'll be all right to come with you, sir.
Really, I feel fine, sir.
Who are you?
The Castle Anthrax?
Er ... +      You are the keepers of the Holy Grail?
Look, it's my duty as a knight to try and sample as much peril as I can.
When you have found the shrubbery, then you must cut down the mightiest tree in the forest ... with a herring.
So?
I was just telling the woman how I feel, for God's sake.
I speak as I find, Archie.
My lips may give a message better of Christmas love than e'en this letter.  To my best friend, J.B. from his best friend, V.R.  Best friend!
Mr Disraeli.  Ma'am.
Have you met Mr Lyle?  He's in sugar...?
Mr. Carter, the Head Butler, sits there.
By whose authority?
Go inside at once.
The look on their faces when one walks into the room.  Still gives one a ridiculous thrill.
Surely --
Was there never ambition?
Then I envy yo.
To have achieved one's ambition, or to have reconciled oneself to its limits, is a lifetime's work.
For Her Majesty.
But yourself?  What about John Brown?
Prince Albert was going to build a bench here.  He thought it one of the best views in Osborne.
Am I not safe enough with you, John?
The threat from the Irish is greatly exaggerated, I'm sure.
Then they may read about me.
Is that not enough?
A distinct flushing around the cheeks. She was drunk, I tell you.
It's Mr Brown, ma'am.
He appears to be ... standing by his horse.
What do they want?
Thanks, Albert.  Think you could print up those schematics?
He thinks I'm "sublimating".
What do you mean by "weird"?
We have to find out what's happened to them. I think they're gone...
If they're sick, great.  But let's make sure.  Come on, Nick.
SLIP-STREAM.
I don't understand.  It wants us to play the game.  It's been taunting us ...
It can turn itself on, Alex!  It doesn't need a quarter.
And we've still got time left.  This was a piece of cake.
Listen to me, Alex.  These counselor's don't know anything.  They're full of shit. If you don't fit the pattern of the perfect kid, they freak.
So tell me you're okay, then.
Think!  I want to go to the City of Truth, and the Truth Teller is from there...but which one is which?  The liar...think!
I'm thinking!
It means she's screwed up.
We'd be happy to put her in the pile for considerations ... you'd be pleased to know there's quite a lot of interest in this role.
No, I don't.
My name is Rita.
Yes?
Number 17.
Okay... but just...just to see.
Okay.
Oh, no wonder I'm starving. I'm going to fix a sandwich. You want one?
You're so easy.
Yeah, what for?
So man, that's unheard of ... an accident like that ... who coulda foreseen that.
Well, not much Ed. Just doin' some stuff for this guy.
Hardly.
Oh, things aren't so bad. Gee, I hope you're not goin' to get in any trouble.
I'll do the standard research and have them in by midnight, pending any unforseen problems.
Come on, it works.
I... I .....
I wanted to let his family know....
It wasn't my fault. I was just part of a team. I was doing my job...
Just stop it. End it here.
Is it over ?
Hey, try swimming. It works.
Johnny, let's get the cleanup started.
That was rather.... disappointing.
I want more action. I want to see more ingenuity than that. I want to see the injured man out wit the machines !
I don't believe Ol' Bruce is having as much fun with this as he once did. He still insists on the "guests" being of the more nefarious type.
What about that time when the mail room kid was accused of stealing and we put him in the "Park" ? Wasn't that a computer glitch ?
That mail room kid was the longest lasting "guest" yet ! Maybe we can alter the computer records and make another "guest" from the more athletic of our staff.
So who are these people with the Boss ?
Look ! Look !
I don't know. Maybe we should watch the tape to be sure.
Come on, I'm serious. Look at Wilma. She's this frail little thing, and Fred, I mean Fred Flintstone is this BIG guy. He has to be hung like a horse, and THAT's why Wilma puts up with his B.S.
I think we should follow him...
Sweet Jesus I never dreamed I'd be glad to see Central Park at night.
Umm, where do you want this?
Give us a break. All you have to do is make a phone call.
Look, sergeant I know I said some things last time that I shouldn't have said at all but...
I'm sorry okay...we gotta find this guy because...he knew Vada's mom and he could tell her stuff that no one else knows.
Do what?
You want me to move?
She was talented, but honey I wish I could help you a little more, it's just that your mother and I had kind of a whirlwind courtship, she came to town with this traveling theater group, I proposed on our second date, two weeks later we were married and almost nine months later you were here and she was gone.
Oh, she's fine, she'll love her new room.
Are you the Hillary Mitchell who went to school with Maggie Muldovan?
And she saved it.
Do you have any pictures if her?
So she had you in jail, in Russia?
Vada what about you, who have you come up with?
Your mother?
They obviously have no sense of historical perspective either.
Vada.
If he has a heart attack you're carrying the body down yourself.
You mean,  this ring?
And I'm gonna use the movies when I give my report. Jeffrey says audiences love special effects.
She lives here too?
But...are you engaged or something?
Who knew that when I started working in the finest foreign car shop in LA, I would also find the light of my life.
You really think I look sexy in this smock?
Oh no, I, I...eh...I couldn't.
Well I'm sort of involved.
Let's just say I...eh...I'm involved.
Oh, well, I don't wear a lot of jewelry.
Lizt was my parents' favorite, they were Hungarian.
Did it hurt a lot?
Uhh, it's nice to meet ya. Uhh, we got burgers and hot dogs here if you'd care to join us?
It hurts, it hurts so bad, make it stop.
Does it make it easier to win?
What are you wearing?
Well, you were pretty great!
Daddy, how come that coffin's so small?
When??
I found this.
In the garage.
What was my mama like?
Really?
Do you miss her?
I think every time I see a climbing tree i'll think of Thomas J.
Mr. Bixler,  I love you.
I love you like my Dad loves Shelly. I wanna live here.
You know Vada, you shouldn't let those girls upset you.
Bye. Well Miss Vada, what d'you say we head back?
Sure.
NO!
Oh great!
Hey look at this!
No, I don't wanna.
Got it!
Well when you get older, you just have to.
You can't marry a teacher, it's against the law.
Yes it is, cause then he'll give you all A's and it won't be fair.
Have you ever kissed anyone?
Uh huh.
Maybe we should, just to see what's the big deal.
What?
He's the salt of the earth.  Kind and loyal and generous.  The one constant thing in my life, is he'll always be there.
Chill.  We don't want your face coming off with it.
I give.
My heart's in my throat, here. Right off, I have to ask this monstrous favor...
... luckiest guy in the Northern Fucking Hemisphere, is all I'm s...
It's not just clubs.  This guy always knows the best everything. The best guitar store, the best beef ribs, the best Horowitz record, was he always like the...
Stop, we're embarrassing h...
Uh, Kimmy...?
Wallace egregious residence, Mandy speaking.
I thought Michael was picking me up.
Please come, please.
The Vespa? Me hanging on behind in the rain all night?
Why don't you start being honest for one fucking sec...
And I was thinking this could be our last time.  Alone.  Together. You know?
I'm up against a deadline.
Michael...
Maybe tomorrow, you'll feel dif...
What's up?
Okay, we'll split up.  You go to every romantic place you guys have, I'll go... someplace brilliant, and the first one who...
I'm sure glad I'm hearing all this now, before it's too late!
Winifred.
Winifred, the kids want you home and so do I.
I said, I've been real tired.
What's wrong with her.
What did you say your name was?
I got trapped and you know it, so let's have some rules.
No, you don't, so don't say you do. Bunch of damn liars. What do you get out or this?
Bastard
He saw us at Tammany Hall.
You want me to wait?
You know anything about the stations here?
All they got is advertisements. Just like L.A.
Listen. Maybe I should go...
I want to get the dog off my bed.
Stay.
I can do benefits
Sorry I'm late.
Where's Bill?
Where are you going?
Got me an audition tonight.
That means his hands are considered a weapon like a gun or a knife. Am I correct on that point?
Looked like an interview to me.
Did you ever see 'Eldorado?'
The episode we did on Mickey and Mallory was one of our most popular ones.
Yes.
Yours.
Yes. Yours got the larger Nielson share.
What I'd like to do---
Manson beat you.
I could go for a Coke.
Just wait one fucking minute.
Through the power of the simple word---
---and a snake-eye glare, Arnold was able to totally psyche out any confidence Ferigno had.
He had the edge. The mind's edge.
Only on a much grander scale.
You can't be serious?
Huh uh. This dozen is for Mickey.
Roger, no.
Roger, do you understand what the word 'no' means? It's important we establish a rapport. Something as simple as a dozen donuts can mean the world to somebody who hasn't had a donut in a year.
Jack, could you stay up here for a while?
But you see, that's okay, Wayne.
They passed the 'edge' along to us.
By taking away our legs. Now we have to fight harder to get ahead than anyone else you'll find in this gym. Probably the whole city. They gave us the fighting spirit. Before this happened I was content. Now I'm pissed off. Now I'm half a man and I've got to work like the devil to get whole again.
Could we go with you and film it?
'You Duff Anderson?
Want to talk to you.
I hear you're tryin' to organize this place!
That's no way to talk, boy. Now we had one of them union men 'round here coupla years ago. Stirred up a lot of trouble. They're always after you colored boys.
You a union man?
Uh-huh. Well, this ain't the railroad. Now what's all this talk about stickin' together?
They say your dad's 'round town.
People seen him 'round.
Thank you, Ma'am. That's fine.
How come you stay 'round here?
That's why you come back, huh?
You got more guts than me, baby. It's a no-good town.
I can see why.
It's okay with me, baby. But how' you goin' to like it?
It sure scares you, a guy like that - settin' out on his porch, doin' nothin'. I seen hundreds of them - all my life.
Don't do that!
Just get her drunk.
What happened?
Jesus, I told you to watch it!
So I been told.
Oh yeah?  Seems to me, Reverend, you' more concerned 'bout your good. Guess it looks kind 'a bad, havin' me for a son-in-law.
Come on, Will.
No. Why?
Let's stay here, Will.
I'm sorry, Danny. Time's up. I'11 do the girl, then me. I don't give a fuck.
You didn't come here to destroy Wintermute. You can to save a man you love. A man who isn't even capable of returning that love. Such a waste...
Easy...
The corporate plundering of Yeshoto Industries... At first these seemed like unrelated incidents, but a pattern is emerging that suggests otherwise.
Our analysis of the London stock crash suggest that it was manipulated from within the international computer matrix. Cyberspace, Mr. Case... A realm I believe you're familiar with.
What's this?
Did you trace it?
You're busy monkeys, Mr. Case. Busy, busy monkeys. Always building models... First stone circles. Then cathedrals... adding machines. I have no idea why I exist, do you know that? You... Your species eventually _had_ to create me. A thousand monkeys sitting at typewriters. One finally wrote "Wintermute".
She's ready to go.
I'm surprised you still are. Should'a told me you had an A.I. running probes at you.
Who got you into this?
Never heard of him.
Fifty-seven minutes twelve seconds.
How much time you got left?
Meet me back here in twenty-five. We'll kick this open if we can. But, Case... you need that access code or you'll just fry inside.
I know who you are.
I gotta know... did it work>
Case... it's four a.m.
Is he going to make it?
What?
Synecdoche uses a part to represent a whole- as in " head of cattle", whereas a hyperbole is simple exaggeration like "I could eat a horse."
Sometimes I wonder what they talk about.
Hi. You're here for the sex talk?
You're Pam?
My own undercover feature - "Written by Josie Geller".
Wow. It's packed.
Josie, you have totally transitioned.
It's my dad. He worries.  Hi, Dad. I miss you too.
Your story was Rigfort's baby. We were scooped! We've got nothing. Zippo. You totally and completely screwed both of us.
Oh.
Are mom and dad here?
Rob--thanks. For everything. This is really happening. I never thought--
Okay This is okay. Smooth.  Can I ask you something? Do you think I tell too many stories in class?
God, I would love to think I'm an interesting teacher. I mean, I had maybe one or two teachers in high school who had any passion at all.
You have to say that. You're my student.
"Surprise!" you were doing a story on me?!
What? Happy? Why? Because it turns out all along that I was allowed to be attracted to you?
Goddamnit, Josie! Drop the act. Do you have any idea what I went through every night because of you?!  I was attracted to a 17 year old! When I wasn't taking cold showers, I was trying to figure out what the hell I was going to do when I couldn't teach anymore! I thought I was the one being unethical.
You set me up. For a story.  You know what's crazy? I was actually considering waiting for you.
Now I don't want to! I bought all of your penguin crap. I thought I found her--the right one! And the problem was she was too young! No - the problem was--she didn't even exist!
The person I cared about wouldn't have done this. Everything out of your mouth has been a complete lie. I don't know you at all. For all I know you could hate Dorothy Parker.
Hey Monty--you think we'll get any business today?
I think maybe people are scared off by the tiki torches.
We followed your instructions.
You're mine, you know.  I made you.
If you went away, what would become of me?
Of course you do, and I want you to... but there's no need to hurry it along, is there?
<i>                      This is a thing called a present. The whole thing starts with a box...</i>
Where are you going?
I told you I want that room unpacked.
Wanna join your little friend?
There is no Jesse.  I'm Jesse now.
Schneider shouldn't have called you out on that double.
Hi!  You didn't have to wait.
Are you sure?
Here.
Will you stop and tell me what's wrong?
you didn't say more than two words to me the whole way here.  You had another nightmare, didn't you?
You want to talk about it?
Hi.
Morning.
Can we talk?  Just for a minute?
What's happening?
Freddy?
This is Phillip.  We call him The Walker.
I think we can stop him this time. Stop him for good.  But we need to know where the bones were hidden.
To who?
Oh Christ.  Simms put Kristen in the Quiet Room for the night.  They sedated her.
What was that?
Elizabeth, I'm prescribing Hypnocyl.  It's a dream suppressant.
Nothing.  They're my patients.  It's my decision.  I want the dreams stopped until we get some answers.
What do you think of the guinea fowl?
No, thanks.  I'll just look around.
Thank you.
I'm sorry -- I arrived outside -- they thrust this thing into my hand -- I didn't know what to do.
I don't think so.  No one has said 'whoopsidaisies,' do they -- I mean unless they're...
These are such horrible pictures. They're so grainy... they make me look like...
It still strikes me as, well, surreal, that I'm allowed to see you naked.
Oh God yes -- I'm sorry.
Well...
More than that actually, when you think about it.  You know, Meatloaf has a very nice pair...
And remember -- Spike owes you an expensive dinner.  Or holiday -- depending if he's got the brains to get the going rate on betrayal.
... with you, I'm in real danger.  It took like a perfect situation, apart from that foul temper of yours -- but my relatively inexperienced heart would, I fear, not recover if I was once again ... cast aside, which I would absolutely expect to be.  There are too many pictures of you everywhere, too many films.  You'd go and I'd be... well, buggered, basically.
I live in Notting Hill.  You live in Beverly Hills.  Everyone in the world knows who you are.  My mother has trouble remembering my name.
He's bringing a girl?
Does the girl have a name?
Good decision.  All actresses are mad as snakes.
By the way -- it's you.
Yes.  What do you think?
If you'd like to come with me we can rush you through the others.
Excuse me -- it's your mother on the phone.
I actually tried that tack -- but she said you said that before and it's been twenty-four hours, and her foot that was purple is now a sort of blackish color...
So -- you've laid the ghost.
Don't give a damn about the famous girl.
Cool, huh?
Bollocks, bollocks, bollocks.  Have you seen my glasses?
Bollocks.  This happens every time I go to the cinema.  Average day, my glasses are everywhere -- everywhere I look, glasses.  But the moment I need them they disappear.  It's one of life's real cruelties.
What's going on?
No.  You can't bin these.  They're classics.  I'm not allowing this.
Yes, Mister Harding?
Easy now, don't smudge 'em, we got lots of games ahead of us...
Well, say, how 'bout easin' it down a bit so a man don't have to shout!
That's it! We made it!
So do I!
You mean to tell me you're gonna count those old birds over there?
Put him in Doctor Spivey's office!
Come on, don't crap out on me now. We got two buddies out there!
Whatsamatter, kid, what's botherin' you...?
Marry who?
Candy? Hell no, Billy, she's just a good friend, that's all...
What for?
There they are!
Neither do I...
Is that your sense of humor or are you tryin' to say somethin'?
Ya deaf! I said pass the ball!
Big king... little deuce... another king... a lovely lady... big ten... and a trey... hey, hey, whadaya say? Ya hit or sit, Martini?
I saw thum! I saw thum!
Well, I was turnin' this dilemma over in my head, when I happened to hit on that old tub room out there, an' I said to myself, McMurphy, I said, that place would make a great second day room. A sort of game room for the young fellas. Whadaya think, Doc?
You think it's funny, huh?
Got a cigarette?
Ah believe ya, brother. Ah believe ya!
Sure, she understands what you mean. She's not dumb. Why do you think Rose came to visit us? Rose is very interested in hospitals and hospital facilities. Aren't you, Rose?
Yes, sir, I sure am gonna enjoy my stay here.
Ya know, I ain't never been in an institution of psychology before.
Oh, there you are, Mister Turkle.
Is everything all right?
The lights were flashing on and off, Mister Turkle.
At this hour?
He is your husband, no?
So, what's the story with your friend?
Don't be afraid.  You can tell me.
We found each other, didn't we?
...has a prior commitment.
A restaurant.  In Piazza Navona.
Congratulations.
So, this is what you do?  I mean when you're not playing other parts?
You're limping.
Are you okay?  You want some help?
The guy at the hotel told me he always wears a gold medallion, and usually has a book or magazine with him.
Hey--
Nice dress.
Yeah.  Well, was the least I could do.
Really?...
Wait.
Aren't you going to tell me who you are?
I don't know, I guess I never really thought about it...  Is Larry here?
"Thrills"?  That's what you're waiting for?  You know how long that lasts?  Besides, how do you know?  Have you ever been out with him?
Why don't you ask him?
It was my New Year's resolution to overcome it.
It's still the new year...
I have vacation time coming to me.
That's where you're wrong.  I got one nine years ago.  I just never had an opportunity to use it.
Would you stop saying that?  I need you to do me a really big favor.
I'll never meet the man of my dreams.
I'm hungry.
What's that supposed to mean?...
Well, how come we're always looking for guys for you?
I never even got to be single.
Not if you don't count the sixth grade.
No.  No, you go ahead.
I'm sure.  And Kate, thank you for coming.  Thank you for being such a good friend.
So...
Giovanni, I want to thank you.
She what?!
And you didn't tell her?
You mean to sit there and tell me that your local takes in sixty-five thousand, five hundred dollars every year and keeps no financial records?
Well, where are they?
Doesn't it seem odd to you that five different waterfront locals were broken into last night and the only articles removed were financial records?
You don't mind working once in a while to justify this lofty position?
We got a little extra detail for you. The local priest and this Doyle girl are getting up a meeting in the church. We'd like a rundown on it. You know, names and numbers of all the players. You're nominated.
Johnny does you favors, kid. You got to do a little one for him once in a while.
Father Barry.
I'm afraid I spoke out of turn last night.
I'd better go in.
Thanks anyway.
What for?
You don't believe in anything, do you?
And if you don't?
Edie!
I don't rate it.
Terry, no, no... .
It started as a favor for my brother you know they'd ask me things and it's hard to say no a favor Who am I kiddin'? They call it a favor but it's do it or else. And this time the favor turned out to be helping them knock off Joey. I just thought they'd lean on him a little but Last night with Edie I wanted to tell her only it stuck in my throat. I guess I was scared of drivin' her away and I love her, Father. She's the first thing I ever loved.
About Edie?
It's like carrying a monkey around on your back.
If I spill, my life won't be worth a nickel.
But it's my own brother they're askin' me to finger and Johnny Friendly. His mother and my mother was first cousins. When I was this high he took me to the ball games... .
Conscience... .  I didn't even know I had one until I met you and Edie... this conscience stuff can drive you nuts.
Waterfront Crime Commission ?  What's that?
Some chance at ten percent a week! And if he don't borrow, he don't work.
I ought to belt you one, J.P.
... .and you'll tell Johnny Friendly.
Is Johnny in?
Count this.
You got some nerve.
Listen Nolan
Easy Shirley, Easy!  Panic won't do us any good!  Let me think. We've got to stall for time.
She is to be <b>mine!</b>  It is so spoken!
No. No! No!
You were <i>both</i> in the trunk?  Together?
Adele?  You in there?
Jesus Christ, what were you doing in there?
Paper says there's ten grand each on you, Chino and Lulu.
Just that she got away.
They know where I live, I guess they know what I drive, so maybe we should pick up another car on the way.
It took you, what, seven hours to buy a pair of shoes?
Come <i>on</i>.
What?
From the looks of those boys, the Ripper too.
You're primary, you're secondary, you're point man.
Yeah, why?
Ironic, isn't it?
Snoopy Miller, famous fight thrower.
Good luck, Richard.
Oh, you mean of Bonnie and Clyde?  Hm. You ever see pictures of him, the way he wore his hat?  You could tell he had that don't-give-a-shit air about him.
Is that right?
You're full of interesting facts, aren't you?
It takes hours to get a drink around here.  There's only one waitress.
Don't leave me.
I wasn't sure you caught that.
He got three years and fined fifty million dollars and wrote 'em a fucking check.  Like that, fifty mil, signed his name.  Whoa-- little help here!
You guys-- come on-- this is too heavy!
Some people are going out of here. What if I told you where and when?
I expect you to look out for me, Pup, let me run off work details.
I hear six.
Looks like tonight.
Gentlemen.  I think we've calmed down now.  Haven't we, Jack?
I got a big score lined up up north. They wouldn't even know about it, it wasn't for me.  I could do it right now myself, except it's so fucking cold up there in January--
Listen, Snoopy, I'm on my way up to Detroit and need a place to crash.
I wanna talk to you about a job.
I can't really go into it right now. I'll just tell you it's someone big.
It's a guy you know.
How's it going?
Was a she, name Tuffy.
I don't know -- the gym, the fights. I <i>know</i> he don't miss the fights.  Having some tomorrow night at the State Theater.  He use to take me.
Remember, pay attention to how she talks about Foley, her tone.  Do it right, she'll tell you things she wouldn't tell Burdon.  Tell her you think he's a nice guy.  No, first tell her about being in the trunk with him, in the dark for half an hour, and see how she takes it.  If she's in on it, what does she get for all the aggravation; cops breathing on her?  I bet nothing.  So she still likes him enough to stick her neck out.  You think that's possible?  What kind of guy is he?
He remind you of that guy, Tillman?
But you know he's dirty and you still wanna see him again.
Maybe.  But you're also curious about the man.  Twice last night you asked your married boyfriend Nicolet about him.  You were concerned, but you didn't want to show it.
You like the wild ones, don't you? Tillman, Nicolet and now Foley.  You know, I've always said there's a thin line between the cowboy cops and the armed robbers, all those guys that love to pack.
In case no one knows what he does. Tell me, Ray, you ever wear one says, "Undercover"?
Midge.
Foley's got it.
We'll ask Evelyn.  Evelyn?  Evelyn!
Ever hear of mai-tai's?  Comes in a big...pot.  Like...like...
Good shooting, Danny!
Land of the free...
She said I was so much like you.  I said, No, I'm not.  I'm like I am because of you, but I'm not you, not as good as you. Everybody else saw me as a loser with a big chip on his shoulder.  But you saw the better part of me, the part of me that could be like you, and changed me. You made me who I am.
Fun today.  Like old times.
What do you mean?  I'm just doing what we've always done.
We've always tried to beat each other.
Sorry.
Hey, have you seen Pearl Harbor at night?
I thought I'd made it clear, I'm not just putting this mission together -- I'm leading it myself.
Danny's not coming?
What?...
It must of been a convincing letter.
I have'na been able ta --
What does Grandma think you do at your meetings?
Welcome to the singles scene.
You just have to remember... men are like houses and trade upwards... I thought you had a pretty good marriage.
All right. What's the scoop?
Don't be silly. It's Saturday. Date night!
How do you feel?
You know. Your love machine... the throbbing thrill hammer... your thing!
I'd forgotten how much music meant to you.
Stop being defensive. I want to help you. I wrote a song for you.
I love you.
We think this party might cheer her up. Just make sure you know what's expected of you.
Show her a good time, but for God's sake restrain yourself.
It was my idea, Grandma. I always wondered what went on at those lodge meetings.
A ray of oneness piercing the solitude. Falling bodies in the ecstasy of flesh. You'll be a chapter in my memoirs of desire.
No, I just made that up. Do you want to hear one?
Thank you.. I accept your apology with the hope that what went on yesterday will never happen again.
You're so young, this is not the time to start acquiring bad habits.
Oh, you're both so naive.
My little baby. Don't try to grow up so fast.
Charlie's downstairs. Why aren't you ready?
Maddy's party.
And the butter.
I have to talk to you. It's very important.
It's not that. Can we meet after school? Please?
You're taking advantage of a minor.
What's the matter?
Not true.  I think I'm making real progress on the microchip.
Thee facial lacerations should heal up pretty quickly. I'll give you som antibiotic cream--
How long ago did this guy retire?
Geoff, dinner's ready!  Geoff?!
What's his name?
Maybe he wasn't dead when we buried him.
How did it go with your father last night?
Why, Beckett?
Don't apologize for me.
I'm ready...
Whatever.
... meanwhile, I'd like to prepare you for a colonoscopy, so we can take a look inside.
Big trouble.
There is no relevant precedent.
Opera?
I better get home. Lisa and I are having some friends over.
You've testified the lesions on your face were visible to the people you worked with, correct?
And it's your contention, that when the partners were made aware of the lesions, they jumped to the conclusion you had AIDS and fired you.
Do you have any lesions on your face at this time?
In what way?
We're going to draw blood.
Joe. I don't care a whit about your private life.
And I hate to rush you out of here, but...
Joe?
Two men making love... ? Now tell me again... <u>why</u> is that disgusting?
You taught him a lesson.
Julius!
Don't wanna miss this.
Bottle-count.
Been a long time since anyone's trusted me. That's somethin' right there.
So where the hell's God now, huh?  I'll tell you where! He's up there PISSING ON ME!
Just a suggestion, but perhaps we should flee.
A very good sign.  That's Riddick's direction. You do <u>not</u> wanna be caught in the dark with this guy.
...I don't play that...I don't play that so just try again. C'mon, Riddick, tell me a better lie....
You said we were going to trust him now. You said there was a deal.
How much you weigh, Johns?
How much?
Why did I fall on you?
I mean, I mean, chrono shows we're 22 weeks out, so gravity wasn't supposed to kick in for another 19. I mean, I mean, I mean, why did I fall <u>at all</u>?
They're afraid of our light. That means we don't have to be so afraid of them.
New Mecca....
A toast to whatever he just said.
Are you fuckin' kidding me?
Look, it's hellified stuff -- but no different than those battlefield doctors when they have to decide who lives and who dies. It's called "triage," okay?
Either way, figure it's something you can grab onto.
<u>Trawl</u> with it. There's a cable on the sled. We can drag the body behind us.
Don't wanna feed these land-sharks -- just keep 'em off our scent.
Take it.
As you wish.
They can't convict us of that. You proved our innocence. Besides...  ... his culture is our culture.
Cornelius has developed a brilliant hypothesis -
-- that the ape evolved from a lower order of primate, possibly man. In his trip to the Forbidden Zone he discovered traces of a culture older than recorded time -
You didn't think so then.
Well, at least they haven't tried to bite us.
Objection! These remarks are profane and irrelevant.
Landon! Send a last signal.
Scarecrows?
They think you're behaving foolishly. I must say I agree. Where will you go?
One is in a museum!
What about me?
No.
Well, Bright Eyes, is our throat feeling better?
And that's your Minister of Science. Honor- bound to expand the frontiers of knowledge.
How sad. Stuffed and mounted, eh? Dead men, like sunken ships, can tell no stories. And his other companion?
Blood trail just keeps going and going but no body.
Youse a pig man. I hope Manny get dat laundry gig for' you do.
Yeah! I got two of them fuckers...
First time?
How the fuck you get over here man, you look like you educated...
You WHAT? Say 'gain.
You volunteered for this shit man?
I know Barnes six months and I'll tell ya something - that man is MEAN, red in his soul like a dick on a dog.
I was home on leave y'know and everybody's just worried 'bout making money, everybody's out for themselves, they don't even want to talk about it man, it's like the fucking Twilight Zone back there - you wouldn't even KNOW there's a war on here. My sister says to me why you have to go there like I started this...
Don't I even get my face slapped?
Okay. You win.
Your liquor laws..
Go ahead...if you want to. It doesn't matter.
He's a fellow with a very hard knee, and he knows how to use it.
He's not a cop. A cop wouldn't have kneed me.
Us?
Why?
Anything I can do about it?
I'd still go through--even if I ended up in jail.
It wasn't the time or place.  Don't worry about the note, baby.  I'm playing for my neck now.
Mine?
Mitchell was dead enough.
Who'd believe it but you?  I took him out to sea and threw him in the water.  Even if they find him, what connects him with me?
You think Magruder wants to hang beside me?
Would I want to?
Good morning, Mr. Killaine. I'm sorry I can't give you the name of my bank--because I have no bank at the moment.  That was a crude trick.
You've got a couple of hours, maybe.
I can't answer that.
That's they're business.  Can I drop you somewhere?
You hurt my feelings. I ought to raise the price to be a thousand.
Bluff. You've waited too long.
I go home and paint the kitchen.
I stick around and wait for the five hundred.
Sorry. Another client paid for that. You can hire me not to use it.
Got it on you?
What?
In case you want to have us followed.
What's the matter, baby. Don't you like me anymore?
I needn't keep you any longer, Mr. Clarendon.
Mr. Brandon couldn't be here.  He might have left something for you. What would it look like?
What do I get for it?
Not too hard, is it?
What about me?
No.
Which forces me to arrest her against my better judgment.
I hoped to get enough to cover them before they cleared. I wasn't lucky.
I have a rough idea.
My first husband worked for the BBC.  I doubt if anyone there remembers him now, just another long dead diligent administrator. He would have been useful in the fight to preserve the BBC's independence during the Suez crisis - one of the few things he was passionate about.  I became involved too.  I started work on a book that would have been published on the tenth anniversary of Suez. Then he died, and I loots the will to write it.  By the time I was over his death, other books had been published, and it wasn't worth going on.
It wasn't much more than a pot boiler.Suez was very important for our generation.  I didn't want it to be forgotten.  And that's why I'd like to be able to help you. But really Mr. Penfield, I looked through my notes before you came, they're all very much out of date, there's been so much published since.  I don't think I'm your man.
I see.  Are you a socialist, Mr. Penfield?
Then I began to listen to what the well-off were saying about the poor now  the war had just ended, and the language was much the same as it had been before the first Reform Act.  A small minority thought that England was really theirs, they had made it, they owned it.  The rest, the wage earners, were foreigners, outsiders intent on wrecking it all.
Did he?  I left school and worked for the Labour Party.  My older brother, George, had just been killed in Greece, and he'd been an active member.  I hero-worshipped him.  He was 25 years old ...  It was an exciting time for us, those first couple of years after the war.  We thought the country was about to become a true democracy.  I can understand why people of your generation want to write about that time.  They feel betrayed.  They want to know what went wrong.
Committed to memory.  Forever.
Can I give you a lift?
Do you think she's invited you up for her sake or for mine?
Bastard.
Six onion bajees!  Great girl.  Did you shake the mother off?
Big mistake, I think.  You might have learned a lot.
I've got to be going.  I've got a meeting tonight.
It was incredible.  He came back, made a pompous little bow and said, 'My dear girl you may film me all afternoon if you wish.' And he's promised not to talk to the Press.
It's true!  I was here last year doing a piece, remember?  I was in the bar with all these Northern trade unionists and their sponsored MPs.  They were all incredibly fat and beery, huge trousers and braces. And so sweet.  They all stood round me like children saying 'You! Working for television?  You're just a young thing.'  They wouldn't let me buy drinks even when I told them the programme was paying. They kept looking at my pass which was pinned here and saying  'Oo, can I?'
Football's a man-made game.  You keep score with numbers.  But in this, there's no field, no rules, no opponent.  Just you and the wave.
I've watched you once or twice.  You surf like it's some kind of street fight.  You jerk along from moment to moment, fighting everything that comes at you.  Always trying to win.
The only way to win out here is to surrender.  You have to feel what the wave is doing, accept its energy, get in sync.  Just feel it all moving in the blackness... you don't need to see.
You're a fucking dead man--
Three seconds... two... one...
Special Agent Utah, this is not some job flippin' burgers at the drive-in. Yes, the surfboard bothers me.  Yes, your approach to this case bothers me.  And yes, you bother me.  You two have produced squat in the last two weeks, during which time the Ex- Presidents have robbed two more banks!!  Do you have anything even remotely interesting to tell me?
Surgical.  Look at them separate the dye packs.  Dick and Ronny know their jobs.
What, you couldn't have just left the thing in your car?
Aw shit.
What do you want?
I mean, what do you want?  What are you doing hanging around here.
Gimme a break.  One shrimp and fries to go!  Anything to drink?
I can see that.  But forget it. Stick to tennis, or whatever you're good at.  Miniature golf.  Here, your number's 37.
Look at you.
Well, usually you have this sort of intense scowl of concentration, like you're doing this for a school project or something... I don't know, like something's driving you.  See, it's gone.  If I didn't know better I'd say you looked almost happy.
Major, looks like there were ten, maybe twelve guerrillas. Looks like they took some prisoners from the chopper.  Then a different set of track, over there.
I knew this man. Green Berets, out of Fort Bragg. What the hell were they doing in here? You got any answers for this, Dillon?
Thanks.
That's over the border, General.
Mr. Harris, we know you've purchased at least twenty percent of our stock.  We also know you plan to file a formal bid for a majority share.
Congratulations, sir.
Hey Sugar, you lookin' for a date?
You looking' for some company?
What?  You gonna tell me you're lost?
Three hundred.
What's your name, lover.
It's a very good year.
So what a ya do with the companies once you buy'm?
You're upset, huh?
You liked the guy, though.
Real genuine guy.
You could freeze ice on his wife's ass.  She anything like your ex?
You don't want to go all the way to San Francisco in a limousine, do you?  I don't.
To meet some friends.  Rudolpho, a poet... Benoit, a landlord... Mimi, a flower maker...
Why do guys always know how to hit a woman?  Right across the cheek, wham, so it feels like your eye is gonna explode.  What do they do, take you all aside in high school and show you how? It pisses me off!
Right.  You're quite the Sir Galahad today, aren't ya'?  I heard what you did with Kross.
Love this car!  Is it new?
Why do you want to know?
We worked for that money.  We were gonna put together enough to get out of that dump we live in, get off this street.
Want a pair of boots?
I got a dress.
I didn't want to get it messed. I got shoes too.  Wanna see?
Would you like to try it on?
If we surrender, and I return with you, will you promise not to hurt this man?
He is a sailor on the pirate ship "Revenge." Promise to return him to his ship.
Catch your breath.
And what is that worth, the promise of a woman? You're very funny, Highness.
I fear I'll never see you again.
But what if something happens to you?
But how can you be sure?
Oh, Westley, will you ever forgive me?
I got married. I didn't want to. It all happened so fast.
What?
I've hired you to help me start a war. That's a prestigious line of work with a long and glorious tradition.
He's with the Prince in the Castle. But the castle gate is guarded by thirty men.
I don't think more than ten.
Don't pester him, he's had a hard day.
What?
Maybe you could come over and read it again to me tomorrow.
Once we're out of sight, take him back to Florin and throw him in the Pit of Despair.
Why? You can't even lift one.
Look, I'm retired. And besides, why would you want someone the King's stinking son fired? I might kill whoever you wanted me to miracle.
I could do that. In fact, I've got some rope up here. But I do not think that you will accept my help, since I am only waiting around to kill you.
Because I know something you don't know.
He didn't fall? Inconceivable!!
What's so funny?
"By the light, by the light,
"Of the silvery mooooon,
"He wants to croon, he wants to croon,
"He's gonna croon love's tune,
"Honeymoon, honeymoon,
Here, don't panic.
They come here.  They all come here. How do they find me?
Okay.  I'm way over here.  Is that better?
Max, I don't want to take any Siegfried Oath.  I don't know what it is, but I don't want to take it. We might end up in the German Army.
What are you doing with those books? Where are you going?
Wait.  No.  How do I know I can trust you?  How do I know you vill present this play in the manner and spirit in vhich it vas conceived?
Not good enough... Vould you be villing to take the Siegfried oath?
Vhy do you always call me kraut? Kraut is cabbage!  Do ve call you hot dogs?  Ve call you Yanks not franks!
Finder's keepers.
No, not at all sir, we're quite serious.  We want to produce your play.  I have the contracts right here.
"Deutchland, Deutchland, uber alles, Uber alles in der velt."
Mr. Liebkind, Mr. Liebkind.
People can hear you.
No. At least I don't recall.
Did you check in Phoenix... hospitals... maybe she had an accident... a hold-up...
Aren't you going to take the pills?  They'll knock that headache out.
Did he say anything about my sister?
Got the number of the motel out on the old highway? Bates, I think. 
I wonder if we'll ever see Mary again.
You can't go up there.
Stuffy in here.  Well... the mattress is soft and there're hangers in the closet and... stationary with "Bates' Motel" printed on it in case you want to make your friends back home envious... and... the... over there.... 
I'll be in the office if you want anything... just tap on the wall.
In the course of my duty, I never "take up" anyone's time, whether it's to give a warning, or a ticket, or help! Believe that, M'am.  Now if you woke up on the wrong side of... the car seat, that's one thing. But when you act as if I've just placed you under arrest...
Norman? Sheriff Chambers.  Been just fine, thanks. Listen, we got some worries here. Did you have a man stop out there tonight...  Well, this one wouldn't be a customer, anyway. A private detective, name of...
I'm not saying you shouldn't be contented here, I'm just doubting that you are. I think if you saw a chance to get out from under... you'd unload this place...
You didn't find anything.
No-
Oh, him. He has a cat of his own. But his assistant--he's the cat-hatenest man I ever saw. Goofy, if ya ast me.]
What are you going to do?
There's no child here, and no dogs either.
Why, certainly, sir. My fiance. Charlotte, may I present Mr. Igor.
What! What are you talking about?
Hello, Express. What's the idea, trying to outsmart the police?
Are you giving me this straight?
Come in, Prussic Acid. What's on your mind?
Make it snappy, Colonel.
Don't give this to anybody else, will you?
Listen, kid. You're in a tough spot, and you can make it a whole lot easier for yourself if you cut out the cry-baby stuff --
That's what I said.
Your dad has stood for plenty. Now let's get down to cases. When did you see the Dale girl last?
Hmmm. Why didn't you tell that to the police?
Uh-huh. Do you remember what she said? What did you talk about?
I see. Was that all she said?
You weren't going with her?
Well, let's get back to the case in hand. They ordered an autopsy and discovered her body had been stolen from the morgue.
Hold on, hold on. I'm trying to help you, if you're on the square, and I think you are.
That happens to be the truth.
A fire! Is this your idea of humor, my friend?
I'd know him anywhere.
Could you?
A place you've never been.
I've been dreaming about this.
Hmmm, it's soft. It's awful soft.
Well, I thought they were more like a cantaloupe.
There's some kind of gristle in it, though.
Actually, I am, though.
Can I put my hand inside your nightgown, Rose?
Rose, can't I see what the nipple on it is like?
Here comes Daddy.
Neither do I.
See, son? The paint is flaked off here, freshly. Look at it, Brother, there is no question about it. Some person or persons unknown have very recently tampered with this ladder.
Rose is almost as sentimental as Mother. If there's one thing I can't stand it's sentimentality. In Chattanooga this man committed an almost perfect murder. He killed his wife with a black widow spider.
She's putting the titty back.
Well, you rascal, where'd you come from?
About as good as can be expected with one foot in the grave. Good to see you, son.  Did you bring any of that Yankee whisky with you?
I am ahead of you.
Please do.
Of course.
I wish you wouldn't pick on Rose and tease her like that. Of course her clothes are silly, but she's ignorant, naive, she doesn't know any better.
Well, I admit that outfit isn't very modest. But she doesn't mean any harm, she just wants to attract, attention.
I don't think you understand her. It isn't sex she wants, it's love she wants and this is the only way she knows how to get it.
He and his wife both said she had a fine moral character and was wonderful with children.
But that's a wonderful quality, not a bad quality.  Have a little patience with her. She's such a good-hearted little thing and tries so hard.
Be kind to her. She loves you so much.  In a perfectly proper way, of course.
Excuse me, sir, are you calling my wife a liar?
This is a total catastrastroke. As of this moment I am stumped, I admit, I am stumped and treed both, the hound dogs have me surrounded.
Why, that looks like Dave Wilkie,
You're so sweet.
Why, sure, always got time to get you a half-a-cup, and one of these days I'm gonna get you a whole cup and see what happens.
Good morning, Rose. And how do you feel today?
Well, I know it, I just got the bill for it.
Umm. Well. Yes. But no more strange voices in the night, Rose.
I'm not cryin' because of me, I'm cryin' because of somebody else.
Um-m, well...
Well, no, I didn't actually.
Yes, thank you, Doctor.
Mother... is Rose going to die?
Poor thing. Does the ice help, Rose?
Don't worry, honey, you'll find something.
Have I ever steered you wrong?
Oh, you fuckers!  You fucking fuckers!  What?  What do you want?
I... I can't find my seatbelt.
"A.D."
Who's been giving you history lessons?  Your bartender?
What about him?
Hey...
You live like a pig.
Hey now, look!  Let's all get on the same page here.  This shipment is do or die for Zimmermann's syndicate; all or nothing.  If we stop the drugs, we don't even have to catch him red-handed.  He's ruined cause his pushers go broke with nothing to sell.  On the other hand, if we fuck this up, it means more zombies crawling the gutters than ever and a morgue that doesn't have a single empty drawer.  More old ladies getting mugged and molested by junk-hungry needle-freaks, and all the while Zimmermann's sitting back and laughing his head off.
Your poison's not gonna make it into the veins of any kids this time.
Hold your horses, sweetpea.  We need Butch Cassidy alive, remember?
Any preferences?
You're... you're not doing what I think you're doing... ?
You see that?
You told me Vader betrayed and murdered my father.
Oh, no, my young Jedi. You will find that it is you who are mistaken...about a great many things.
I thought she was with you.
What's going on?
Chewie! Chewie, give me the gun. Don't move, Lando.
It's all right. Trust me. Don't move.
What did he say?
Now lock onto the strongest power source. It should be the power generator.
Luke, don't talk that way. You have a power I--I don't understand and could never have.
Yoda, I must know.
I see.  So this wasn't simply a chance meeting.  You came here with a purpose.
Gosh.  That's the third motorcyclist that's passed us.  They certainly take their lives in their hands.  What with the weather and all.
Right!
Good God.
On the day I went away.
Was all I had to say
Want to come again and stay
I thought you liked them.  They liked you.
Y'know how I got started in the fight racket?
Y'know how I said that stuff on television didn't bother me?
I been watchin' the movies -- studyin' -- He ain't weak nowhere.
...I dunno.
It ain't so bad, 'cause I was a nothin' before --
I do -- Maybe what this fight needs is something new -- a novelty.
Shape, nothin' -- They're afraid. They know everybody in the world's gonna see this fight an' none of them gotta prayer of beating me so they're makin' excuses so they don't have to be the chump that's gonna be whipped in front of the whole civilized world!!
I don't like ya face.
Kiss my ass.
...How 'bout for the Cokes?
Don't hit the face! Not the face!!
Honest to God I'm broke -- Gimme a break.
Y'know I won't be able to work for ya no more.
I feel bad about walkin'.
Nobody likes garbage -- Anyway, this girl with the dirty mouth wasn't bad lookin', but the guys wouldn't take her out for any serious datin'.
'Cause that's the way guys are -- They laugh when ya talk dirty. They think ya cute for a while, but then ya getta reputation an' watch out. Nobody's ever gonna take ya serious. Ya get no respect... I gotta use a bad word -- Whore. You'll end up maybe becomin' a whore.
That doesn't matter -- You don't really have to be a whore, just act like one an' that's it.
Best seat in the house -- Hey, Mick, this is too much.
Don't you care what the people will say?
Whatta you get outta this?
You were ready to bite that guy's face.
I usta be deadly at half-ball.
What kinda business?
Ya really like her?
What's the attraction? I don't see it?
What gaps?
You ballin' her?
Oh, a ladies man, huh?
This is fifty bucks.  I need seventy-five before they check the books tomorrow.
Is this paper even good?
Can you get him out of it, Eddie?
Marvin Acme had no will.  I should know, the probate is in my court.
Right here where we're standing, will be the cornerstone of my idea... the cloverleaf -- an elegant cement structure that intertwines freeways.
A freeway, Mr. Valiant, is eight lanes of asphalt running uninterrupted from L.A. to Pasadena.  Pasadena to Hollywood.  Hollywood to Santa Monica. Someday everyone will be in cars driving happily, non-stop from one end of the L.A. Basin to another.
You shot Roger.
Where'd this gargoyle come from anyway?
Son-of-a-bitch...  Mr. Maroon, I think I'll be goin' now, so about the rest of my fee...
Look, pal, if you're still here when I finish this drink, I'm callin' the police.
If you're so innocent, why'd you run?
Hey, doesn't the rabbit even get a last request?
You know, Eddie, I'm not as much of a chump, and a patsy, a yokel as you think.
Two bits.
Boo! Ah, ha ha. Ooh. Boo! Ha ha ha.
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
Do you bite your thumb at us? Sir.
Every man betake him to his legs.
How well my comfort is revived by this.
Juliet!
[Within] Juliet!
[Within] Juliet!
Nurse, give leave awhile, We must talk in secret. Nurse, come back again; I have remember'd me, thou's hear our counsel. Nurse, Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age.
By my count, I was your mother much upon these years, You are now a maid. Thus then in brief: The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.
Verona's summer hath not such a flower.
This night you shall behold him at our feast; Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face, And find delight writ there with beauty's pen; This precious book of love, this unbound lover, To beautify him, only lacks a cover: So shall you share all that he doth possess, By having him, making yourself no less.
Madam, your mother craves a word with you. Come lets away.
And then Sam, you and I clean up whatever's left to be cleaned.
I never did trust that blonde fuck...
Sam.  I'm a weapons guy.
Are you alright?
Yes, Gregor, they sent me.
That was a mistake, trying to kill you. Mikhi did it without consulting me, I'd have never allowed it.
We'll double your price.
Do you have the material?
Perhaps we could both go at the same time...
What am I doing here?  Why, I'm here to see my partners, Gregor, the boys in the Russian Mafia.  See, your bosses had hoped to screw me by hiring you to pull your thieving double cross.  But they only just found out that what's in the briefcase is completely useless without me.  I can't fight them, and they can't kill me -- that means we're gonna have to do business together.
Hello, Jean-Pierre.
The point remains: we could be working for different people.  There's a chance for one of us...  Maybe more than one of us -- has been paid to cross the others.  I don't know about you guys, but I like to know who I'm working for.  It can help prevent a great deal of...  ...unpleasantness.
I don't particularly like killing, tubby, but I want you to know that this one I'm going to enjoy.
That was a nice move you did on our young friend.  Judo?
Same thing, isn't it?
What's the difference?
What's going on?
The Irish representative?
Do we need anything else?
Why's that?
It's the Irish tape we want.
Seamus Reilly, boy's a serious Irish Auteur -- a real firebrand.  Thinks his more moderate filmmaking brethren have turned to making movies for peace-loving pussies, if you see what I'm saying.
How old is Otis anyhow, thirty?
It's no accident we stumbled on this money.  It's an answer to a prayer!  Every night and every day I've prayed that God would just -- help me out a little, give me a little push.  Tonight my prayer came true.
That's right!
I'm not letting some gangbanger send me to jail.  We can't risk it.
You're thinking about killing him. I can't do that.  No way.  I've never killed a man.  Never even shot at one.
I can't do that.
You're crazy.
Not bad enough to kill him.
We got to get out of here.  Do you understand?  We got to get out of here right now!
Well, I don't know...
Could it have been in the Mercedes?
Yeah.
So do I.
Test the product?
I guess we can get started.
OK...this is good.  Our first solid lead.
Well...I should have done a little homework, getting all the sizes, and what not.
I'm just not very good...with all of this stuff.
A lot of men come in here?
Something wrong, Jesse?
You walked in here looking like you just ate a shit sandwich.
You shut your mouth you son of a bitch!
What the hell are you doing, you crazy some bitches --
This whole place?
What the hell is that?
Did you give me five-hundred dollar chips because I'm black?
You assumed a brother coming in here can only afford five-hundred dollars a roll, is that right?  Are you a racist?
You see, no bomb.  Now stay away before I throw you both in jail for obstruction.
I'm an undercover agent for the United States Secret Service.
Oh, you American?
You bring American money?
I'll meet you at the bar in ten minutes. They don't like tourists in here, so try to blend in.
What are you doing?
Well, hurry up.
So are you getting on the plane or not?!
Come on, we still got time to order the Kosher meal.  Always get the kosher meal, they bring it first.
What's she doing?
I don't want to hear this.
Snoopy?  I love Snoopy.
I'm not used to having a partner.
Well we're not friends.
Fine with me.
See you in the next world.
Fine.
Yes.  We have heaven.
What's a Chinese heaven?
I think we should stop talking.
You thinking about that girl that dumped you?
If she was the right girl, you'd be thinking about her.
How was the sex?
You're kidding.  No sex?  Nothing?  No mu-shu?
What about a little king pao chicken?
Steamed dumplings?
That's rough, man.  If I don't get steamed dumplings once a week, I go crazy.
Are you serious?
Carter...here comes the rich white man.
I saw that.  She kissed you, didn't she? You played it cool, though.  Walking away, never looking back.
It wasn't hard to spot the fakes until this past year.  Then Tan got hold of one of a kind Swiss made hundred dollar plates -- and started making superbills.
What are you doing hanging out with Baby Duck?
You're just like your father, Lee.  All these years hiding behind his badge.  I wanted to help him, to share with him, but he was too afraid of change.  When you think about it, I didn't really kill him.  I just put him out of his misery.
Lee!  It's him!
Fifty million!  Are we talkin' United States dollars?
Beach Boy.
You make the plate?
The license!  You get it?!
What the hell kinda cop are you?!
It was my ass that almost got trashed!
Yeah, sure, you got lots a enemies in L.A. after what?  Six hours?
You want more?
Like that.
Yeah...beautiful. What would you call that paper there? Kind of a...Robin egg blue color?
Jesus...what do you want?
This is my city. I'm a cop. I'll find em.
What do you mean you lost him?! How could you lose him?!
Okay, look, we're gonna make a trade. You cross the street, leave her on the sidewalk.  I will leave him on this side.  Then we trade places.  You get him, I get her.  Get the picture, Lois?
I would like one of my people to help.
He is very good.
Yes.
He wanted to know how you used to like your eggs.
Fully.  I like her.  She has wit.
Look, he's running after her.
No... They're interesting guys.  Each one of these guys has something going for him.  I mean, one's been up Everest. Another's become a priest.  One's a pretty good guitar player.  And this guy today tried to end world hunger, if you can believe that...
It's okay.  There's no microphone. You're no fun.
You should thank Lou and I for the wedding car -- a '63 Buick.
Did something happen to make you care about reality?
You're going to be very disappointed.
You're welcome.  Your notes made interesting bedtime reading -- if you like trashy fiction.  Your observations are distorted, ungrounded an incomplete. You must be very proud.
I don't know.
No.
Kind of isolated.
I love you.  I love you.
So -- Mag -- you've seen this, huh?
You're right.  It's not funny now. Maybe we both grew up.
I'm really rooting for this one.
Don't touch them.  I feel terrible sneezing at a time like this.  This is a big moment for me --
Becky heard this woman on the radio complaining about this guy she was sure was Rick, which meant he was cheating on her.  She was completely hysterical.  Then it turned out the woman lived in Duluth.
You should write something about this.
I thought I would look into doing a story about those radio shows.
I need to know about him because... he's involved with my sister...
She has a pattern of getting involved with losers... Once she almost ran away with a human cannonball from the circus.
No, I know that part --
No, no, no, it's more like, who is he, does he have a sense of humor, is he nice -- no forget nice, I've got nice --
I'll tell you the truth, I heard this guy on a call-in radio show and I might not marry the person I should marry because I've become obsessed with him.
No.  Not remotely.  I just want to find out about him.
Everybody! Annie has an announcement --
It's you.
Do you think there's somebody out there you could love as much as your wife? Maybe even more?
Just because someone's looking for a nice guy doesn't make them desperate.
No.
It is not --
I can hear you walking around sometimes.  At first I thought it was a robber.  Go ahead, tell her, Dad.
How did they get our phone number?
Listen to this --
Just this one part, okay?  "I have been an excellent third-baseman for as long as I or anyone else can remember, and I guarantee you will not get one past me"
God, she's beautiful.
Maybe we'll get a dog when we get back.
What do you mean, okay? Wouldn't you like a dog?
How's Jonah taking it?
You're kidding --
Want to go up to your office, Mr. Alexander?
You're welcome to one.
The men would like to know who this gentleman is.
How goes it?
To the mine?
We did. It got lost in the shuffle.
We can't get everything at once. Right now we've got more important demands.
Not just Juanito. You'll have it good too, Esperanza. We're going to win this strike.
We've got to have a talk, you and me.
A meeting?
Hear those deputies slugged 'Cente.
And another thing. Your attitude toward Anglos. If you're gonna be a leader ...
You lump them all together -- Anglo workers and Anglo bosses.
Sure. But you want the truth? You're even suspicious of him.
Yeah, but he was in silhouette.
They were wearing ski masks. I told you all of this.
What about the guy on the very bottom?
: What are you up to?
What do you want from me, Colette?
It gets me through the day.
No. I want to know what the hell is going on.
Who is it?
That's a good one.
You know, Jimmy, you might as well put a sign on the back of this thing asking the cops to pull you over.
Yeah, that's what I mean.  Where the hell does this guy live anyway?
Why do they call him Pooh-Bear?
You're going to have to explain that one.
What?
You don't understand.
Come on, guys ...
Cool it. We got business.
If he finds out it's me, I'm a dead man.
That's because he doesn't have one.
Guy scores dope and dollar from ripping off other drug dealers.  As least that's what the word is.
Then why didn't you help the kid when you were there?
Excuse me?
Why doesn't Palmdale P.D. just raid the guy?
Why didn't you just ask for directions back there?
You mean like the Donner Party?
Tom, quit fucking around.
Where's Bubba?
I'm Jackson.  I'm from West Fork, Tennessee.  My pappy's a preacher. Him and his two brothers got a ministry, The Blessed Church of the Wandering Gospel.
In the back of a nineteen and thirty- one stretch Hudson with a big ole' trailer.
I don't make jokes about things of, or related to, the preaching of the Holy Gospel, including the ministerial calling of my family.
We got us a tent, forty-two feet across, eighteen feet at center, hundred-and-ten foldin' chairs. Circuit's eleven towns, covers all 'a Hasset County and most 'a Weller County.  I expect that upon completion of my military service I will be joinin' said ministry.
You know what the best possible thing that could happen is?
Me?  I'm walking with my hound, Lucy, it's about an hour 'fore sunrise and we're out huntin' coon.  I got me a flask of pure Kentucky mash whiskey...
I'm in my backyard, lying in my hammock, with my arm around my wife, listening for the sound of breaking glass.
You see, I've got the best house in all of Addley.  It's not the biggest house, but it's got the best location, right next to the junior high baseball field.  The garage windows face left field.  The guy who owned the house before me had these heavy screen S put over them.  The first thing I did when I bought the place was take off those screens.  Two-hundred-twenty- two yards from home plate to my garage windows.  It takes a hell of a junior high kid to hit a ball that far.  I look at my garage windows as a Motivator and a way to scout the kids coming up, the ones who are going to give us a shot at the state championship.  I lay there in my hammock and every time I hear the sound of breaking glass, I know we're one step closer to winning it all.
It's worth it.
It looks like a Renoir.
I've been humming it.
It seemed appropriate.
Some.
Upham, you've got to learn the difference between whining and griping.  You can't just rely on natural ability, you've got to study and practice.
There you go again, that's whining, that's not okay.
Uh, Captain...
How about...?
What do you think?
What are we going to do?
Captain, I gotta tell you, the irony of this mission is fucking killing me.
I should be on my way to Caen, sir. It's like Beethoven, the guy's one of the greatest composers ever lived and he goes deaf.  Go figure, I mean, who'd he piss off?  And here I am, the Beethoven of ladies foundation garments, one step away from Caen, the center of the known lingerie universe and instead, I'm going to Ramelle to save some fucking private who's probably already dead.
Sir, you know what Ramelle is famous for?  Cheese.  The rest of the company is going to Caen and we're going to the goddamned cheese capital of France.  There is no bright side.
I'm listening, sir.
Up.  We're moving out.
What deal?
Don't do that again.
Wade's right, it's some kind of scientific, magnetic thing, I can't explain it, but I've seen it.
On guard, glancing back.  Pissed off.
Thanks, I like yours too.
Hello Constance.  It's me, Lloyd... nothing, I'm just driving around... she broke up with me... what do I do?  Can't she come back?  How can I get her back?... I can't think, talk to me... I fucked up... I feel like crying... she gave me a pen.  I gave her my heart and she gave me a pen.
What does it say?
"Dear Diane, I'll always be there for you, all the love in my heart, Lloyd."  I've never gotten a letter like this, have you?
Ha!
She's not the world's greatest flyer, let me tell you.  When she was eight years old, she...
Dad, in a million years, I would never give him a pen.  What's wrong with having some fun?  I like him.
Alright.  This is really great.  Alright, we're going out. It's a date.  It's a scam.  Whatever, whatever, alright, I'll pick you up at what, eight O' clock?
Eight. Eight O' clock.
Thanks.  But either way it still feels...
You know what?
You're a great date.  I've never really gone out with someone as basic as you.
So what's your job this summer?
No, I'm serious.
I only have something like sixteen weeks.
Then call me tomorrow.
It's okay, everybody does that.
No.
Don't worry about it.  We're just having coffee.  We'll be anti- social.
Yeah.  With potential.
I'm fine.
Why don't I just get your phone number, that's usually how it works.
Diane Court.
We finally graduated, big dude guy!
It's not a charade, all this?
I go to work the other day, there's nobody there.  Nobody tells me about this, I have to find out, I have to go in, everybody's gone -
If you admit to making three, then it's four, actually.  But how?
You have any idea what a shirt like this costs?
That'd be fine.
I could try to read this or I could eat my lunch while it's till hot.  We're doing well?
Better this month than last?
Any reason to think next month will be worse?
Eight hundred, give or take.
It's got nothing to do with reality, Oskar, I know it and you know it, it's a matter of national priority to these guys.  It's got a ritual significance to them, Jews shoveling snow.
File a grievance with the Economic Office, it's your right.
We don't know if it's random. We haven't been able to connect the victims.
Don't do that. Hang up...call...
Hang up...call...
...campus security...send someone...check out...place...
I get my revenge and make some fast cash.
How do you put up with this Greek shit?
This is exactly what I don't want.
He seemed harmless.
Yes, Miss Weathers, your name is embedded clearly between my ears.
Yes, I do retain reading skills. Shock.
Page 32. "Deputy Dewey filled the room with his dim-witted Barney Fifish presence." I think you've explained yourself.
This is all too familiar.
Who is this?
Someones trying to kill me. I need the police.
Yes, goddammit!
I dont know.
Okay, you're sure about skipping Calculas?
What about rehearsal?
The Ghost advances on the young girl, grabbing her, pulling her to him, raising high a long, hunting knife. The young girl is helpless...
..this week's TKE kegger...
Come on, baby. Lighten up a little, will ya?
No, Jennifer Love Hewitt. Of course it's me, silly. And I feel like an ass standing in this theater lobby all by myself. Where are you babe, the movie starts in twenty minutes.
All I'm saying is I'm gonna be royally p.o.'d if you don't catch my acting debut.
I did. Hon, although I got a total of six minutes screen time, they're the best six minutes of the movie.
Can I help you?
Who?
But you won't. You're a good man detective. We think alike. I know you need my help. And I know you know I need your help.
Please, call me Gale.
That's fine Mr. Rielly, but if anyone else should die, I'm going to have to get a warrant.
I was afraid they were bait, something to, ya know,  trick you out of hiding.
Dewey, personal lives and pasts aside, this is about Sidney. We need to know where she is.
Paternity test results. Christ Dewey, you're never going to believe who Milton's kid is.
Shit! Where the hell are Tom and Angelina?
Excuse me Detective, I think we have some business to attend to.
Gale he's got Dewey!
I know!
If you lay a hand on him I'll fucking kill you!
What? She asked.
Think about it. On the off chance I get caught -- a motive like that could divide a jury for years, don't you think?. You took my mother, so I took yours. Big sympathy factor. Maternal abandonment causes serious deviant behavior. It certainly fucked you up. It made you have sex with a psychopath.
Thank you, Hank. We're on it. What were you doing out at Sidney's tonight?
You rode your bike out there?
No... I don't... it's just... Oh God, Billy, someone was there, someone tried to kill me.
I know. He called again last night at Tatum's house.
I'm so sorry... please understand.
You know that's not true.
No...
No, it's me, Billy. I need time. I'm still adjusting to my mom.
Tomorrow. One year tomorrow.
Your parents split up. It's not the same thing. Your mom left town, she's not in a coffin somewhere.
It's called GUESS HOW I'M GOING TO DIE!
Hello.
Who is this?
I don't think so.
I'm two seconds from calling the police.
Please don't do this...
No... please.
...please...
Don't do this. I can't...
No...
Don't make me... I can't... I won't.
People treat me like the Antichrist of television journalism.
You gonna be able to come down to the station and talk to us a bit?
I was first to respond.
Drive by patrol.
She's tough.
Casey! Casey!
Off the record. No cameras.
I have no idea.
Aha, Randy, you gave yourself away. Are you calling from work? Tatum's on her way over.
I like that thing you're doing with your voice, Randy. It's sexy.
Don't start. You know I don't watch that shit.
Stu was with me last night.
Fuck you, nut case. Where were you last night?
I thought Blockbuster fired you.
Why would he want to kill his own girlfriend?
So what's his reason?
She's saving herself for you.
I think her father did it. How come they can't find his ass?
Which is you...
Why are they doing this?
You sure I can stay over? My dad won't be back til Sunday.
Tell your mom I said thanks.
Uh-huh, it's just... you know, the police and reporters... it brings it all back.
Thanks, Tatum.
It was just some sick fuck having a laugh.
There's that sense of humor. I knew it still existed. Ohh, Sid, let's have some fun tonight.
That's not necessary.  You're in.
Already.
And... and... and he said... he asked me if I was married.  And, I could see he had a gun in his hand.
What?  What?
You didn't know.
Here he comes.
You think it was poison?
It's a package deal.  You get the phone with the office.
Gould's wife.  She was away on business. If this means she saw anything, I don't know what.  We've questioned her at least five times.
Oh, yeah, sure.  You got to be kidding?!
The way this has gone till now, I wouldn't have thought it was possible, but we may have underestimated this guy.
Listen to me.  He's all about playing games.
We have to divorce ourselves from emotions here.  No matter how hard it is, we have to stay focused on the details.
This is a waste of time.
I know, I know... focusing on one little thing.
What are you talking about?
You knew I'd say yes.
Tell me it's not true.
You have a strange way about you... I mean interesting.  I'm sorry.  It's really none of my business.  It's just nice to meet a man who talks like that.  If David saw that paper, he'd say you're a fag.  That's how he is.
Neighbors heard them screaming at each other for like two hours.  It was nothing new.  But, then they heard the gun go off. Both barrels.
It's all right, ma...I been watchin'... Only I wish...
Is this in the line of duty, sergeant?
They're camped by the river -- 'bout twenty miles from here. Soon's it gets dark we'll circle out so's to jump 'em before day- break.
Now son, it's a bitter thing to say, but there's more than your sister at stake here.
Martin! Ride me as far as the well!
How'd you come by this?
That's what I said.
Nothing for you to see.
Jorgensen's been runnin' his cattle with my own...
<U>YOU</U> don't understand, ya chunkhead! <U>You</U> didn't buy any blanket! Ya bought <U>her</U>!
You got yourself a <U>wife</U>, sonny!
Lemme alone...
I know you are...Only it ain't goin' to be that way...she's alive...
Every young man should at least once...Go on, Laurie! Read!
She'd be about thirteen now...
Where?
But couldn't you...?
Hey... the fuse.
Who was that?
"Events commonly interpreted as haunting apparitions often result from psychic disharmonies or undigested traumatic ordeals..."
Of course you'll give me the blame again.  Like back then.  Just a tiny cut and he could still be alive today - isn't that right, Ellen?
I really hate to bother him, but...
And that is?
Look at this.  The lock is totally demolished.
I know your face. Are you an actor?
Yes, I've seen you in something. That one about a king.
I swear it. He wants Romeo for Ned and the Admiral's Men.
I have not said all. By malign fate, the message goes astray which would tell Romeo of the Friar's plan. He hears only that Juliet is dead. And thus he goes to the Apothecary.
Mr. Shakespeare has given me the part of the Apothecary!
Now where? Will?
We are lost.
How will it?
Be good to her, my lord!
Your Majesty
"Thus from my lips, by thine, my sin is purg'd."
Wait, you'll see the cat bites his head off.
Oh, do not go
Will you read it for me?
I meanYour Majesty, they do not, they have not, but I believe there is one who can
"Poet?"
I don't want to devalue your victory, but I just want you to know: I wasn't trying to win.
You learn that in your psychotherapy group?
Family? Family? Friends? Drugged-up wandering suicidal search of the self fuck-ups don't have families, David.
What is this?
From what? Jehovah's Witnesses?
No, can't think of anything else that matters.
It's very kind of you to offer, but --
What?
So we'll meet him, then?
Who's going to do it?
I don't thinkI can.
I don't want to. It's different.
Is this the same stuff you made last week?
I hope it tastes better than the other stuff.
You'll wait in the hall?
And if it sounds like I'm being killed, you'll phone the police, you'll tell them everything?
Everything. Except maybe that it was his idea and not mine in the first place. OK? That's important to me. I need to die misunderstood.
What?
Can you afford this place?
It's just that you strike me as a man trapped in a crisis of emotional direction, afflicted by a realization that the partner of your dreams is, quite simply, just that.
I'm sorry.
It's nice.
Offering it for debate.
-- yes, Senator -- just a minute, dear --
She's got a...
Yeah, I think so.
I don't know.
I know.
She did?
Wow.
-- Anyway.
She's fine. You really think I'd be a good investment?
No, I know.
I know.
Well, is she your girlfriend?
Are you in love with her?
Are you?
Then it's not your problem.
No. You know too many sick ladies.
How do you expect to get anything done if you allow yourself to get sidetracked? Particularly in your business... you deal with women every day...
Don't worry, honey, I'll protect you.
Right now?
-- Listen, I'm supposed to take Jill to El Cholo tonight. She's really going to be pissed if I don't.
I don't know. Probably not.
Bernstein... seemed to think I hated men.
No! Don't! Please!
-- don't you want to --
What's wrong?
Do you know what that Lillian Bercovici just did?
-- Right after I sprayed her?
Nothing, my sister's back from Vegas.
I have to see you.
Honey?
When?
When is that?
When is that, George?
But I never know when you're working and when you're not working!
What?
Didn't you, baby?
I wish you'd go now.
-- yes.
George...
Please!... that's not like you.
George, now cut this out.
Stop it.
Yes, yes, I did.
George, if you keep this up I'm going to scream.
George...
Well, George, you may not think ten or fifteen grand means much to me, but I invest for myself and a lot of particular people.
Well anyway...
Hell of a way to treat a business partner, that's all I can say.
Me!
I called to tell you I was sending one over but the line was busy, you're always on the phone.
Who were you talking to?
My secretary saw you with that boy.
They get hair all over the place.
I am? I mean why?
I'm not. Maybe I am.
I'm terribly sorry.
What does he do? Is he an actor?
Good for you.
Now I didn't mean that, you rat.
You're going?
Look, is there somewhere else you'd rather go? Maybe we can change our location.
Do you have children?
Are you married?
Do you have something against traveling?
There were a party of settlers in the covered wagon times.  They got snowbound one winter in the mountains.  They had to resort to cannabilism in order to stay alive.
You don't?  Well what's your favorite food then?
No I ain't.
Oh what a Maze.  Isn't it beautiful.
Mommy!
Have you been in Boulder long, Mrs. Torrance?
Ah ha, it's coming off now, sir.
I'd be glad to do that, sir.  Oh why don't you call me back in about eh twenty minutes?
No, we don't mind.
No charge?
Any ideas yet?
You went into the room Danny said - to 237?
And you didn't see anything at all?
Of course I am.
I'll bring back a doctor.
I'm gonna go now.
I don't believe they did.
even before anybody knew what a jet set was.  We've had four presidents who stayed here, lots of movie stars.
Jack is going to take care of the Overlook for this winter.  I would like you to take him around the place as soon as we are through.
Did he really get his head cut off, Dad? That's what Brady said.
Not bad, huh? My Uncle Al took off the regular muffler and put on a Cherry Bomb.
Glasspack. He said he'd come over sometime this summer and we'd soup up the engine... but now I dunno. He's getting a divorce and he's in the doghouse with my mother.
Yeah, okay, the fireworks. Jane thinks that's all I'm mad about, but it's not. Them doing that is just a... a...
Well... I like it that you always know how to say things, Uncle Al.
Don't call me dear boy.
Do you really think that a man who took a rocket in the eye three nights ago could be out mowing his lawn? He'd either be in the hospital... or dead.
I come here because Marty needs a friend.
LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED
How are you doing.
Babe, it's not me!  I love you!  It's God!
The minute I saw you. I said to myself, she's a weaver.  Have you ever used a loom?
Well, it all comes back, in just a jiffy.  I'm working on a wall-hanging, of the convent.
To sell, of course.  I hate to say it, but we're in terrible trouble here at St. Katherine's.  We need a new roof, the furnace is going, and there's no money.
SPRING IS HERE THE SUN WILL SHINE I'LL BE HIS AND HE'LL BE MINE WE'LL LOVE UNTIL THE END OF TIME AND WE'LL NEVER BE LONELY ANYMORE
Mary Clarence, are you with us?
We could cut a demo.  Look for a label.
Well, then there's only one thing to do.
Mary Clarence!
The Council of Cardinals!  I'm so nervous!  What if I forget the words?
Fine.  Got it.  Look, the way I see it, I'm stuck here, right?  I mean, I'm here or I'm target practice.  So here's the deal -- I don't bug you, you don't bug me.  I'll catch up on some sleep, watch some tube, lay back and lay low.  So just get me a key and show me to my room, and do not disturb.  Capisce?
This shall be your cell, Mary Clarence.
Mary Clarence, perhaps you are correct.
You may stay.  But I shall restrict your activities to but a single task.
Reverend Mother -- Thank-you.
You saved my life.
Jesus, what do you think this is -- Wheel of Fortune?  Let me spell it out for you.  You have to hide like you don't even exist.  You have to get so far hidden away that you never see sunlight.
No nothing.
Well..  thanks.  I've been thinking about you.. - sometimes.  I mean, there aren't a lot of guys around here.  I mean, sometimes I feel like... a nun.
You're not... seeing anybody?
I have?
We could put you into our witness protection program.
It's done?
But, boss -- she's still, you know, a nun.
We sound terrible   We need Mary Clarence.
Is this like your old convent?
You mean -- they kidnapped her?
Las Vegas -- she's here somewhere.
We both missed.
What the hell are you doing?
It has been a terrible jolt to her nerves.
Taken.  Taken by the Headless Horseman.  Taken back to hell.
Very few, if any.
For one who calls himself a Federalist, your mouth reeks of Republican liberalism.
We are farmers here, not lawyers or bankers, or even constables.  Every penny we earn comes from what we send down the Hudson.
Thank you.
Someone left last night.  Looked like they headed to the square, but I lost them in the forest.
All I saw was their lantern.
She's the one who controlled the Horseman, isn't she, sir?  Sir? 
Is it me, or are you this nervous around all women?
My suitor?
He has proposed to me twice.
Why would you do such a thing?
I have misjudged you I think.  I did not imagine you were so cruel.
What are you on about?
Must I hear this?
And this gives worth to butchery?
What is it then?  Scientific method? How can any of this matter in the slightest?
Take a lesson from Young Masbath's desires, Ichabod Crane.  He follows with you to avenge his father's death. That I understand.  But, what do you want?
What... what are you doing... ?
You said yourself.  What mere man could have downed the Belltower?
Van Ripper... do you have a gun?
Go home.
You do not want to be here.  Go home to your father.
She is guilty.
She has confessed.
Thank ye.
My name is Frank Wheatley. What's your name?
He don't want to Doyle. Don't go Vaughan if you don't want to. You'll wreck Doyle, you're drunk.
I want to watch T.V.
You like that Vaughan?
I ain't never used no hatchet that I remember.
Hey there. I thought I heard somebody on the porch. Wasn't your name Karl?
Yeah. What you doin' by here?
Did you want to play ball with us?
Well, anyhow, I was just fixin' to go see my mama down at Ben's Dollar Store. She's workin' two till eight.
Way to go, Karl. We got a touchdown. That was a good lateral, man. That was just like the Wishbone.
How come Karl won't eat here with us?
A blister shore can hurt.
Flowers is pretty. I've always thought that.
You scared me.
Want to sit down? Did you need somethin'?
Yes sir.
That boy wants me to.
Naw, I ain't.
Quite a spell, I reckon.
I done et just a little bit ago.
I reckon I can stand to eat a little somethin' or 'nother at noontime tomorrow. Bill Cox generally gets me a box of french fried potaters. But I reckon he can lay off doin' it tomorrow.
Karl, maybe you and Melinda might want to take a walk or something after dinner. It's a nice night.
Also, Melinda, please don't tell anybody at the store that Albert was here tonight, okay.
Well, a lot of people in town talk and spread cruel rumors. Unfortunately, I have to keep certain parts of my life private.
Yes.
What'll it be, Auggie?
Hey, Auggie, I've just been thinking. You wouldn't need some help around the store, would you? Some summer help while Vinnie's gone?
I'm thinking about the kid. I'm sure he'd do a good job for you.
Fine.  Or it was until a couple of days ago. A guy from The New York Times called and asked me to write a Christmas story. They want to publish it on Christmas Day.
Yeah, great. The problem is, I have four days to come up with something, and I don't have a single idea.  You know anything about Christmas stories?
Anything good?
It doesn't have to be true. It just has to be good.
So you're just going to give up and go home?
Still, you can't just write her off.
She's just a kid. There's time for more babies later. After she grows up.
Not if you got her into one of those rehab programs.
No you're not.
Remember that business venture I was telling you about? Well, my tugboat came in. I'm flush.
Come on, come on, you yellow belly. The whole thing. First name and last name.
I don't mean to be nosy, but I was wondering what happened to your arm.
And have you mended them?
You named the kid after yourself, huh?
I'll tell you why they're not going anywhere.
That's it. Just the two rooms.
I used to have one, but it broke a couple of years ago and I never got around to replacing it.  I'd just as soon not have one anyway. I hate those damn things.
I listen on the radio. I can see the games just fine that way.  The world is in your head, remember?
My father did. Believe it or not, that little baby is me.
It's strange, though, isn't it? Looking at yourself before you knew who you were.
No, he was a schoolteacher. But he liked to dabble.
Twelve, thirteen years ago.  Actually, he died with his sketch pad open on his lap. Up in the Berkshires one weekend, drawing a picture of Mount Greylock.
Is that what you do? Draw pictures?
Yes, an invitation. I apologize for springing it on you at the last minute, but Mr. Benjamin and I are attending a celebration tonight, and we would be most pleased if you chose to accompany us.  Isn't that right, Mr. Benjamin?
If it doesn't make any difference, why not just say it?
So the blood on the gaff was not fish blood at all.  It was <u>human</u>, yes?  Type B positive.
Just three questions.  The Miyamoto family bought your seven acres for $4500?
Second question.  What did Ole Jurgensen pay you per acre?
So that makes what would have been $4500 into $7000, doesn't it?  If you sent the equity back, you had a profit of $2500.
It is.
You thought the deceased might... break his promise?
My mom.  Would be the problem.
You don't believe in God anymore.
...comes off third cleat from the stern, port side.  And it's brand new.  Unlike the rest.
From Carl Heine's boat.  All his were like this one, three-strand manila, new condition, braided in loops.  Not bowlined like Miyamoto's.
<u>Everything</u> had to happen <u>just</u> right.  For your little story to fly.  I mean, a blond hair could be on that gunnel for a <u>lot</u> of reasons.
But Carl was a fisherman.  And successful at it.
How long you have this detail?
This tastes horrible, hmmn?
Cigarette?
You must think I like losing.
I think you testified <u>all</u> the lights were on.  Cabin, mast, net lights, picking lights...
And yet you started the engine right up.  With all those lights drawing all night, the batteries had that much charge.  Did that strike you odd?
Does it now?
In your motorcycle example.  Those injuries are produced by the head being propelled <u>against</u> an object. Rather than the reverse, yes?
Can you tell whether an object moved against the head, or the other way around?  Or would both look the same.
So if his head struck something narrow and flat, the gunnel of a boat, a net roller, a fairlead, could that have...
Is it possible?
Is it fair to say that you do not know for <u>certain</u> which it was.
...He used to say, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it."
Well, the soldiers we've got now, they've been through all kinds of heavy shit...and they've always got the job done.  Now these new ones, these "hot shots" of yours...what kind of action have they seen?  They <u>are</u> battle-tested, aren't they?
The sweep is just routine, not even police action.  I'd like to see some sort of...meaningful evidence...
You're in Berths 7 and 7A.
You're welcome.
Same faces - same instruments -  - and here's your Valentine's card.
No.  And he ain't been eating so good, either. He's got an empty stomach and it's gone to his head.
You've flipped your wig!
It's no use.  We'll never get away with it, Joe.
Forget it.  One false move, and they'll toss us off the train - there'll be the police, and the papers, and the mob in Chicago...
Look - no butter, no pastry, and no Sugar!
I heard a very sad story about a girl who went to Bryn Mawr.  She squealed on her roommate, and they found her strangled with her own brassiere.
That's some nerve!
You crazy or something?  The place is crawling with mobsters - gangrene is setting in - and you're making like Diamond Jim Brady!  How are we going to get out of here?  How are we going to eat?
Good night, Sugar.
I'll carry the instruments.
Well, I'll be - !   How about that guy?
Sugar, dear - let me give you some advice. If I were a girl - and I am - I'd watch my step.
Yeah - Josephine.
Where did you girls play before?
If there is one thing I admire, it's a girl with a shapely ankle.
Let me carry one of the instruments.
I called Mama - she was so happy she cried - she wants you to have her wedding gown - it's white lace.
We can have it altered.
Why not?
It doesn't matter.
I don't care.
I forgive you.
We'll adopt some.
Please, Jerry - that's no way to talk.  Nellie baby - what are you doing tonight?
Because I got some plans -
And you'll be in all evening?
Good!  Then you won't be needing your car.
Tell what?
Thanks, honey.
Well, I guess I'd better go -
And you will come to hear us tonight?
I seem to be out of gas.
Maybe if you saw a good doctor...
Don't talk like that.  I'm sure there must be some girl some place that could -
Gee, I wish I'd been there.
Good evening, sir.
I don't believe I've seen you at any of our services before.
PLEASE!
Hello, Charlie.  Long time no see.
Just dropped in to pay my respects.
God, Kat! Please. Dont be nice to me. I can take anything right now but you being nice to me.
Youd better get going. My parents will be round to cart you off to the country.
Whats going on with you two?
Theres a reason I always tell that Tony Pee-Pants story, you know.
Before Tony, you and your sister were best friends. I couldnt split you up. If your sister ate the spinach, you ate the spinach. If you threw up--.
Anyway, when that boy came over, it was the first time you ever did anything without her.  And Amy wasnt just jealous...she was sad and lonely. She missed you.
I didnt deserve her back then.
Whoa, Jeffrey. Slow down. You and me, were the past. Im not sure if you noticed, but Im here with someone else.
Its called character. God, youre predictable.
You think we look like were trying too hard.
No, count it, anyway.
Would you grab my shampoo?
Subtle?
You have had girlfriends?
Hi.
You want I nut him in the boat?
You want me to let him in?
Im guessing MacCallum, 18 years.  Neat, with a water-back.
And you say all them people is dead now?
What are you looking at, out there? There's nothing to see.
If anybody's to blame, it's me -- I oughta nailed him when I took that shot.
Can you say what camp they gon' send you to, Daddy?
Why, Daddy; you won't be here?
I'm real proud of how you helped your mama to keep this place goin', David Lee.
David, you never cease to amaze me at how good you are in taking care of my garden.
You got two shirts on?
Mama! Mama! Miss Boatwright, say she gon' help me find where Daddy is!
Be good and be smart, little boy.
You know, one time by mistake I went into a white church down in Row County and to this day I don't know how'n the devil I got outta that church alive.
I guess so -- but I went home and did me some praying to the Lord. I said, Lord, I went into this white church down in Row and all I want you to tell me is how I ever got outta there in one piece.
I bet you could use a hot cup of coffee, Nathan Lee.
There, you see?
I just got out here!
Well, anyway... Today children, our friend Mr. Hat is going to tell us all about the environment.
<b>And my mom has become so bu-sy that she's raising heck and ignoring me I agree that there is now a battle to be won! Something must be done!</b>
How come Terrance and Phillip are so weird looking?
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?!
Mph rmpmh rm.
Ugh... You guys, seriously... I'm having Cheesy Poof withdrawal...
We can't, we're on a hunger strike.
May I?
Mph rmph rm!
No... The General is right.
Be careful, dude.
Dude, anybody who doesn't think Terrance and Phillip is funny can fuck off anyways.
This is sweet!!
Stan!
Shiteater-
Article 42!  You don't mean-?!
But I-
HA HA HA! You burned yourself to death by lighting the fart! HA HA HA!!
Did you hear that, Terrance? I farted!
Yeah!  YEAH!!!  Man I'm getting so HOT!!!
Listen buttercup, let's make love and forget about the whole thing.
Ow, you're hurting me!
Stan! Stan are you okay?!
I never though I'd be stuck in a wine closet with Warren Wayne.
And what are they doing now, Mac?
It's telling me fail mode confirmed.  Did you see this?
Yes I'm sure I hit the right commands.
Barnes, can you hear me, are you all right?
Barnes?
Break it down to me, what's going on?
Well don't drag your ass.  There won't be much of a window for us to link up.  We'll be in your orbit trajectory in less than two hours.
Will do.  What about the distress signal?
Well, more power to you.  Me, I start to bug out after too much time out here.
I don't think you know what you're talking about.  Besides, what could we use for tools?  A steak knife?  A corkscrew?
I can't let you do that.
Dawn!  Dawn!
I'm in the bridge.
What is it?!
It's getting too cold in here.  I can't stand this anymore!
Now Mac, can you tell me the status of this deck?
You a mini-golfer?
Paradise, huh? Might be one of the new putt-putts off route 99. Theo turns to leave.
You have orange whips?
Ah, come on, lemme see your ball.
Bowling police, step back, give him room.
Buzz Fazeli.
I know your face, you're an up-and-comer. You bowl on the tour.
Need some advice, huh.
Watch out for that one. She's got a great average, but she's looking for a prince. And, believe me, she's 
So, eh, you never saw me. Right?
Thanks, kid.  Where are you goin' now?
Listen, if straight doesn't work out, you come work for me.  Just make sure nobody's following you. Buzz's face is eerily lit by the glow of the sunset, his halo bouncing in the breeze.
You give Ed Klein of the American Bowling Congress a call.  Tell him your Maynard's boy. He's expecting you, and he owes me. He'll getcha back in like Flynn.  Don't say I never gave you nothing.
JUNIOR!  You're supposed to say JUNIOR WHO! I'm going to have to hurt you. Theo and Junior circle one another.
No, Junior, you shouldn't touch her.
What did your dad tell you to do to Buzz? Theo scrambles up the lane on hands and knees. Junior catches him, grabbing his ankles.
What did you do to Buzz?
So you're Buzz's boy. I've been expecting you. You hurt my feelings when you didn't come and see me sooner.
Nobody sticks a finger into a bowling ball in this town without Miles Kastle knowing about it. You don't mind if I have a word with Theo, do you bunny? Kastle takes Theo by the elbow and pulls him away.
You might say I'm at the top of their shit list.
What's with the bad air between you two, Mr. Kastle?
Fantastic! What talent.
What's your specialty?
Then I'll have the number four with one of your finest whips.
Uh...over easy.
I don't think your new outfit suits you, Theo.
Where are you going?
Can I come with you?
Very good, busyboy.
In basic English, what does all this mean?
Nobody move.
Don't do it!
What is it?  A military spacecraft? Like a shuttle or satellite?
Not really, no.  Something of the military crashes in the ocean -- it explains why there was nothing on the news, why you've kept everything a secret...  When did it crash?
Harry's missing.
He's missing.  He's gone.  He left.
What the hell?  It shut us down.
Nothing, sir.
Man is man, all he knows is man, and all he can think of is what he knows.  The anthropomorphic problem. Good, Norman.
With an "o".  Harold with an "o".
We had considered it.
It's not talking, it's mimicking.
Norman!
You said something to him, didn't you?
... what do you mean?  I'm in the ship.
Getting food.  We were out of food. what's wrong?  You sound mad.
Deserts you?  Harry said he'd take over for me.
Diphenyl parlene.
What's wrong, Norman?
Where is it coming from, Beth?
I don't get it.
Jerry.  Right.  I said Jerry, didn't I?
I'm sorry.  Slip of the tongue.
Nice work, Norman.
What is that?  That noise?
What is it?
Three fifty-six, three fifty-five, three --
It's just like swimming, Norman... You know how to swim, don't you?
Hey, go easy on the salt, will ya? We're not a bunch of icy streets here.
Any other bags, Dr. Johnson?
It's not some fucking substitution code, it's a direct visual representation.
Take a look.  I rearranged the numbers.  Put 'em up to the light.  Go ahead.  Squint at it.
Squint harder.
Try this one.
Don't you see it?  It's a picture of the creature.
I'm Han Solo, Captain of this vessel.  Who's in charge then?
I'll get the information.
I know who you are.  Stand up so that we can talk properly.  You're embarrassing me.  I'm not that important.
Are you all right?
I'll tell you, Luke, and this is between you and me.  The star force isn't all it's cracked up to be. Frankly, it's a bore, and it's going to stay that way as long as this system is neutral...
The academy is fantastic... Of course, they won't teach you anything about flying you don't already know.  Most of the instructors are very conservative pilots.  You can fly circles around them... but there is a lot on the scientific side that is down-right amazing, and you get a lot of discipline... but after you graduate, don't join the star force -- go free-lance.  It's the only way to get into the action... I can't wait until my hitch is up.
There are only three or four left.
You can't!  We've come this far.  We must find them...
It's only light that doesn't affect it.  Solid things, like rocks, can hurt it!  Fire above him!
I am Luke Starkiller at your service.
Let him have it.  You're winning anyway.  It doesn't make any difference.
Funny how they always want to be your friends after they kick your guts out.
Whad'ya talkin  about ?
Mr. Barcalow, save power, don't waste it on workers... Ace, tell Aardvark we're on our way...
How do you make him do that ?
I'm all ears.
I want to be part of the best flight team in the Fleet...
Where are you going ?
That girl who died on the way up ...his girl ?
How do you feel about him now ?
Isn't it great to be in love ?
He was in the group with me. I guess he didn't...
Shhhh...!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAA !
Report.
Cover me.
Johnny, people get hurt... people get killed in the Federal Service. If something happened to you I don't know what I would do...
Wait a minute ! Carl is doing his Federal and he isn't inferior. He's the smartest kid at school !
I always wanted to go to Zegema Beach.
Well, yeah, sure...
We're outa here. Lieutenant, get your men into the skimmers. This real estate's about to go buggy.
Where'd you learn to do that, soldier ?
Rico, tell'em to glass this goddam planet. I've never seen so many bugs upstairs at the same time...
Kirk-unit, <U>why</U> do you not disclose information?
They have repressed the Creator.
As I stated, V'ger calls to the Creator.
'To learn all that is learnable.'
That's why you're staying aboard. I'm sorry, Will.
I advise caution, Captain; we can't withstand another attack.
They may have attacked only as a warning to us, Captain. To keep away.
I now the Captain meant no person- al insult.
Transmit, Mr. Spock! Now!
Maneuvering thrusters, Mr. Sulu; ahead one third.  Full sensor scan, Mr. Spock; they can't expect us <U>not</U> to look them over now!
Also -- there was nothing in your report about <U>why</U> you're here.
No vessel could generate a powerfield of this magnitude...
If this is their ship's data banks, where is the crew? Or is their entire ship automated?
There's no way to know. V'ger expected it to be a machine -- some single entity.  All of us here may be reduced into patterns...
The third one is moving off too -- a fourth one is forming...
So young, so unlined, so full of promise.  So innocent.
The, the, the, the <u>sanctity</u> of everyday things...
For example, he's just come back from a <u>fire</u> and he...um...  That's a fine house.  You look at that, and you know, there's nice people that live there.
Really.  With the porch swing and everything...
Hello.
Don't look good for "Trial of the Heart."
Don't you think you should put them in water?
Going home, yeah.  I told them what you said...
Lookit that, up already.
And I might have something important to tell you...
What courthouse?
Town ain't got no courthouse.
<u>This</u> is your movie, this is small town America.
...upset and impressionable...  Get me the Mayor...
...overcome by the events around her, the presence of a high-powered...
Are you all right...?
You do...?
No.
Hi.  I hope I'm not disturbing...

Wally...

Uh.  Bob Barrenger, fella, <u>Cameraman</u>...

<u>Siddown</u>!
Marty...
Do something.
...the damn thing...
I hate wax lips and red ants and pretzels without salt...
Like who?
Because it's quiet.  And he wants to talk.  Alise -- Once he saws you in half, it's bedtime...
Probably you -- your brother -- school -- The solar system...The usual...
I'm a little tired and it's just a pick-me-up.
Well Daddy and I are just friends now, and that's no reason not to wear mascara...
We make mistakes.  And we forgive each other.  Because we love each other, very m...
How many devilled eggs can you eat?
You swore.  You owe me a quarter.  Did you remember my egg carton?  I told you I needed my egg carton for seed planting today.
She still packing for her trip?
The guy <u>I</u> see is in the eighth grade at <u>Prep</u> School, and he laughs his <u>ass</u> off every time we talk about you.
You touched it.
No.
'In the still...still of the ni-ight...I held you... held you so ti-ight'...take it, man...
Not a lot, sweetie.  It's a country. Like Canada.  Only smaller.
In the still...still of the ni-ight...I held you...held you so ti-ight...
It's not good enough.
I've got it.  It's in the can, Cooper can wrap th...
Just outside the big top, we're almo...
At the Big Apple Circus, it's the only big top I know.  I <u>said</u> I'd get 'em back tonight...
You're still going to have to be dealing with me -- with us.  We should tell them together.
She's been talking about this little editing machine, it's only...
She already hates me.  You've seen to that.
I need practice.
...make some trips into the city. Sometimes, overnight.
You bet you are.
I don't, but...
And you said...?
Hon, maybe your mom would like t...
Now we're going to have a fight, you and I.
And I'm going to win.
Thanks for coming out.
Now Edna says you short-changed your last meds.  You can do presents and be comfortable at the same time, y'know.
Oh my God.  Are you serious?
Why in the world would she t...
I needed some time away.
I don't know what's wrong with that kid.
Don't ever say that.
Consuelo?
Do you have any brothers or sisters?
Really? How many?
Wow.  Why did your parents have so many children? I mean, if they were poor, wouldn't it be better to have just one or two?
But do you really believe in God? And heaven, hell and angels and all kind of stuff?
Mom?
I was looking through Scooby's SATs practice books this afternoon and I took one of the practice tests. Guess what score I got?
Well...yes. If it hadn't been for Hitler, he wouldn't have had to leave Europe. We would have been...European.
Oh, I know, I know that. Well, sharing your story, your ups and downs, and so forth, can I hope, be an illuminating experience.
OK.
You're not.
That's good.
Uh, well, anyway, so I'm looking for subjects for this documentary on teenage life in suburbia. Kind of an exploration of the mental psyche of its mythology. I wrote to Derrida to see if he'd like to do the narration. But everything's still kind of in development at this point.
Hey, um, Toby? I was wonderingIs the documentary almost finished?
Can I see what you have so far?
Just get me a coke and don't argue with me, OK?
I drew my gun, ran in the direction of the cries...violating the first rule of service...I let the Ambass- ador out of my sight.
Enjoying the tour so far?
Why the hell didn't you tell us this was at stake!
How goes the roll call?
Just what the hell is he talking about?
But, finally, one factor tipped the scales. We received information from a very re- liable source that your country was going to build one.
The source was...shall we say, completely reliable.
Please, Mister President, I am extremely shy and do not wish to endure this sort of personal humiliation.  Here is the only other camera I have left. 
Yes!
Yes, sir.  One thing, Mister President.
Under a condition red alert, the base will probably be sealed off and defended by the base security troops.
Well, sir, they may not allow the Special Service troops to enter the base.
But then, sir, why have you issued the order: Wing attack, Plan-R?
I still ask, why do they want disarmament?
No, Major, I don't.  They have no regard for human life.  They wouldn't care if they lost their whole country as long as they won.
Major, you're talking like one of them!
Don't be offended, Major.  Our President holds the same views.
I'll tell you what I do think.  If they say they're for disarmament, I say anyone who says they're for disarmament is either a traitor or a damned fool.
But if they suddenly opened up and gave us the inspection we want, we'd agree, wouldn't we?
And you'd like to see that?
Do you think we'd cheat?
Do you think they would cheat?
Have you received acknowledgements from every plane?
How long will it take to receive them all?
Roger, maintain.
Missiles!  Sixty miles off, heading in fast.  Steady track, they look like beam riders.
Hey, King.  Somebody at Burpelson has a very perverted sense of humor.
Gee, we hate to leave you like this, Major Kong.  But there isn't anything we can really accomplish by sticking around.
Let's have a rundown on the damage, Lothar?
There are plenty of traitors and spies running around loose.
Nobody's loyalty is beyond question.  Besides, how do we know one of his staff didn't see it?
In a matter of weeks, sufficient improvements for a dwelling space could be provided.
That was really great.
Yeah!
Slides go with it.
Oh yeah? Oh, how'd you ship it over there, man? Federal Express? Hm? By the time it got there it'd be way cold and coagulated. Total waste. Cheese be stuck to the cardboard.
Yo, your gettin' me all upset here.
Go!
Yeah.
Yeah, he's told me. Burnfield. We all hear about Burnfield.
Oh, you were in the band?
Hey, we're just having a conversation.
Yeah, we're all above that.
Thanks, man!
It's okay. This kind of thing happens. It's just never happened to me. I'm sorry. It's true though. Mm. So, um, what's your TCB tattoo stand for? What's that about?
Erica, you coming?
No, that's not what I'm saying. I'm saying I don't need a limousine to know who I am, alright?
I mean, you know, at least I admit that I don't know. I know that things are fucked up beyond belief and I know that I have nothing original to say about any of it, alright? I don't have an answer. I don't have a fucking message.
Hey, w-why don't you see if he's hiring, you know? Get an application?
Oh! Trim it!
Sorry. Let's go back to the van right now.
It was a racial incident.
It got that close.
Oh, yeah?
Okay, what would you have done.
How?
Jeff. Jeff.
Jeff. You know, I was talking to Mister Brooks yesterday. He has this friend in New York who wants to sublet his apartment for six-fifty a month. I could swing that. Six-fifty.
I've run out of words.
I don't know. And I don't care that I don't know.
What about us? I'm moving away your staying here.
Maybe not? You think that I'm with somebody else and now it's maybe not?
You're unbelievable.
You did, huh? Good for you.
So, um, Pony, where are you staying? Are you staying at your mother's house?
What about this, huh? Go ahead, big man.
You know, why do you call me names? You know, I never hurt you. I'm only working here.
Okay, now, you guys all take care, okay? Oh, man, I feel so good. I feel good 'cause I'm hanging out with you guys, man. You know? I mean, I forgot what it was like to just hang out.
I hate it here. It's so ugly, it's like being dead. You got out of here, you know? I'm ready to go.
Yeah.
Me?
Yeah, you know, when you called I thought, there's a name from the past.
Yeah, I know what you're saying.
Well, I called Erica's beeper. There's just no answer.
Well, I mean, she always answers her beeper.
Yeah? Well, what'd she say?
About where she went. I mean, what bar?
The bar at the hotel? She told you that? What did she say exactly?
Make a move. Greasecake. Towel-head.
Fucking drunk, huh?
What?!
Di, are you okay?  We can skip the girl party this week.
C'mon, Luce, people do it in the movies all the time.
Jack, I think I should get a job.
I know, but that was before.
Hat-trick?
It was Lucy!  Lucy went to the cops!
She's been the weak tit on this mama cat since the beginning.
Yeah, hold on.
Don't use big bills!
Look, maybe I can watch a PG movie... I'll just say I'm counting dirty words for Sunday School.
Yeah.  This summer at church camp?  I'm pretty sure I had, y'know, an orgasm.
Kansas, I want you to meet someone special.
What?!  Hush up, you mouthy little shit!
Say, you're not really smuggling opium these days,  are you?
If I could be of any help...
O.K.  Where's the cash?
I was afraid of that.
Look at this street.  All card- board, all hollow, all phoney. All done with mirrors.  I like it better than any street in the world.  Maybe because I used to play here when I was a kid.
I was born just two blocks from this studio.  Right on Lemon Grove Avenue.  Father was head elec- trician here till he died.  Mother still works in Wardrobe.
Third.  Grandma did stunt work for Pearl White.  I come from a picture family.  Naturally they took it for granted I was to become a great star.  So I had ten years of dramatic lessons, diction, dancing. Then the studio made a test.  Well, they didn't like my nose -- it slanted this way a little.  I went to a doctor and had it fixed.  They made more tests, and they were crazy about my nose -- only they didn't like my acting.
Should be.  It cost three hundred dollars.
Not at all.  It taught me a little sense.  I got me a job in the mail room, worked up to the Stenographic. Now I'm a reader...
Not once.  What's wrong with being on the other side of the cameras? It's really more fun.
Last time I saw you was someplace very gay.  I remember waving to you. I was dancing on a table.
Just a minute, you!
You're a writer, you said.
Now what is it?  Where's the fire?
Oh...and I thought it was a matter of life and death.
Hold me tighter.
You think this is all very funny.
Is it funny that I'm in love with you?
I can still see myself in the line: Bebe Daniels, Marie Prevost, Mabel Normand ... Mabel was always stepping on my feet ...What's the matter with you, darling?  Why are you so glum?
That's a lie!  They still want me!
What about the studio? What about De Mille?
Wanted what?
That's a lie!  They want me, they want me!  I get letters every day!
Some men are here.  They asked for you.
That's what I told them.
We've come for the car.
Well, it's one way to get her down stairs.
But the Power Source, Zaltar.
But what will happen?
Why did she have to show up now?
That's easy for you to say, Bianca.
Is this Nigel's doing?
Maybe it was just an accident.
Of Course I don't hate you. I  don't hate anyone.
You think so?
But what if---it wasn't real?
She's right. They'll string her up.
Nurse! Nurse!
Nurse!
Selena, I've been thinking. It's time I settled down---and I don't know a nicer lady to settle down with than you.
Marry me, Selena. The hardware store doesn't bring in much now, but...
Jimmy, would you please put those poor flowers in water before they die?
You see, a tree is a living thing.
Linda babes! There's this all-night party at Eddie's... his folks are away...
Go back, sign in, and climb out the bathroom window. McCloskey's always zonked out: she'll never hear you.
Thank you both so much. It was a lovely lunch, Mrs. Danvers. I had a wonderful time. And you're a terrific chess player MR. Danvers.
You better have a pretty good explanation for this, Selena.
Where is inner space?
There's no way out of the Zone. No one's ever escaped. That's why they send the criminals here.
Yeah? What do you want?
I just think Ricky would rather not get a bowling lesson in front of the other kids.
I just can't stand this.
It isn't only that he's small for his age. how would you like to be the only kid in town without a father?  Look at him, he's stewed to the gills in the middle of the afternoon.
Gee, I always loved porch swings.
Do you really know Superman?
Name?
I believe they're laundered and sent to some charitable institution. I don't know what the heck they do with 'em. Maybe they use them for dust rags, or pen wipers...
Yes! That never occurred to me.  Her ya go, buddy, single-malt.  Gus, my friend, you're a genius. Okay, a naughty genius, but hell, nobody's perfect.
Always making yourself beautiful for me, aren't you?  So, Gus, can you make Vulcan do what I want it to? You didn't answer me, pal.  Did you hear about that prison riot last week? It seems they were complaining about rats in the cells...
When?
What?
Is this blackmail?
Is this whitemail?
Hey listen, I didn't know your mama was comin' by...
Oh. I'm Lana Lang. This is Ricky.
And this is...  ...Clark.  My friend is around here somewhere, I'll just look for...
Well, don't let me keep you from anything.
Come on, will you?  We've got to get ready before he gets here.
85,000 dollars.
You mean...you mean...Vera! Vera! The magnitude of this!!!
He's coming! He's going to hurt me!
Clark, everything I was saying -- can't you see I only say it because I really care?
Who ????
Clark . . . it doesn't matter . . . we can move . . .
. . . Superman?. . . . .
Well done, Miss Teschmacher.
-- as the keeper of the archives of Krypton, it falls to me to tell you of the darkest episode in our planets history.
For many eons the peoples of our world have lived together in harmony. Then there appeared among us three anti-social elements - what on Earth are classified as "criminals."
The three proved - after exhaustive efforts - incapable of rehabilitation. Now as you know, we had no death penalty -
And so our scientists constructed, from an irreversible mathematical equation, the Phantom Zone. In it we imprisoned these three arch-villains for all eternity.
The Elders have, of course, thought long and hard about that question.
The one danger we have considered is that the Phantom Zone might - we cannot predict - just might be cracked by a nuclear explosion in space. I cannot say I am glad you asked me that -
So --  I hope you like it.
No drinks . No movie. This is the last time I take a charter flight.
So this is the planet Houston . . .
I've never been in a place like this before.
Hello, Lacy. Can anybody break a twenty? The cabbie didn't have any change.
The President is about to speak. I don't think it's going to be good news.
Lex, we all appreciate how you've supported us lately and . . . uh . . . in recognition of your hard work we've decided to increase your commission to 12 percent.
Tone down our headlines? Lacy, that's all the common man reads!
What's that?
Hey! He looks . . . normal.
I hadn't counted on this but . . .  . . . of course - the power of the sun has given him internally generated heat. I am a ...
What? A genius? . . . an inspiration?
I'm not going anywhere.
Which explains why you sent his organic matter to the sun.
You'd risk worldwide nuclear war for your own personal financial gains.
Ah! The guest of honor at last! And about time, too!
Mother...
Stop him, Clark!
You! The girl from the volcano!  Kryptonite...
What are you doing here?
Besides that.
The bald man! The one who tried to kill me?
Damn!  This will get him.
The door jam, Miss Teschmacher. This Ethiopian shmendrick here, in his simple, unconscious way, needed something to wedge the door open, the better to inhale the flies that form such an  important part of his diet. So he grabs something from the table...
What do you suggest, my dear?
Oh. Why? does he live up here?
Need I ask who's favored to collect at the end of this week.
Here's the story on that East 19th Street murder spree. Page one with a banner headline seems about right to me.
What color underwear am I wearing?
But, to someone from the planet Krypton, this substance would be lethal because of its high level of radioactivity. Kryptonite! Ah, Kryptonite! That's the stuff!
Nice! Most of California would have been destroyed. Millions of people would've been killed! The West Coast as we know it would have  --
I'm glad to hear that Zoe's okay.
Not really.  The last time I saw her was at that clinic.  That was a long time ago.
Which one?
I don't remember the name.  It was near a beach.
That's my daughter.  Or it may be the police to tell me that they've found her dead.  She's a drug addict.
So what brings you out tonight?
What are you thinking?
Billy loved to see his kids in the bus.  They always sat in the back, so they could wave to each other. It comforted him.
From what?
No, nothing like that.  Billy's wife, Lydia, died of cancer a few years ago.  He took over raising the children by himself.  It was obvious how much he missed Lydia.
He never took his eyes off his mother, even as he moved to sit beside Nicole.  He looked frightened.
Is this mine?
From you?
I don't like thinking about the accident.  I don't even remember it happening.  Besides, it just makes people feel sorry for me, and...
I have no questions.
You always think you're prepared for these things.
How old is she?
Is this it?
Here we go.
Some more wine?
I'm sorry about that, Mr. Stephens. Would you like to try the fish?
Been drinking since high school. Fucked himself up.  Used to be smart enough.
Probably half a dozen traffic convictions.  Drunk driving.  Lost his licence.  That's why he don't work no more.
How does the family survive?
You believe that the bus driven by Mrs. Driscoll was going at seventy- two miles an hour at this time?
That's too high.  I'll never reach it.
Well, there's the Hamiltons.  Joe and Shelly Hamilton.
He's somewhere...
Went over to Philly yesterday an' seen the folks...it's nice you send them the fifty a month...
Blessings on thee, the both...well... Gotta run now.  See you two kids later!
Susie, you're very much in my thoughts today.
What a question, dear, with that newspaper in your hand...
Susie, did you know about this accusation...?
Say hello to Sidney Falco.  Tickle him - he's been a bad boy tonight. He called you my fat friend.
Frankly, J.J., I don't think you got the cards to blitz me.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think so...
Well he's got her in a tizzy, I'll tell you that!
And who's feet is she on now?
What's this boy got that Susie likes?
What does that mean - integrity?
Listen with care - this will cost me everything, so you know I'm telling you the truth!
What's your favorite ribbon to go around your favorite chocolates?
What do you want all of a sudden - Lady Godiva...?  Where's my other shoe?
You ought to be used to me by now.
You're talking very fast.
Do you think J.J. likes Steve...?
I tried to reach you twice -
Jimmy, I'm on my way inside right now to talk to Hunsecker.  I can promise you -
Steve...what you tried to do today...you tried to take me up on a high mountain...I couldn't go all the way...I failed you...  Will you forgive me?  Have I lost you, Steve?  Have I...?
No one's ever stood up to my brother the way you did.
I just didn't think that I could antagonize him, Steve -- for OUR sake, I mean.
Do you know about the chip?
Where we going?
Can I stop by my house?
You sure?
Listen to me, very carefully, okay?  You're not a terminator any more.  Alright?  You got that? You can't just go around killing people!
Whattaya mean, why?  'Cause you can't!
Excellent.
Is it dead?
Mom?  You okay?
It has helped me a lot to have a goal, something to look forward to.
My CPU is a neural-net processor... a learning computer.  But Skynet presets the switch to "read-only" when we are sent out alone.
It's not just a dream.  It's real, you moron! I know the date is happens!!
On August 29th 1997 it's going to feel pretty fucking real to you, too!  Anybody not wearing number two million sunblock in gonna have a real bad day, get it?
I guess you admire musicians.
What?
Steve.
I keep hearing you helped a lot of Jews to escape. How did you do that?
Did you call someone you knew?
Please stop playing these games with me. Why you should bring up the name of another conductor is beyond my understanding.
Good, and according to your questionnaire, Helmuth, you never joined the Nazi Party.
Was a member of...?  Speak up?
Oh, I see, he made you co-operate. And now are you a communist again?
You ever seen Adolf Hitler's eyes when he was making a speech? I've seen 'em on films.
Was looking at Furtwngler like that?
Here you go.  You're a Bob's Girl now.  Nancy will check you out.
I'm going to a movie, kiddo. See ya'.  You and Matt have a good time.
Didn't see the war.  I was born after, in the ruins.  Grew up there.  Starving.  Hiding from the H-K's.
Sleep.  It'll be light soon.
About what?
What's that?
Sarah.
Here, drink some of this...
Go!  Go!  He's got her.
I'm so sorry.
Let's talk to whoever can get this over with...
I'll wait.
Nice.
Take the picture out.
Take the picture out of the frame and show it to me.
My name's not Christine.  It's not my real...
Where'd you get that... ?
They gave me a free jacket at the door.
Not after I'm done with it.  Actually, I've been here.  In grad-school I bought crystal-meth from the maitre d'.
How did those... ?
The last few days, um... I've been thinking... had a lot of spare time.  I want to tell you... I'm starting to understand why you left me.  I've been resenting you for it, maybe, but ... I want to apologize, for all of it.  For shutting you out, for not being there.  I...  Anyway, I hope you can forgive me.
It would mean a lot to me... if you and I could be friends.  If I could have you back in my life... in some small way.  It would be important.
One guarantee.  Payment's entirely at your brother's discretion and, as a gift, dependent on your satisfaction.
It's never happened.  We've never had an unsatisfied customer.
I've been so lonely.
Don't be nervous.  They said you'd be nervous.
All the time I've known you, you've never once asked about him.
What the fuck... ?!
Christ... I can't believe it... invisible ink?
The children.  The children Hugh Crain built the house for.  The children he never had.
I gave my key to the gate to Todd, but the Dudleys'll be here in the morning.
We're fucked.  We're in a haunted house and we can't get out until the morning.
That depends on your definition of ghosts.  I'm going to check on her, and then I'm going to stay awake.
Yeah.
You wrote that you had trouble sleeping.
What is that tune?
You hear the vibrations in the wire.  There's a magnetic pulse in the wires, you feel it.  I could test it.
Your fear of him was real.  That's all the ghost anyone needs.
Why?
Yes.
Why?
A monster?  But he built this for the woman he loved, like the Taj Mahal.
That's so sad.
Nell, what happened?
Hey, I thought you weren't a buffet person.
I mean, Gordon must weigh a good four hundred pounds.
As it happens.  I didn't make that part up.
Who done it, then?
You should talk to Elaine.  That was her best friend.
She didn't know what to say.  I thought someone should say something. To someone.  With me it was, I don't know -- Jenny liked me for some reason.  I felt like I owed her.
Not me, man.  I'm no drug dealer, what you think.
I already told you, man.  Corcoran.  Know what that is?  State prison.
What's so fucking funny?
Hey, Elaine.  You even know what he's saying half the time?
Disappointed.
She never told anyone else.  About the convict strain -- or is it stain?  No, I was privileged.  I was someone who helped Jenny efface her past.
When I'm not honing my craft in episodic television I do double-duty as a voice coach.  Not that her accent would have hobbled her progress.  Not with that look.
Modelling.
Jenny was supposed to come to my place that night.  She called me, asked if she could come over.  She and Terry had been -- having some trouble.  Lately.  I don't know about what.  On this occasion, it reached some sort of crisis point.
She used to tell me she'd turn me in.  Little kid.  Ten year old.  "If you're naughty, Dad, I'll tell on ya."  She didn't want me sent down again, see. When I was planning some job.  "I'll tell 'em, Dad, I promise I will.  Here, look, I'm calling the Old Bill right now" -- picking up the telephone.  I can see her, the phone in her hand.  Became a sort of joke between us.  Only it wasn't a joke.
Been away a lot.
He's expecting you?
It's been five minutes and I'm packing to leave again.  I can't believe this.
...You don't like the music out there?
...I'm not certain I'll have a career at all, and if I do, I'll probably be a veterinarian.
I do appreciate the interest you've taken, though.
I'm only sorry that I didn't play better for you. I know it would've made you happy. You know what you are?
You're an enthusiast.
A goose, friend. I was chasing a wild goose. Ed, have you ever heard of venture capital?
Well, it's the wildest goose there is. Risk money. Very speculative. Except, Ed, in certain situations, it's not, see? I thought I had a prospect here. Well, I make the haul up and this lousy so-and-so tells me his situation has changed--all his capital's gonna be tied up in expansion plans of his own. Thank you, mother! Pop goes another bubble! It's only the biggest business opportunity since Henry Ford and I can't seem to interest a soul!
It's called dry cleaning. You heard me right, brother, 'dry cleaning'-- wash without water, no suds, no tumble, no stress on the clothes. It's all done with chemicals, friend, and your garments end up crisp and fresh. And here's the capper: no shrinkage.
...Yeah, that's it. As per our discussion.
Please, Ed.
Come on, get ready. It's important.
...My books used to be perfect. Anyone could open them up, make sense of the whole goddamn store.
Not guilty, your honor...
...Huh?
I don't work here. My wife does.
Yeah.
...How you today, Ed?
You don't got a headache?
...I'm Crane.
What'd he say? Does he understand?
I had no idea the Museum had a complete collection of Piranesi's Forum sketches.
I've read about the Museum's financial troubles.
Ippolito!  Get back here!
You think what we've got here is a monster as big as a house that smells... like hamburger?
Look.  It's some kind of letter.
What does it say?
What's that doing here?
I can't help thinking there's something that Pendergast overlooked.  If the scratches were made by whatever killed Beauregard, it wants something that's in here.
None of that matters now.  The people upstairs need us.  We have to help.
We think it may have something to do with the eggs we found in the crate.
And it snuffled the ground like a dog.
Jesus, what is this?
These plant fibers are loaded with hormones!
Where would we find it?
You'd slow us down and put Margo in danger.
We're not going to make the storage room!
Give me a shot from Truman's ring.
Not only does he give us a glimpse of the truth, he gives us a glimpse of ourselves.
We find many viewers leave him on all night for comfort.  Haven't you ever watched your child or your lover sleep?
I have a map.
I'm thinking of getting out, Marlon.
...personally I think the unconquered south face is the only one worth scaling...of course it's a 20,000 foot sheer wall of ice but then when did that ever stop me before?...Naturally, I intend to make the ascent without the benefit of oxygen but also without crampons or even an ice pick...<i>risks?</i>...  ...sure I'm aware of the risks--why else do you think I would spend seven years as an adjuster in a life insurance company...?
What did you want?
It's hard to go places, isn't it?
How are you, Mother?
How's your hip?
Do you live around here?
Special Agent Scully --
Yes.
You said you knew the location of the archeological site where these were found.
See this bullshit...? Somebody knows I'm talking to you.
What is it? Kiddie porn again? Sexual battery of a patient? I've had my license taken away in three states.
For what? Because I'm a dangerous man. Because I know too much about the truth.
You know my work?
Jesus, Mulder...
Scully?
You knew this man didn't die at the bomb site before we got here.
You're saying the bombing was a cover-up. Of what?
Mulder, this is going to take some time, and somebody's going to figure out soon enough we're not even supposed to be here.  I'm in serious violation of medical ethics.
Hey, I was right about the bomb, wasn't I?
I already gave Skinner my letter of resignation.
I can, Mulder. I debated whether or not to even tell you in person, because I knew --
You're on the verge, Mulder -- please don't do this to me --
I have. I did. It's done.
I'm contacting the state board Monday to file medical reinstatement papers --
General McAddie is who requested our coming here. We were awakened at three AM and told to get down here immediately.
Well, call General McAddie.
I'm quite prepared to tell you everything, though there isn't much you haven't guessed.
I think of it as an agreement. A word your father liked to use.
My god...
Miriam...
...a pocketful of rye.
Agent Novak?
He wants us to follow.  The little boy...
Thank you.
That's why we monitor the use of the drugs so closely.  We don't want her getting to that degree of perceptual disorientation.
Nervous?
How is she?
Ich weiss nicht.
Don't understand what Harry saw in a fellow like that.
Harry?
...to steal my girl.
What happened to your hand?
Have you seen Calloway?
Here, it will be cold on that train.
...parents.
Joseph Harbin's body was found in the coffin.
We are interested in this case. Have you arrested the girl?
Must have known I was broke. Even sent me an airplane ticket. It's a shame.
Him dying like that.
Miss Schmidt.
...be responsible for you in the streets.
Calloway, can't you do something about Anna?
...excuse me.
Do you know his number?
Seems exciting.
Hello, Harry.
Listen...
I want to talk to you.
Part? You can have any part you want, so long as you don't interfere...I have never cut you out of anything yet.
...you.
Find out?
Sehen sie da gleich da unter. Da unten ist est passiert. Passiert - English.
Oh, you did.
...this time.
You. You're the guy that lent me the money.
Ten dollars. I'll find a way to pay you back. How would you like to know About somewhere special? The perfect beach. Paradise. No one else knows about it. That's got to be worth something. What do you say?
Yea, OK. I will be, I will be, I promise.
Everyone ok?
Did you sleep well?
Do you know the Kentucky friend mouse story?"
Exactly. Always happened to someone else.
So there's an urban myth, well more of a rural myth, going around here at the moment. It's about a beach.
Didn't you see <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i>?
That was an ark, man. That was a Torah. They fucked around with it, and the Torah melted their faces.
How come you know all this shit?
Fuck you. I hate the Jews at least as much as you do.
You're not like the others, are you?... Your friends.
I want to learn to read it.
Know your enemy.... 'Cause it's a basic text of Western culture. I want to read it in the original. Okay?
You can't. Do you know how many people I've brought into...the movement...?
...I thought we agreed, no anti- Semitism...it's exactly what we're trying to put behind us.... Trash the blacks, fine; but...
Yes, of course. But that only plays in this room, with people who aren't embarrassed to call themselves Nazis. If you want a modern fascism, you don't mention Jews.
What about...Manzetti, the synagogues....
Why did you come tonight? To see me?
I thought you hated Torah.
How have things been going?
Where's Mrs. Moebius?
Oh, what is this shit?
Lie on your stomach and come up on your elbows.
The Torah says not to light a fire on the Sabbath, because it's work, correct?  But if alternating current's running through the wires every second of every day, and I throw a switch, send it here instead of there, how is that lighting a fire?
Are you out of your mind?!
And you...?  Do you love Enzo?
This is a great pleasure.
... It's easy.  You go down.  You come up.  ... Right, Johana?
Is he alright?  What happened?
Where did you get that?
I remember.  Hi Roberto!
I don't have one.
It's okay, Enzo.  I'll go somewhere else.
No.
You still collect them?
You don't have that one, do you?
You were right.
You're going to be very busy these days aren't you?
Can I come watch you dive tomorrow?
Bonjour Monsieur... Louis. 
Mayol... Mayol... No reservation.
What were Italians doing living in Greece anyway?
... And those?
What's that little air bottle on the machine?
But doesn't Jacques dive without anything?
Alright Mordechai, now that we're alone I just want to say that I'm not happy about this. I don't want a repeat of that incident in the West Bank.
A settlement completely demolished, ten smashed army jeeps, four dead Arabs. G dash D damn it, Hammer! You think you're above the Ten Commandments? Just find Santa Claus and bring him back to us. No heroics, got it?
You like my Mordechai, yes?
So, now what?
Oh my god. She's become my pimp. And she's whoring her bitch-son out to the highest bidder.
Let's let your tuchus breathe.
So Morde-chai, tell me, what brings your bad self down to the KLF?
How do we bypass it?
I shlepped all the way to the North Pole for this? I come to fight you, and you don't even put out anything to nosh on? What kind of arch nemesis are you?
Well, he's kinda just resting in the corner with his girlfriend.
This is for "mama and the kids."
Charlie wasn't drunk last night.
Cut.
And if you've got cold feet honey, Ill take over for you. That red dress of yours fits just perfect on me.
Come to look around?
It was you, Galbraith!
It was you.
You shot the leopard. We know that. You killed Consuelo. You killed Clo Clo. Then tonight --
Consuelo screamed too -- and Clo Clo. Why did you do it? Why? Quick. Tell me why?
Tell me.
You can go now, Manning. There is no way we can hold you legally responsible.
You won't go to Galbraith with me?
 As long as my feet held out.
Kiki -- it wasn't the leopard.
Good afternoon. De Moraess residence.
Im afraid they are out at the moment, sir.
How dare you...  You dont know this tape belongs to my brother, do you, Mr Lombard?
No. The question now is how long its going to take you to get out of here, Mr Lombard.
Get out of my house. Youre fired, Mr Lombard.
Are you all right?
Not yet. The place I hoped to find him turns out to be little more than a contact address. Ill give it 24 hours. He just might show up.  If you need to reach me ask for Mr Lamont. Paul Lamont, all right?
What do you mean, No, Mrs De Moraes?
Does the name Pierre Dreyer mean anything to you? Hes a client of mine and a friend of your husband.
Adonis thought your brothers bodyd be found reasonably quickly when he hung it in Epping Forest, didnt he? Seemed like a good idea. An ex-junkie, obsessed with death; the perfect candidate for suicide. He just forgot one thing: forest ramblers are rare during your average blustery English November. An Englishman might have thought of that, but a Brazilian...
Leons not found, your parents worry, talk of hiring help to find him, even mention their manhunter friends perhaps... and Adonis panics, takes control, brings me in reckoning a small- time detective is unlikely to dig up anything awkward, not before Leons found anyhow. He must have kicked himself when he learned Id exceeded his expectations.
I... We have to bury Leon tommorrow...
Okay. The woman just cant walk away...  I want straight answers. No hesitation or I walk for sure. Why cant you go to your Embassy?
A little too tight, eh?  ...They were my sons. Only thirteen and already six feet tall. A real lanky boy...  I... Theres some cold chicken salad in the fridge if youre hungry.
Right... Well, Ill get your money first thing in the morning, okay?  Okay. Goodnight then.
Theyd never let me go. And youd end up in more trouble than you know for helping me.
Where is the Austrian?
Hello again, neighbour. I didnt intrude, did I?
Fine. How was the match? Did you loose?
Must be your lucky day then. Ive got your accounts - you dont owe much tax for last year.
Lombard, this is not a Jewish name, is it?
What if it is?
The rooms yours for 24 hours. Its sound- proofed, stocked up with food, drink and other things you might find useful. You can do anything you like.
You know what, Martin? I ought to tie you down with your old arse up in the air and advertise the hole in the middle of it to the world. Free. And hope you never die.
Evening. Table for one?
Leon? No. Im afraid he left.
No. I meant he left as in no longer works here.
Im sorry...
The money Leon left for the boy, was it cash?
Did he mention anything about having an exhibition of his work?
You sure? What about before he turned up with the boy?
Bye. And thanks... Nathalie gently closes the door, eyes Lombard who shakes himself awake... rolls her eyes and surveys the room...
Mon bureau cotait trop cher.
Moreau? Cest moi. Alors...
They lost their son. Why?
Are they still operative?
Mossad?
What do you fear most now... my sword?  ... or his hands?
What's going on?!
If you really want to help me, there's one thing you can do.
... and maybe the king will give you some money, and a little land, and a title even...  ... wouldn't that be a fine thing? You, a lady of title!
No, you must come, Jeanne -- we need you -- so much has happened since you left... I have a new horse now, a white one, just like yours... and La Hire hardly swears at all anymore...  You can't stay -- they'll burn you!
W-w-what are you doing?!
Are you alright?  Did they hurt you?
Jeanne -- be careful -- you're not helping yourself by refusing to submit to our judgment...
I don't understand, Jeanne... why did you do it?  Why?
I know, Jeanne... it was the only way to save you from the fire!
... and what... what did he say?
I... I don't know... it'll sound like we... betrayed her...?
"Be patient, be patient"... is that the only advice you can ever come up with??  I've shown more patience than a dozen saints!
Ah, so that's it.  To you I'm just a girl.
God... why of course -- we'd forgotten about him!  Strange, I don't seem to remember seeing him at Agincourt.
Jeanne... The men are exhausted!
Jeanne... we're not enough...
Jesus Christ... the goddamn English will pay for this!
You don't believe me anymore?
Why were you yelling like that?!
Why?  Are you waiting for someone else?
My voices... my voices... do you think they will ever come back?
Are you going to leave me too?
Beautiful.
Hello.
Who are you?
When's your baby due?
Have you seen this?
They bombed us, we're off the air.
What are you reading?
Puppydog, what d'you mean, you forgot?
You know what? You treat me like dirt!
Pig!
Pig!
Dirty pig!
I'm sorry, I did my best, I thought the certificates would save us all.
What about you?
I'll play the piano again. On Polish radio.
Szpilman.
And with time she will, I'm sure, become affectionate.
Go Peini ... Haere atu e Peini.
I'll have to come and hear you play. what do you play.
What did she say?
And when is the next lesson?
Yeh, go ahead.
You're late.  Where you been?
How much did ya lose?
In one goddamn night?  What are ya sprayin' money around like that for? You coulda been nailed.
You're a con man, and you blew it like a pimp.  I didn't teach ya to be no pimp.
No class grifter woulda' done it, that's all.
How do you like that Coleman, huh? After three years.
We were partners.  If it weren't for Luther I'd still be hustlin' pinball down at Gianelli's.  I don't need anything more than I got.
There's always a depression on.
I like griftin'.
I don't look any good in clothes and I don't know how to drive. What else ya got to sell, Eirie?
Been a while since I stocked a wire store.  Not many mobs playing that anymore.
All right, I'll rent ya everything I got in the warehouse for two grand.  That'll give ya phones, cages, blackboards and ticker gear. You supply the guys to move 'em. If you want a counter and bar, that's another grand.  I don't know where the hell I'm gonna get 'em though.
You want the stuff tomorrow or don't ya?  It's gonna take hours just to clean it up.  Besides, Gondorff's still a hot item.  Where am I gonna be if he gets hit?
He's waitin' for you in the card room.
You know how easy it'd be for one of Lonnegan's guys to nail you?
You just won't learn, will ya. Hell, you come in here, I teach you stuff maybe five guys in this world know, stuff most grifters couldn't do even if they knew it, and all you wanna do is run down a bullet.  You're just like all them new jerks. Lotsa nerve and no brains.  And ten years from now when me and the others are through and you dumb guys are all dead there won't be one gee left who knows the Big Con was anything more than a way to make a livin'.
Looks like he's sulking.
Raise 1,000.
Excuse me, sir.  Treasury Dept... I'd like to ask you a few questions.
We don't doubt that, but there's a counterfeiting operation passing bad money in the station.  Have you made any purchases here today?
I don't even know you.
What's the matter?  You gotta get back to Shaw?
What happened to your face?
Yeh, and what if we play tomorrow and he doesn't come up with the money.  We risk our whole operation for nothing.  I'll say when we make our bets.
There's a physiological as well as a psychological angle in my father's relationship with Julia Wolf that the police have overlooked.  And I think it explains everything.  You see, my father was a sexogenarian.
Yes.  He admitted it.
Why not?
Then just say he was sixty years old.
What?
That isn't true.  It was about your father.  Where is he?
No.
That's gone long ago.  I've got to see him.  Where is he?
You know, we know each other.
Aren't you Nick Charles?
Hello, Dorothy. 
You can take that out to the car.
Yes.
Not at all.
Have you got a pistol permit?
Get anything?
I know he'll turn up as soon as he sees this in the papers.  You can't think he had anything to do with it, Mr. Guild.  He wasn't the kind of man that....
I didn't know they had a fight.
Mr. Guild means guests!  Oh, there are two more to come.
We're just having a little drink.
One hundred...  two hundred... three...
I wish you'd count them.  There's a thousand dollars there.
Isn't there anything else I can do for you? Have you bought your ticket?
Well, let me do that for you.
But it must have been Wynant.  I should have known if it weren't his voice.
You did... where?
Oh, did he?  What did he say?
You might have mentioned me first.
She didn't tell me a thing.
I wish that doctor'd come.  How do you feel?
What's the trouble, Asta?  Your balloon busted?  So's mine.
The mystery's all gone. And I wanted you to find out who did it.
But Wynant --- ?
Why don't you?
So am I.
Serve the nuts - I mean, serve the guests the nuts.
I'm sorry...  but...
I just wanted to tell you...
It's a map, I think that's what it is.
You two fighting's not going to get us anything.
Not much of a pass.
You ready?
I don't care what he says, he wanted our gold.  Would have slit our throats if he had the chance.
Wes, we thought you were dead, and we thought we were next.  Hanging around to get killed wouldn't have done anyone any good.
Wes--
Don't worry about Jaeger.  He uses his personality as a form of birth control.
It's war.  People get lost all the time in war, cut off--
Figure they don't want to mess with us anymore than we want to mess with them.
What!?
When we start running suck up your breath.  You're going to get the wind knocked out of you.
Not enough.  We're out numbered and out gunned.  They'd cut us to shreds.
It's just a mongoose.
We got to go back.  We got to go back for Wes.
We can't just leave him.
What if he's not?
We can't just sit here.  We've got to start moving, so pick.
Slip out your M-16.
And then shoot them.
Can you ride a horse?
Woods.
I'm looking for a favor.  I need a map of Iraqi.
What is this?
We...we could go home with something else.
Yeah!  Yeah!
Jesus!  What the hell did he do that for? They're Iraqis.  Why are Iraqis killing Iraqis?
With what?  He doesn't have a weapon.
A sinex drop reading of less then 2000 degrees with an accompanying loss of greater then 350 degrees since admission may indicate....?
Then why did you bring it up?
I can't go on like this.  I can't....  I don't just sit around and watch people.  If I make a mistake, it's all over.  You see it every day.  Do you want to see me taken away in pieces?
You always manage to avoid the issue:  What's wrong with our present condition?  We're COMFORTABLE and we have plenty of food...I feel absolutely no threat because there is no threat. Why incite trouble?  You should examine your emotions.  It is senseless...
We must escape.  We have plans. We can leave.  We must wait until...
I'm leaving.
This one has eyes.  Why did they leave your eyes? Could you ever....
Yes.
Yes.
Where did you get this?
Nice performance back there. Where'd you learn that, Mike Ditka Sensitivity Seminar?
No you look, mister! First, you don't go calling my men names. It's bad for morale. Second, us "punks" happen to know a heck of alot more about police work than any vice cop ever did.
How long were you hooked?
Good, now the other side.
You got it.
Relax, Pooch, it's just a ticker, it's not personal.
What's the matter?
You were lucky today, vice boy. Captain said to leave it alone, but just remember, I'm watching you.
That guy's wife must be pretty pissed off to play a trick like that.
Why don't you just shoot it and put it out of its misery?
I thought you said what's-her-name's brother was going to fix it.
What was it this time?
A what?
Sir...
on staircase; from Gaston's point of view. He stops.
The representative of the police wants to know if there is anything wrong with your tonsils.
<u>Niente!</u>
It must be the most marvelous supper. We may not eat it, but it must be marvelous.
And, waiter--you see that moon?
I want to see that moon in the champagne.
I want to see-- 
And as for you, waiter--
I don't want to see you at all!
Do you <u>know</u> King Boris?
Do you know the Marquis de la Tours?
You'd better not. He's really very dull. But anyhow, when the king tells the marquis he saw me, the marquis will tell the marchesa. And the marchesa is the best friend of the Duchess of Chambro. And <u>she</u> will phone the Princess de Costa. The princess doesn't like me--but I don't care!
You! And she's willing to pay as high as fifty francs!
One purse--  empty. One vanity case-- 
Please, Madame Colet, I believe in doing things correctly. Shall we continue?  Two hairpins, one cigarette lighter, one box of real matches, and-- Oh, yes, this letter from Major--
Naturally I did.
You needn't be embarrassed, madame. A lady as charming as you would, and <u>should</u>, get love letters.
But one suggestion, madame.  Not the major.  I don't  mind his grammatical mistakes. I'll overlook his bad punctuation. But the letter has no mystery--no bouquet--no ...  And one lipstick ...  Scarlet number four.
With your skin, I prefer crimson.
That's what you need!
What shade of powder do you use?
That's too dark.
But you have an engagement, and I don't want people to talk.
Precisely.
No--yours, madame.
Goodbye...
It could have been marvelous ...
Wonderful ... But tomorrow morning, if you should wake out of your dreams and hear a knock, and the door opens, and there, instead of a maid with a breakfast tray, stands a policeman with a warrant--then you'll be glad you're alone.
Lovely.
Well, in times like these most people are cutting salaries, but suppose we say, in your case, three hundred and fifty?
Mr. Andrews, thank God! Where would the Master at Arms take someone under arrest?!
No! I'll do this with or without your help, sir. But without will take longer.
Bottom, left, right. I have it.
Hey, Lizzy. I need to talk to you for a second.
Look, I'm running out of time. I need your help.
What could possible be funny?
My God... Cal. Is it a --
I know.  Perhaps you could join us for dinner tomorrow, to regale our group with your heroic tale?
How you two doin'?
Why have we stopped?
Well, do you think the ship is seriously damaged?
Mr. Dawson, I --
Jack... I feel like such an idiot. It took me all morning to get up the nerve to face you.
Here I am. I... I want to thank you for what you did. Not just for... for pulling me back. But for your discretion.
Look, I know what you must be thinking! Poor little rich girl. What does she know about misery?
I don't... it wasn't just one thing. It was everything. It was them, it was their whole world. And I was trapped in it, like an insect in amber.  I just had to get away... just run and run and run... and then I was at the back rail and there was no more ship... even the Titanic wasn't big enough. Not enough to get away from them. And before I'd really though about it, I was over the rail. I was so furious. I'll show them. They'll be sorry!
Oh God, I am such an utter fool.
Penguin? Oh, Cal! He is them.
I saw that in a nickelodeon once, and I always wanted to do it.
What is it? A sapphire?
Don't you believe it, Rose. Don't!
You must do me this honor... promise me you will survive... that you will never give up... no matter what happens... no matter how hopeless... promise me now, and never let go of that promise.
Never let go.
It's been 84 years...
Anya!
Feeling a little better, I see.
--that's what we call double-a grade lumber, ma'am; You don't find a knot in a thousand feet.
Aces full.
Where have you been hiding?
Don't thank me. Do you recognize me without the lipstick?
How about giving me another coat?
Wait a minute!--They're dancing in the palm court--
There's soft music--
What are you thinking?
That's funny--so was I.  Guess the ocean makes one sentimental
Well, I'll be--!!!
Just a minute, steward--haven't you forgotten something?
My change.
Say--wait a minute!
I'm going to the show--
Thought you might need me--don't talk, kid, and don't let him scare you-- 
I won't--I'll ask for one right now.  Sally tells me she's in love with you.
Yes--but don't ask me why--because I could never tell you. I don't know what most guys want out of life--but <U>that</U> would be enough for me--I wouldn't care about-- easy money--or--showing off my smart brains--I'd just like to live <U>my</U> life so nothing I did would bounce back and ruin <U>hers</U>--Do I make myself clear?
O.K., kid--  I'm only sorry for one thing.
I can see where I won't talk much to you.
Those kids seem to be getting along fine!--
He's a likable chap--he's got an honest face--
I'll give you another chance to tell the truth, Lother.
Why don't you be a good little boy and leave her alone?
I just tried to show her the difference between the squirrels and the skunks.
You're wasting your time--she's a friend of mine.
He works the boats as a "come-on" man. We ought to make a fair combination and do a little business. Jack's a pretty good dealer himself.
Go ahead--you didn't used to be so fussy--
Don't be a mug all your life--I'm trying to help you-- you need me more than I need you--have you figured they might pick the kid up in France and extradite him?
He's certainly good-natured.
I mean--a lot of gentlemen would be offended if you searched them like that.
God damn son of a...
Just pick up your money and go. Sick of listening to you simper.
Easy.  I just wanted to tell you Things're about to start changing Around here.  Lots of so-called Hard cases and tough-nuts swagger Around this town but none of 'em's got a clue about the real play.  None of 'em.
Come on, you...
On three?  You call it.
Doc!  How the hell are you?
Wyatt!  Just in time.  Pull up a chair.
Nonsense, I have not yet begun to Defile myself.
I won't be pawed at, thank you Very much
Don't touch me!
But I'd do it, I'd get that one Into him.  So help me God, I would.
We've never actually met.  My Name's-
Sorry about your friend.  And I'm sorry about...
No, stay.  Please stay with me.
Oh, all right.
No, no, I don't want to keep you.
Just go.  It's all right.  Wyatt, Really.  Work well.
I ain't your brother, I ain't None of your damn brothers.  Move!
Really?  What about hell?  They got A sign or what?
Get down, boy.
What's it look like?  They want a Piece of me they can come and get It, I'm not crawlin' into my hole.
I am usin' it, Wyatt.  Been Wonderin' how the hell we got in This tangle.  You know they hit Clum's house, too?  Shot up his wife. His wife.  Who ever heard of That?  Men sneakin' around in the Dark, back-shootin', scarin' Women?  They're bugs, Wyatt.  You Know all your smart talk about Live and let live?  Ain't no live And let live with bugs.
We should get moving.
Maybe I jumped the gun.  Maybe Those Cowboys aren't near as bad As they're painted.  You know I Was thinkin', there's a lot of Money in the cattle business...
Business is business.  Don't have To love 'em to work with 'em.  Not If there's money in it.
... What were you saying, Admiral? Something about this 'not being a job for a wine-sniffing, skirt-chasing playboy spy?'
How did you get this number?
...And what's that, my dear?
By the way, James: Ordinarily I would never ask, but... Weren't you and that Colonel once stranded on a raft for two weeks in the Sargasso Sea?
Oh, James. I've missed you -
Stop it! You're hurting me! Can't you just be nice?
There is one last thing, 007: Elliot Harmsway is vital to the economic interests of this nation. He's also a major contributor to the party. I expect him to be given every consideration.
What do you want with the Harbor Master?
... Does this do anything?
I hope you'll be gentle.
What the hell does that do?
... Yes???
... Yes?
And number two?
And when might that be?
...I'll give you a ring from Venice.
My name is Sidney Winch, and -
I know my rights. These are international waters. The British Navy abandoned that boat, and I'm claiming it. Under international law, I have the right to salvage what's on that wreck.
I was an attorney!
No.
...Well! I do believe this requires further investigation!
They're on the bridge. Seal off the 50th floor!
Will it go off?
Why in the hell didn't you help mama?
I bet you if your master would have told you to fix the hole in the roof, you would have rebuilt the whole damn house.
That is a damn lie and you know it. Every time father asks you to do something, you either half-ass do it or run off and hide. Mama asked you to turn the dirt in her garden and you told her, with your smart ass self, that you weren't a farmer; get Junior to do it. Every time someone asks you to do something, you always say, tell Junior to do it. Boy, you ought to grow up.
I have more sense than to give up everything, my family, you and Sunny. It wasn't me, I mean the real me inside my body. I'm glad it's over. It's like a veil has been lifted.
It's like I've been swimming in muddy waters.
It was like all those things old country people try to tell you what hell is like.
I couldn't believe the things I was doing. It was like an internal struggle going on inside my body.
It was nip and tuck.
I could swear I heard my son call me.
Let us go back in before the night of celebration becomes a night of me killing my son.
Man, put your boxes down and stay as long as you like. We have empty rooms since the boys got their own families and moved out.
One can tell you are from back home. These people nowadays don't know what manners are.
Good afternoon, ladies.
None of your business.
You know Harry lied about how that boy Hocker got kilt. And it was Harry who saw Emory last before they found him hanging over a levee like someone would hang a hog.
Can we leave this up 'til we move?
Yeah!
Mom, have you seen Woody?
Right here in the van.
Whoooooah!  Oh!  Bo!  There's gotta be a less painful way to get my attention.
And another thing.  Stop with this spaceman thing.  It's getting on my nerves.
Buzz!  Buzz, come back!
Woody, we don't know what's out there!
Come on, this way!
Ha-ha!!
Something's screwy here.
Sid, give her back!  Give her back now!  I'm telling!
Well, obviously she wanted to have the party before the move.  I'm not worried.  You shouldn't be worried.
No!  No!  Don't leave!  Don't leave! You've gotta help us, please!  You don't know what it's like over here!
What the heck is up there?
There.
Hey, Slinky?
You'll need to know who we are, we're the brothers of his wife, which makes us in an unsanctified kind of way, your uncles. Me name is Finn, me brother is called Francie -
Don't fret. It's only his dream. Dreams aren't catching, not like measles.
You <i>are</i> cold. Where have you been?
They're going to fly everywhere. Mean things. They should have taken us.
I'm not too young. Juliet was my age.
What?  What is it?
This place is swept twice a day.  I learned that in Miami in '85.  Then the U.S. shut down the whole Caribbean, but it's a big game of wack-a-mole.  Knock it down in Miami, it pops up here.  And San Diego is so much more relaxing.
Helena, if I had it I would give it to you, but I don't have that kind of money.
Yes, I told you before, there are people who owe you money but they're not paying.  There's too much heat on Carl.
Arnie, do think there's a difference between a reason and an excuse, because I don't think there is.
My Leica's gone.
We'll get through this, I promise. I'll make it up to you --
Helena --
Inhale the smoke and hold it.
You should see little Montel play. Little Montel is the next Maradona.
He won.  He was a winner.  That bothers you.
You were followed by the police, but they won't hear us over the children. I want to use a bomb.
I don't really like guns.  You shoot someone in the head three times and some doctor will keep them alive.
I don't know.  Eduardo Ruiz is the only real witness against Carl.  The security is very tight.  There may not be a way.
I want to know who is responsible for this treatment.
We aren't barbarians.
Bring this man a change of good clothes.  Has he eaten?
If you want her to stay out of it, then stop telling her everything. You should learn how to keep a secret.
What's your name?
I'm looking for my daughter, Caroline. She comes here.
Salazar's been taken down.  He was working for Porfirio Madrigal.
Apparently not.  Look, it's a shit storm here right now.  When are you coming back?  I don't know what to tell people any more.
I don't know, maybe I'll buy something for my ma, and then buy some good speed, no bicarb like, then get a girl, take her out like, and treat her -- properly.
No, I don't mean like that -- I mean something nice, like, that's all --
This was his nightmare. The dodgiest scam in a lifetime of dodgie scams being perpetrated with three of the most useless and unreliable fuck-ups in town. I knew what was going on in his mind: any trouble in London and he would dump us immediately, one way or another. He had to. If he got caught with a bagful of skag, on top of that armed robbery shit, he was going down for fifteen to twenty. Begbie was hard, but not so hard that he didn't shite it off twenty years in Saughton.
What do you want?
Yes.
Yes, as a matter of fact, it is.
No.
Well, it isn't.
You're too young.
No, actually I went to Craignewton but I was worried that you wouldn't have heard of it so I put the Royal Edinburgh College instead, because they're both schools, right, and we're all in this together, and I wanted to put across the general idea rather than the details, yeah? People get all hung up on details, but what's the point? Like which school? Does it matter? Why? When? Where? Or how many O grades did I get? Could be six, could be one, but that's not important. What's important is that I am, right? That I am.
Only to get my foot in the door. Showing initiative, right?
You Only Live Twice?
Running time?
Director?
Screenwriter?
Fuck off! He never wrote any of them.
Why?
Why would I want to sell my passport?
It's the great outdoors.
It's fresh air.
I couldn't help but notice you pain.
Mr. Chekov, I've lost the Bird of Prey. She must have cloaked.
But the shuttle-
Where did you get this power?
I feel as if a weight has been lifted from my heart. How can I repay you for this miracle?
What is it you seek?
A starship? There are no starships on Nimbus III.
But how?
Standard orbit, Mr. Sulu.
Respond with static. Let them think we're having difficulty. Which wouldn't be far from the truth.
"Pack Up Your Troubles."
He rejected his logical upbringing and embraced the animal passions of our ancestors.
You mean he's your brother brother?  You made that up!
You did too. Sybok couldn't possibly be your brother because I happen to know for a fact that you don't have a brother.
There, you see? See?
Spock... the booster rockets.
No! No reply. Remain on course.


Spock, you've developed a sense of humor after all.
Dillinger?
For what?
I'm your program?
That was uncalled-for.
Flynn!!
You're alive!
The MCP blasted it... There are very few domains left with any power at all.
He was disoriented in transport, Tron.
I'm afraid it's a little late for that. Dillinger's shut off Group 7 access. He must know what you're up to.
Yes...acknowledge, Master Control...
Yes...it can take us across the Sea of Simulation... all the way out of the Game Grid...to the MCP.
Dinner's in the warmer.  Tell your father I may be late.
Immediate roll.  Acquire subject at K Street and Key Bridge.     * Vehicle is red-and-white      * convertible.  You have six minutes.
Kids.  Ten seconds of joy. Thirty years of misery.
What?  It's on the way.  She says she's got something for me.
Abu Kaleem Malik.
She's lying.
I'd like to remind you that it has been ten years since you were actually in one of these.
So your clients want something for the lobby of their new corporate headquarters?
I'm late.
...and I'm troubleshooting it with them over the phone... talking to a translator, right, who's getting half of it wrong... it was unbelievable...  really wild.
Uh huh.
I don't know.  I guess I needed something...
Harry, what's the matter with you?  Tell them the truth.  We're married, we have a daughter--
Not yet.  But we'll find him.
Beat it.
Yes.  I suppose so.  Where?
You see what I mean?  That reaction would give us away in a second.  Try to relax.
Let me speak to Clarence.
Tell him not to eat anything. We're gonna scarf when we get there.
Where's your car? I'll walk you to it.
You took a cab to see three kung fu movies?
Nothing. It's just you're a girl after my own heart.
'Bout twelve.
No. Not particularly.  How come?
I love to get pie after a movie.
Oh, you look so cute as little Elvis.
No no no no no no no no no...
I thought it was what you wanted, Clarence.
What?
Live with what?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I can't believe what you're tellin' me.
You'd really do that?
Look, Elvis, he is hauntin' me. He doesn't deserve to live. And I do want to kill him. But I don't wanna go to jail for the rest of my life.
If I thought I could get away with it -
Clarence sent a letter?
Clarence...
I'd fuck Elvis.
When he was alive. I wouldn't fuck him now.
Well, I guess it's about that time.
Oh, Mr. Donowitz -
OK, sorry, Lee. I just wanna tell you "Coming Home in a Body Bag" is one of my favorite movies. After "Apocalypse Now" I think it's the best Vietnam movie ever.
You know, most movies that win a lot of Oscars, I can't stand. "Sophie's Choice", "Ordinary People", "Kramer vs. Kramer", "Gandhi". All that stuff is safe, geriatric, coffee-table dog shit.
Look, I don't know this is pretty heavy-duty, so if you wanna explode, feel free.
I'm me... I mean, that's me.
Suspect's words -
You OK? That stupid dumb-ass didn't break your nose, did he?
You gotta hold this for me.
Just put it in your purse.
They won't search you. I promise. You haven't done anything.
Please, they'll be here any minute. Just put it in your bra.
Put it in your pants.
You're the one who wanted to drive fast.
Women will want to get to know you...
That's him.
It's just a shot to calm you.
Look, I'm warning you.  You do anything, I'm going to go crazy -- hurt people!
You were going to run out off gas on purpose, weren't you?
You want me to rob him?
Does this bother you, Mr. Cole?
Who would you call, Mr. Cole, who would straighten everything out?
So you could talk to these scientists and they do what?  Send you to the future?
County Hospital, right?  1989.  The "Immaculate Escape" -- am I right?  Why, thank you -- you look wonderful, too.
We need to talk.  Come on.  Upstairs.  I am a new person!  I'm completely adjusted.  Witness the tux.  It's Armani.  Who chattered?  Goines?  Weller?
Don't be defensive, Kathryn, this isn't an inquisition.
He should have been in restraints.  It was bad judgment on your part, plain and simple.  why not just cop to it?
Two policemen were already in the hospital and now we have an orderly with a broken arm and a Security Officer with a fractured skull.
Nine thirty
Tight?  My watch says 7:30.
What?  What did you say?
I'll take a piece of that bet. I say it doesn't come up five times each side.
Nothing.
Please, you don't understand.  I have to get out of here.  They're going to come looking for me. They're going to kill me.  If I can't get this ticket then I'm going to have to do things to get out of here.  I don't want to hurt anybody, I just want to leave.
Then you're only a hundred-forty- five in the hole.  Now why don't you just take your Visa Express Silver Card, call Karl Malden and have him send you the money lickity split.
Now that's too bad.  I sure hope you know how to wash dishes or shovel shit 'cause you're gonna have to work this one off.
Poor thing.  Is she all right?
That wasn't so bad.  What's thirty- some-thousand to rich folks like you?  It didn't hurt a bit.
My mother told me never to accept offers from strangers.
Do you have to call me that?
Maybe I don't want you to.
You're pretty full of yourself, aren't you?
It's Grace.
Must get kind of lonely for a woman living by herself in a big house.
What do you do anyway?
Where'd you learn to do that?
A medicine man?
Nice house for a Shaman's daughter. You must be good.
All this nothing?  I've spent my life in this stinking desert.  It doesn't get to Jake like it got to me.  He doesn't mind being out here. He doesn't mind being nothing but a land broker.  Big fish in a small pond, he says.  More like a little fish in a dried up watering hole.
I don't know how.
It's not that easy.  Maybe you can take chances; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please.  I can't.  I don't want to be alone.  I need to know I'm going to be taken care of.
Is that so bad?  It's not like I wouldn't try to make him happy.  For awhile, anyway.  I mean, I would . . . do things for him.  I guess I'm no good that way.  I guess I tried to sucker you along like that.  Do you hate me for it?  I wouldn't blame you if you did.  But maybe it's like you said:  You just got to do whatever it takes to get out.
There's easily a hundred-thousand in there.  More than that.
I shot him.
He was going to take the money.
John, if you don't throw me the keys, then I'll just walk away. Walk away and leave you here.
Someone will find me.
You idiot!  You'll kill us both!
For Christ's sake, John!  Throw me the keys!
Good Lord.  What happened to you?
Another accident?  You've really got to be more careful.  Can I get you a drink?
Hungry?
I'm surprised to see you.  I thought you'd be halfway to Vegas by now.
Maybe not this time, but somebody's going to get dead around you.
You like Patsy Cline?  I just love her.  How come, I wonder, she don't put out no more new records.
Gee, that's sad.  Don't that make you sad?
You're not from around here, are you?  Where you from?
You ain't from Oz.  Oz is in that one movie.
Oh, that tears it, Mister.  I'm gonna bust you up but good.  I'm gonna bust you into a million pieces and then . . . and then bust those pieces up, and then . . . and then spread them all around.  That's what I'm gonna do.  You don't know what you're dealing with, Mister.  I'm crazy.  I'm psycho crazy.
Saw you at the truck stop this morning.  You're not from around here.
Just curious.  That's a nasty cut you've got.
There was a young man over at Jamilla's today when it got hit. Way she tells it he got whacked around by one of the robbers.
That's too bad.  I was hoping you were there.  Maybe you could help us catch the guy who got away.  Or maybe you could explain about all that money that got tore up when Jamilla shot that biker.
Stay as long as you like, son.  No rush.
No police.
No police!  Wait until I'm gone.
Ain't over yet.  Night is part of day; separate, but equal.  Night is when you let your guard down; when you see things in the shadows and hear things in the dark.
Night is when you want to sleep, but the dry heat keeps you tossin' and turnin'. It's when you wish the sun was bakin' high in the sky so you could see what it is you're afraid of.
Afraid of it?  Boy, I live in the dark. All cause of a woman who made me this way. People are afraid of what they can't see. I can't see nuthin', so it's all the same to me.  Kiss from a beautiful woman, kissy kissy kiss, a lick from a dog, slurp, slurp, the kiss of death . It's all the same to me.
More or less.
Nothing makes the Great Spirit laugh harder than a man's plans. We all got plans. I planned on seeing all my life. I know you didn't plan on straying into town.
Well, don't say I didn't warn you when things go your way.
Now, what's this?
Mexico?  You going to Mexico?
Would you?
Next time you'll do just fine.
You like Patsy Cline?  I just love her. How come, I wonder, she don't put out no more new records.
Gee, that's sad.  Don't that make you sad?
You're not from around here, are you? Where you from?
You ain't from Oz.  Oz is in that movie.
Twenty-after-ten.
What the fuck did you do to my trunk?
And you had to go into the trunk, didn't you?
No, I've got it.
Accident.
You can let go of me now. I'm safe. How do they look?
Get out of town, Bobby, as quick as you can.
You'd never understand.
It's just such a mess. With Jake I mean...
I wanted to talk.
What about us?
Except I can't get you out of my head, Grace. 
Why?  Am I making you hot, or does the truth scare you?
I mean it, Grace.  I'm getting out of here, and I want to take you with me.
I could if I had Jake's money.
Why?
And I love you too.
How about Ciudad Juarez? You could take a local, arrives in two hours, and transfer in Albuquerque. It'll get you across the border.
One way, or round trip?
Anybody hurt?
Jake, don't go out there. Call the sheriff.
Yes?
No sir he is not.  I read about you in the paper.
I was in an accident once too. A horse almost trampled me to death.
...I can't remember.
Oh. Elijah Price came to visit me at the center today.
What's he talking about?
I got you a seat in the seven hundred level.  It's nose-bleed territory, but at least you won't get spit on.
Probably the army jacket. Those guys carry hunting knives and stuff for show.
I am. I'm helping him with the sale.
He's spoken of you. He says you're becoming friends.
No.
No Jeremy.
Don't be scared.
Twelve years.
If they was just here for the fuckin', how come they lit out the back window?
He didn't say nothin', huh?
Free ones?
Oh. Yeah.
We got one of them fuckers, Sheriff, out by Cow Creek, we...
Hell, yeah. A bunch of us Bar T boys went out lookin' on account of them killin' one of our own. We come across this fucker on a roan goin' South an'...
No... but I guess he will soon enough. Had a Spencer rifle on him an' he was...
Uh... a little, maybe.
I don't... deserve this... to die this way. I was... building a house.
R-r-r-really? You r-r-really w- wwant...?
You're Pete Sothow's nephew, huh? Hell, I thought maybe you was someone come to kill me...  ...for somethin' I done in the old days.
Yeah, I guess so.
Maybe I ain't.
Say, Bill. That business in Jackson County... did that really happen? I mean how they say it happened?
An' how there was two deputies up close pointin' rifles at you... had you dead to rights... an' how you pulled out a pistol an' blew them both away to hell... an' only took a scratch yourself.  Uncle Pete told me he never seen nothin' like it, shootin' your way out of a scrape like that.
You're gonna lose your share. If you don't...
It's a hell of a thing, ain't it, killin' a man. You take everythin' he's got... an' everythin' he's ever gonna have...
How long you gonna be, Bill?
Shit.
You want the Spencer, Bill? 
I was only checkin' it for you. Thought maybe somethin' was bent.
Well, you was shootin' every which way an'...
He's gonna die, ain't he?
Well, suppose he does?
That ain't what I mean.
I can't spot 'em myself but you could. That red-haired one, you could spot a half-mile off, I bet.
I'll ride up close an' shoot 'em!
I told you I'm a damn killer. I done it before.  I'm more killer than him.
Now remember, this is another kind of business. They don't earn your respect. You owe it to them. Don't stare them down but don't look away either. Confidence. They are fools not to trust you. That's the attitude.
Forget him. It's not important. I was trying to make a point.
You heard right.
How do you do?
How are they going to do it?
Fenster and Hockney?
Three million?
No killing?
My employer requires your services. One job. One day's work. Very dangerous. I don't expect all of you to live, but those who do will have ninety-one million dollars to divide any way they see fit.
My employer wishes to remain anonymous.
A little of both.
That's crazy, Dave and it doesn't matter. He has total immunity and his story checks out. He doesn't know what you want to know.
That was all Fenster and McManus.
You're stalling, Verbal.
No...
Why did he go to see Mary Rooney?
What did he find?
How good's your intelligence?
And so what is the rest of his case aside from Dr. Thompson?
No, actually, she was referred to me.  She was Dr. Hagman's patient...
I did.
Please sit down.  I told your wife. I'm sorry that we have to meet out here.  I've got a case coming in two days in the  Superior Court and my office is a mess of papers.
Dr. Thompson...?
They called, they're going to settle, what I want to do is build up as much ...
The Archdiocese called, they want to settle ... her estate ...
Yes.
Now, have you boys tried to resolve your little difficulty because that certainly would save the Commonwealth a lot of time and bother.
I'm sure it is, Frank:  and let me tell you something.  If we find it so complex, how in the hell you think you're going to make a jury understand it?   See my point?  Let's talk a minute. Frank: what will you and your client take right now this very minute to walk out of here and let this damn thing drop?
Nothing further, your Honor...
Why don't you get some rest?
You can't work if you can't think. You get in bed.  It's all right. I'll stay here with you.  It's all right.  Come on...
I have to talk to you.
Come on.  Let's get a drink.
Yeah?  How's our new witness?
She's workin' the late shift at the Hospital.  She's at home now, I'm going over there to talk to...
What are you doing in New York...?
I've been meaning to come in a long time.
Uh-huh.  My nephew's going to be staying with us in a few months, so I stopped by.
Franky can't make it.  He had an appointment he forgot, he's going to see you later.  I'm Mickey Morrissey, we're supposed to get to know each other.
I didn't mean to be that rough.
No.
How often does this happen?
No, please! I Just want to talk to you!
Will you, Judy?
Judy, I want to tell you: these few days have been the first happy days I've had in a year.
Scottie!
Can't you see?
Did he train you? Rehearse you? Teach you what to say and what to do?
And you were such an apt pupil! What fun you two must have had, playing games with me! Why me? Why did he pick on me?!!
Ah, yes! I was a set-up. I was the made-to-order witness. Where is he now?
Lucky for me you were wandering about. Thank you again. I've been terrible bother to you.
I hope we will, too.
Meet again, sometime.
Where are you now?
Where?
Have you been here before?
I'm not mad. I'm not mad. And I don't want to die, but there's someone inside me, there's a somebody else, and she says I must die... Scottie, don't let me go!
My love... because I love you.
No... we're together...
Ow!!
It's this darned corset. It binds. He retrieves the stick.
Well, you know those police department doctors: no sense of style.  Ah, tomorrow!
Johnny!
What was this desperate urge to see me?
Well, I detected an undercurrent.
Fair enough. What'll we talk about at dinner?
What I've been doing?
The stripper's here.
Tonight we return once again to the cave. Tonight we let the monsters out. We fill ourselves with the spirits of Genghis Khan, Joe Namath, JFK, Paton, Lombardi, Hemingway...
Don't you threaten me you little rat fuck.
Go home!
Stop it! Listen to me. Let's just take a second here and take hold of the situation, OK? Let's just review our options here.
Call the police. Okay, that's one option.
We have to get going.
Honey, go in there and get some Starbursts.
They're screaming for Starbursts.
I want you to hear me out.
You and I have done nothing. You especially. We are innocent.
What?
Keith Richards, Dean Martin...
Tony? This is Keith Fisher. You're doing my wedding and I'm calling about the chair situation. Yeah, I'll hold.
That is a load of shit. Personal power has nothing to do with any of this. Tony Robbins has helped me to unlock energy and see my options more clearly, yes, but to give him credit for this, for all of this...Well that's just more than the man deserves.
What kind of words?
Jesus Boyd you're going to O.D. him.
Your ideas never work out.
Stop it!
Why do you feel the need to explore this side of your personality?
I'm talking about the kind of people you hang out with...about growing up, assuming responsibility of yourself.
I just think that at some point you're going to have to re-evaluate some of your friendships...
Charles Moore for instants.
It's not that I don't like him. But the wedding has really got me thinking and... I just keep myself opening up. Crowning. And I want you keeping up with me here.
I just don't see him in the big picture.
He's weird.
What's the word on the chairs?
I told Boyd two fucking minutes!
I'm getting married...
The first day.
We don't say "love, honor and obey" anymore. And we don't say "till death do us part." Today we say, "respect, honor and cherish, as long as you both do love." How does that sound?
Shut up Micheal.
They've got a real hen house here! You can't hear yourself speak.
I'm going to make you a nun's cake. It will make your mouth water.
You must think I'm mad.
Leave me now. You can go to bed.
They told us you'd be back tomorrow ...
What's the matter with you?
Why the bad temper?
Maybe afterwards he'll let me ...
Jorge, Don Jaime's son, at your service.
And ...your friend?
Is she coming back?
Why are you crying?
Don't invent stories; go to bed.
But why does he want to see me? He has never bothered about me.
What about you, Manuel?
I'm going to the hen house. Are you coming with me?
There's already a task force out looking for Lindenmeyer. Every other officer in the city will be hunting Sid right along with you.
This is the personnel file on the programmer, Lindenmeyer. There might be something in it you can use.
Ms. Deane, you wanted to see me?
What's the assignment?
You embarrassed me in front of the highestranking law enforcement official in the country.  Do you have any idea how much money you just cost me?
Of the six prison inmates you've tested  all of whom have had at least some military or survival training - only Mr. Barnes is still breathing.
You've had a yearandahalf to make all the adjustments you want, Lindenmeyer.  ) Elizabeth Deane does not give second chances. Neither do I. You're fired.
You are to turn over the Sid 6.7 program, and all its documentation, for immediate destruction. Is that understood?
Don't be angry with me, Daryl.
Should I have?
I don't need a babysitter.
Remember a few years ago when music schools were using a computerized teaching tool that accidently started frying kids' brains?
The government must have figured there was no better person to create a psycho than a psycho.
Don't get out of the car.
Grimes is back! He's back! He's come back!!!
You okay?
More or less.
My guess is dead.
What C-4...was Cox talking about?
...tonight...
What if he's busy tonight?
What are you saying...
...on the way in.
It's the White House.
A small, "calico" kitten, sir.  "Calico." 
<u>IT DESTROYED THE ELECTORAL PROCESS</u>.
...where?
We're going to have to explain away the...
Yes.
What do you know about them?
Precisely.
What did they ever do <u>for</u> us...?  You see, this is why we have to mobilize the B-2 Bomber.
None of these are ours.  <u>None</u> of em are ours....  ....that's <u>real politik</u>, Buddy.
Pride of a job-well-done...
Oh, MiGod.
I'd like to mention a few <u>names</u>, who...
I was acting as a Private Citizen.  Nothing that I've done should be construed as reflecting on the orders or intentions of anyone with whom you may have reason to believe I am connected with.  Or in whose <u>employ</u>...
And I take this <u>opportunity</u> to suggest that, equally, I admit to <u>nothing</u>, and that I would like my lawyer present.
YOUNG PERSON'S APARTMENT, NIGHT.
Hello...?
What's more interesting than boffing the girlscout?
String a few together.  All I need's eleven,
What do you think would hold it off?
I'm a Jew in Show Business.  Why come to me?
Here's the Short Course:  Fifty-Four, Forty or Fight. What does <u>that</u> mean?
Remember the Maine...
Tippecanoe and Tyler, Too!
What're you gonna do with Morse Code?
Yeah...?
Against...who could be aggressor....Help me out here...Units of 303, the Defense Department confirms, early this morning, Albanian Time, stormed a mountain hideaway, near the city of -- help me out here -- and freed a tired, but happy William Schumann, Suffering no casualties.

Moss's working on Big Bird's Inaugural.  Nine A.M...?  Nine?  Miss the commuters, but...

Who the hell's out there? What are the arbs saying? It's gotta be a big hitter.
Buddy boy, how ya doing?
Nice guy but a loser. Lost all his equity when his firm went belly up in the recession of 71. you wanna be coming in here in your late sixties still pitching? ... Whatever happened to that cute analyst at Thudder, Wicks? ... Cindy? Susan?
...Got a 100 on me, you...
...as far as being axed, I'm still here and as long as I am, I have a responsibility not just to me but to the union members I represent...
I'll be damned that when my men come to me tomorrow morning, wanting to know what's going on, I'm going to lie to them!
So, where are we going?
Chart break-out on this one here...uh Whitewood-Young Industries...low P.E. Explosive earnings. 30% discount from book. Great cash flow. Coupla 5% holders. Strong management.
Know the name?
Sir Larry Wildman. Like all Brits he thinks he was born with a better pot to piss in... bribed an old secretary of mine to open bar mouth and stole RDL Pharmaceuticals right out from under me. Wildman the white knight.
Got him at an auction in Kentucky.
Gordon, it's two minutes to close. What do you want to do?! Decide.
You know, the elevator man couldn't believe I paid $300,000 to have my walls looking like this, he's got them for free in Brooklyn.
You may not believe this Bud but I really do care for you. I think we could've made a good team...but that's how it goes...
I thought this was an informal meeting. What's he doing here?
You must be wearing a mask you're laughing so hard behind it Larry. Let's cut the "sir" crap. Correct me if I'm wrong, but when you took CNX Electronics, you laid off 8,000 workers, Jessmon Fruit about 6,000, that airline...
Anybody want another drink?
Jenkins.  Can I get you some help?
If my mother caught me up here she'd kill me.
Well?
That was very good.
These are good.
Of course.  You must be so proud.
Hello?
Love.
Have you ever felt so completely consumed by a feeling for someone that you couldn't breathe?  That the time together is so passionate and consuming that you felt physical pain when they would leave?
What was her major?
Someone's there.
In the window.  Norman's at work.
Does Norman know?
What?
Then what was it?
Something was there.  You saw it.
Yes.  Now I talked to Sela and there's a guy, this Pakistani guy down in Hartford...
And he's the real thing.  Specializes in cases like this, like yours.
But Claire--
But he acted like he'd never heard of it.
Jody he was lying.
I guess not.
Excellent.  Couple of Swedish sailor cells just gang divided a virginal cheerleader cell.
Of what?
Did she say that?
What do you mean?  Some noises where?
Did you call the police?
Our house.
Are you lonely?
You know I am.
"You know..."
The leaves...
Look for antiques...
Adamant.
Little village down seven.  Supposed to be charming.
Do you know it?
Lasher will act, Rowan.  Whatever it is he wants - he's waited three hundred years to have it.   facing him alone...  I don't like -
No scaredy-cats in the Talamasca, huh...?
Rowan.
You two sees like a perfect fit.   Only two mounths...?
You came.    I'm your Aunt Carlotta, my dear.
Did you like it...? Looking down at Graham and knowing what you could do...?
I am with you, my love. Like no other can ever be.
I know that you're evil.
And now you expect me to stockpile corpses for you...?!
Rowan and I will be together now. My time has come.  Your time is gone.
Just one.  The bar's closed.
You know - doors and keyholes are common signposts in out-of-body -
you touched him --- and saw him...? What was he doinging.  Kinky...?
Michael - I have to go - to New Orleans. I'll - I'll call yati when I -
What about your work back home...?
Aren't we supposed to love somebody for their moral rectitude or their courage or their beneficence -
Michael - what made you fall in love with me...?
I can't.
I'm getting --- left behind.
OH MY GAWD!
I shouldn't say this - but you really remind me of someone I know
I wasn't a manager here then MRS STECKLER - don't you remember?
So what do you do?
My mother...?  I never knew my real MOTHER - I was adopted
Where are you going?
I don't want either of us to come to any harm - please...
What brings the rats out of the sewers?
Good - I've got to dash -  Say that I said hello to ELLEN for me would you...
Someday, I'll find out.
This is like my every wet dream come true.  I don't even care that you're here, too, bro.
Oh, how inappropriate is that!
How would you like it if I did that to your mother's panties?
Never say never.
I thought I'd be nervous, but you sure know how to make a girl feel relaxed, Teddy Bear.
I have to admit, I am so totally turned on. We should do it. Now.
You have to understand. This was a big shock, for all of us. One minute you're our little boy, of whom we could not be more proud. The next minute you're the owner of this whole pornographic empire.
Sorry I--
Who exactly ARE you?
No problem, consider it done.  I had this idea of shooting on location. Outdoors, you know? Maybe at some famous Xenia landmarks. You think that would be a problem?
If you could just sign right there.
What is it, William Randolph? Your balls need scratching?
In what sense?
Ah ha! It was so well hidden, you didn't even know it was there.
Just because someone died and made you king of the publishing world doesn't mean you're even one ounce smarter than you were a week ago.
I'm still better than you. Nothing changed except the decimal point in your savings account.
I can't believe your dad built this for you.
Whatever.
He cared enough to want you to have it.
I see.
Now it makes sense, the whole neo Bohemian, down with hypocrisy, fight the power crap. You're a poor little rich girl.
You think my dad would have been like that if I knew him? You think he would have bought me a stadium, instead of teaching me how to play ball?
I mean my father.
It's all so complicated.
I feel like I'm being drawn and quartered. Like every part of me is being pushed and pulled and tugged in a different direction.
And then what?
You're amazing.
Even when you infuriate me, I still want to kiss you.
Julie, wow. I was afraid you left. I was afraid I'd never see you again.
Oh, good lord. Are those Neptunes?
You promise you'll finish school?
You kicked us off your turf, Merk. Don't rain on our parade.
What law, Merk? Having fun? Letting down our hair on prom night?
You called the cops on us?
You're the Sultan of Semen. The Monarch of Masturbation. The Merchant Prince of Lust. You. Ted. Are the King of Coitus.
The Supreme Sovereign of Sexuality.
I loved my brother. I stood by his wishes to let his son run the company. A son he never knew. A son that he and his wife gave away at birth. A son who was raised in a world quite different from our own. Nevertheless, I was there for the lad. I guided him as best I could. But he's only seventeen, with a mind of his own and judgment that is, well, frankly, not a chip off the old block. There is only one clear solution...  And I think we all know what that is--
All I can tell you Sam, is hang in there.  They clear you of this mess, you get reinstated, with back pay...
Got sort of hung up on her, from what hear.
No.  Not after that night.  I don't know what happened.  Maybe he caught her with some john... All I know is, the next morning the girl was gone and there was a dead boy... Indian kid named Davy.  Used to live down the road there in a wrecked car. Him and Suzie were at the Glades that night.  It was right after that, Ray got Suzie busted and sent her away.  That's what there is to say about Ray Duquette.
Isn't that against the law, peeking into windows?
You remember that little girl walked out of our talk at Blue Bay?
This is where she lives.  She wants to talk.  Beats the shit out of me why she would call me at all.  I busted her once for possession.  she wound up doing about six months at Camp Nine.
We all have...
That bothers you?
Are you crazy, Ray?
Ray.  The conversation on this tape is totally unintelligible.  What we have here, is you on the Van Ryan property, without a proper warrant, shooting a porn flick...
Ms. Toller?
I can't believe you called Sam.  What's the matter with you?
Get off my property.
Don't forget the car wash.
The only way we're gonna blow this now, is if we do it ourselves...
We have to stick with the plan.
Good thinking.
Forget it.
No.
It doesn't look like it.
But she ran away.
But I..
I can't, Sandy.  I've got to run.
Sorry, Sandy.  I've got plans.
Attractive buttons, yes?  But yank one off, toss it, and poof!  It emits a cloud of sleeping gas.
Always hoping.  Or this...
Good Lord, man.  The world is changing.  And mark me, it is always the criminal mind that is the first to exploit modern invention.  We, as defenders of the right, must keep pace!
You feeling all right?
So... what happened?
Uh... how long ago was this?
Willard...
It was in your book.
You didn't tell us you had this on!
Oh, don't worry.  I've already overlooked the fact your name's not actually on our guest list.
Doyle's the name, sir.  Of the Connemara Doyles.  And there's not a man riding the rails who holds a candle to meself.  That having been said, sir, you're five minutes late so let's be on our way!  Your friend's already aboard.
... well, of course you can.  Mr. President, what a surprise.  What brings you here?
You got that right.  Now get up. We're walking out of here.
This is something.
It's you they're after, Madmarti- gan.  What did you do this time?
Why can't you do it?  You have mag- ical powers.
Mmmm, I love the smell of a woman.
We're a tiny version of all that?
What's that?  I hear something!
Because she's sick.
She said lots of thing.s
Dada, what's a daikini?
How am I gonna do that?
How??
Are you sure?
This is not going well.
How could you do this to me tonight? I told you I had company
I saw him.
Last guy I would have figured. But he's part of it.
If I did, I'd have kept my mouth shut...  It fits, Paul... Fifty-five gallons of P2P confiscated four years ago... Guess who was in on the collar? Mac.  He salts it away somewhere... he knows the stuff is potent, but the street chemists haven't figured out how to process it. But they do now.  And now the stuff is worth five-grand a pint and there are a lot of pints in a fifty-five gallon drum.
Just us.
More people... Gotta pick up where Zenovich left off. People from outside the department.
Whacking?
Believe me, I'm trying to get this over with as fast as I can. But Samuel will probably have to come back and testify.
But John... why didn't you go to a hospital?
But why?
The... bullets?
I got there late, John.
Elaine, I've come to apologize for Lt. McElroy. He overstated the department's position.
Of course, Elaine. But as long as there's any question, better Johnny should come back and clear his name.
Elaine, I don't want to have to take you in for questioning. You've got his car, you were the last to see him 
How can this be? How can you do such a thing? Is this plain? Is this the ordnung?
Eh? Nothing? Rachel, you bring this man to our house. With his gun of the hand. You bring fear to this house. Fear of English with guns coming after. You bring blood and whispers of more blood. Now English music... and you are dancing to English music! And you call this nothing?
No sin? Maybe. Not yet. But, Rachel, it does not look...  Don't you know there has been talk? Talk about you, not him. Talk about going to the Bishop. About having you... shunned!
Get back in there.
Oh, we dream lots of silly things when we --
...resourceful!
What are you going to do with my dog?  Give him back to me!
Oh, please give me back my dog!
But the Good Witch of the North told me not to.
...Toto, too?
Oh, now?
I had the measles once -- and she stayed right by me every minute.
Where do you want to be oiled first?
We might.
...yes.
Ho -- ho --ho -- ho
As Monarch of the Forest I don't like the situation.
...yes.
But you've just been saying how much you want a heart.
Oh --
...excellence to the Miracle Wonderland Carnival Company -- until one day, while performing spectacular feats of stratospheric skill never before attempted by civilized man, an unfortunate phenomena occurred. The balloon failed to return to the fair.
Stop pushing!
Now, let' s see -- this goes -- Oh, I wish I were better at puzzles.
...junk!
Quiet!
Oh!  Oh, come on, come on!
Help! Help! Help! Help! Help!
They tore my legs off, and they threw them over there! Then they took my chest out, and they threw it over there!
What about us?
What about the heart that you promised Tin Man --?
-- And the courage that you promised Cowardly Lion?
Shame you had to spot I wasnt the real thing.
Hes sealed himself in.
Old friend?
The report King bought. Its a manual. Renards men used it to remove this radio tracking device from the warhead.
Theyre getting their weapons from the Russians, but where are they getting the money to buy the weapons?  I cant help thinking...the person close to King, the one who switched that pin...
Today, of all days, the sun decides to shine.
A word? Im sure by now hes engineered a hostile takeover.
No!  It will cave in!
You knew when you first saw me.  You knew it would be like this.
So you killed your father.
Really Bond, couldnt you find a nice Russian scientist with hair growing out of his ears?
I thought you were the one in her business.
What is this place?
This is the end.
As you can see, we may be able to salvage a good-sized chunk of the farm belt.
We don't really know, sir, but bluntly, our survival capability . . . may depend on a quirk of the weather.
Rorschach's on the case.  He's got Dreiberg in a lather.  He seems to think that someone is "stalking" the Watchmen.
What's your theory?
Jon -- there's something I have to know.  Did you love me once?
Yet you must've known all along that you'd give me cancer.  Just be being with me.
But you knew that I'd -- die.
I know, I know, it's just -- he's back on the street, he smells blood.
He's bound to get caught.  I don't want my name coming out.  Not at this late date.
No.  I just wanted you to --
Damn straight.
Of course, we looked like idiots in those bondage outfits.
Hey.  You remember that nut in the hockey mask?  With the asthma? What was his name . . .
That's the one.  Whatever happened to him?
Ohh.  I could use some dinner.  Who was that on the phone?
Missed 'em Dan.  You're aiming high!
They're practically on us . . .
Dan -- what do we do now?
We're running, Rorschach.  We've got no place to go.  We're hightailing it down to Adrian's.
Cases, leads -- they don't matter, Rorschach.  The world's about to end.  If someone is trying to kill us, it doesn't matter.
No comment.
I did not.  Now get out of my way!
I don't know who you are buddy, but I swear to God, you got the wrong guy.
Most guys we ran through this either took off or helped them rob the place. I expected you to do the same.
Whether you thought this was for real or not, you jumped in and helped the waitress on instinct. That tells me something about your character.
It's your lucky day. You just might get the chance to pay back our wonderful country for all the freedom you enjoy.
Alright, Cage, you've got me. This is one of those moments. "Many are called, few are chosen", that kind of thing. Your government needs you. Are you up for the challenge?
Why is that?
Oh I don't know, I think the tests work pretty well. Sometimes they give me answers you wouldn't admit to in a million years.
You've got this wrong. You're not under arrest, you've been abducted. And until I say different, you belong to me.
Sure as gravity. I've had a feeling about you from the start, Cage. It's nausea.
You did say "Ahab"? You're sure about that?
This is good work, X, damn fine work. You need to press on at all costs, find out what they have planned with this "Ahab".
Whatchu doing here?
If you got a problem with me, why are we dancing?
You do everything Yorgi says?
It's gonna be like that, huh? You got all bent out of shape as soon as he started dancing with someone else. Why's that?
I can't let this happen. I want you to go out the back. I'll make up some excuse.
Where's he headed?
What was that for?
You've been so quiet lately, Petra, I thought you no longer cared.
French Polynesia? This wouldn't last us a week in a cheap hotel. Do you know how expensive it is down there?
It's not about the money, X! You never plan for anything. I can't live like that anymore, I need some stability.
Heads up, man. What's this thing on my back?
Very nice. I'm impressed.
That was for Anders.
Scott.. I -
What are you talking about?
I've served with men like you before. Methodical.  Systematic -- Naive.  You know what happens to those men in a real fight?
Ms. Grey -- you work at a school for mutants in Westchester, New York.  Can you tell the members of this committee what exactly you are teaching these mutants?
You wouldn't happen to be teaching them how to use their powers to --
Where am I?
Don't you knock?
This checkmate goes to you.  I didn't want to hurt anyone.  But you leave me no choice.
Give him an extra dollar.
Still happy you married me?
Love me oodles and oodles?
So this is what it's like to be completely happy!
What a strange fellow.
Well... we'll see.
I don't think so.  Is my assistant taken care of?
In conclusion... it should be noted that more than common injury to the nerve roots is always serious, because... once a nerve fibber is severed... there is no way to regenerate life back into it.  Are there any more questions before we leave?
There.
There wolf!  There castle!
I thought you wanted to.
Taking the book along?
You can't win 'em all.
What's the point of my setup? It's not funny unless you repeat exactly what you said.
Come on, big fellow!
Yes, master.  Are you sure you want to go through with it?
What's that tune that you're playing
Dr. Fronkonsteen -- look!
Let me come with you, Doctor, please!  I don't want to stay up here alone.
It looks that way.
It's terrible -- the price society demands in the name of fidelity... ultimately?
I know, but I mean -- not fooling around physically?... Or not fooling around intellectually?
There can never... ever... be anything physical between us. You know that, dear.
Sweetheart.....Is this really you???
Oh, must be around ten... ten-thirty.
Splendid horsemanship  Who are they?
Splendid site, Crealock, splendil I want to establish Camp here immediately.
